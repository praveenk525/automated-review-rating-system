rating,review
1,this has to be the worst recipe ever what a waste of good food in a poorly contrived meal is there a way to get my money back for all the fresh shrimp i wasted going back to the real recipes of the south
1,way to watery
1,this was a big disappointment all i could taste was the flour so anyone that makes this recipe should use less flour i might make this again but would defintely not use tbs of flour i think you need to experiment with this recipe to come up with the correct measurements i did go ahead and serve this but threw out the remainder
1,this was gross too much flouryuck
1,the description says maybe its the cream cheese where is the cream cheese in the recipe ingredients it says sour cream and whipping cream not cream cheese
1,i do not recommend this recipe the cooking times are way off and there was so much juice in the pie i had to dump most of the juice out
1,my pie turned out beautiful and then i cut into it full of liquid and overly sweet such a disappointment
1,this was terrible it looked good when i took it out of the oven and when i cut into it a ton of liquid came out i was so excited to make the pie and ended up just throwing it away would not recommend
1,the pie is tooooooo sweet use less sugar
1,this isnt pie this is soup i dont know if the creator forgot to add a step or what but my finished product was more liquid than apple if this is grandmas recipe she must have had soft teeth recipe should be removed
1,i love your recipes but wasnt a crazy about this on
1,worst apple pie filling recipe ever i followed the instructions exactly and after an hour of cooling i cut the first piece i had to drain more than a cup of liquid out of it im so upset flavor is also lacking i cannot tell you how disappointed i am with this recipe
1,i make corn pudding with fresh corn cut off the cob i have no use for canned crap
1,enchiladas are made with corn tortillas not flour tortillas this is a burrito
1,if you have ever traveled to mexico you will not find a flour tortilla thus enchiladas are made with corn tortillas not flour that is why some reviewers say they get soggy
1,enchiladas are made with corn tortillas
1,one star because the directions say to use butter butter is not in the ingredients list except for the glaze the directions are incomplete
1,this recipe claims the prep is mins it has been over hour and mins and i have only managed to chop my potatoes make the gravy which wasnt enough to cover my meat so ill be making another batch and cook pork chop will never make again i only made pork chops because i was so hunrgry and felt like passing out didnt have the energy to make the other chops it took hour and mins to bake on for an hour then for mins the flavor was delicious og the gravy i added some garlic in it an my potatoes were perfect but my chops were dry tasting my grandma used to bake her chops with potatoes and i was craving it but this is definently not my grandmas way of making it her chops were very juicy and delicious and the gravy was more liquid like but she is passed so the recipe is still a mystery but this helped curbed that craving i do suggest not adding salt to this dish because the chicken broth already has alot of salt in it
1,pim sorry the one star is all about the flour i am actually mad at myself as i should have known better making this recipe the flour should have been added with the onions and mushrooms and cooked all i could taste in the final product was t of raw flour it ruined the soup for me and i had to dump it as did one of the other reviewers i am surprised that your daughter in law who is a gourmet cook didnt know this but maybe something got lost in translation i am posting this not to be mean but to suggest that this will be a good soup if you cook that flourppjanep
1,this was terrible i followed the recipe exactly it tasted fine until i added the sour cream and whipping cream then it turned into a thin white flavorless soup do not bother
1,my husband and i didnt like it because of the flour tortillas should use corn tortillas he thought bottom tortillas were hard from the baking i had leftovers next day and the tortillas were mushy pretty gross also it bubbled over onto the bottom of my oven the last minutes uncovered in an x pyrex
1,although this sounds good to some it is not by any means our favourite pork chop recipe ours is still from the applewood smoker on the deck bbqd or smoked chops are the absolute best breaded with spices and panko egg wash flour etc is the next done the way in this recipe they become a little too tough and relatively tasteless definitely will not make this one
1,lasagna made with cottage cheese disgusting lasagna is made with ricotta cheese
1,i love so many of the recipes posted on taste of home but this is not one i would give it a on taste test but the biggest problem is what the slow cooker does to the noodles the noodles are so overcooked you cannot hardly tell what is sauce and what is noodle i like a firmer noodle i also cut the cooking time down an hour but still no better did anyone else have this problem i might try it again but cook in the oven
1,i did not care for this at all dry and not flavorful maybe because i used a bigger crock pot then the quart i did everyhting else as the recipe said only cooked for hours i prefer the oven baked version sorry
1,did not care for i would much rather make mine in the oven
1,did not care for this recipe lasagna was very juicy also to much salt prefer a baked version
1,wish i had read more reviews it was awful i baked it minutes longer than indicated and still the apples are not cooked the filling is liquid i used a mix of honeycrisp and granny smith ive been baking for years but am looking for a no fail apple pie it was a beautiful pie unfortunately it was inedible a huge waste of an afternoon
1,im sorry to say we thought it was quite disappointing it was missing something but i dont know what even tried adding some sweet hot chili sauce but still lacking flavor wont be making this again
1,came out like soup with tbs of liquid the apples didnt get soft
1,i had to toss the cake in the garbage it didnt bake all the way i tried to add some time but that didnt work either i have been baked for over years and the only other cake i had to toss was when i was in my teens i have no idea what i did wrong the flavor was there but it would not setup good luck
1,i love cherry desserts and i wanted this recipe to be as delicious and special as so many reviews said however it was so plain tasting
1,this recipe was horrible i cannot understand how so many reviewers rated it so high i will definitely not be making this again
1,nasty doesnt taste good unless you put tons of brown sugar on it otherwise it tastes likes grapes with mayonnaise gross my friends hated it what a waste of money
1,i thought it was boring
1,this pie is very heavy on crusttopping it definitely needs some flavoring cinnamon nutmet etc very bland will not make again
1,i am sorry to say this there are some ingredients missing i am dutch and this is no dutch apple pie appeltaart
1,awfulthese were so bland i made them exactly as written and i had to make a decision whether to just throw away or try to salvage i ended up adding salt garlic milk cheese cooked some pasta and made a chicken mac n cheese it was edible and saved pounds of chicken breast
1,honestlythis was truly the grossest soup ive ever made and i was so excited
1,at a loss how this recipe became a contest winnerhad better in a hobo camp
1,made this for xmas breakfast it was the most tasteless breakfast casserole i have ever madeglad i also made biscuits and sausage gravy i had that i had to throw in the garbage would not recommend at all too many other great breakfast casseroles available
1,very bland
1,sounded interesting so i gave it a try this was much too sweet and the bottom was hard ill stick with my old triedandtrue
1,i followed the recipe exactly except that i omitted the nuts the dough is so dry it wont hold together i added tbsp of water i was expecting a much much nicer tasting and nicer looking cookie i went with this recipe because of a the reviews and b the ratio of oatmeal to flour will never make them again i got dozen buttons about diameter i see the other reviews and shake my head as to what went wrong maybe i should have added another egg or two but wont bother trying this recipe again sorry
1,every year for our family picnic my sisternlaw brings this pastry it doesnt make any difference if there is or in attendance theres always at least to of the pastry left over you would think that would be a hint that most dont care for it this july is was a goopy mess it had to be scooped out of the pan it was certainly under baked if you like the store bought kuchensdanishstreusel that is baked in the foil tins then youll probably like this because in my opinion thats exactly what it tastes like
1,i am sorry am i reading this correct the recipes makes dozen this doesnt sound right for a x pan
1,not a fan cup of flour created a stiff gloopy glue surely this must be an error i ended up adding some extra milk cream chicken stock just trying to make it a little more smooth it is extremely bland as well i added some garlic but would suggest adding some of that old bay others have suggested i seriously cant understand how this is award winning or how some people ended up with it being runny after adjusting the consistency of the sauce i was able to create a lasagna i added a little mozzarella to the top my youngest son thought it was good but not great probably best for those who prefer a bit of a bland palate
1,edemars x x x
1,i made this last night it was the worst pie it tasted so disgusting something wasnt right with the filling it had a weir taste all i can say it was horrible threw the pie out
1,way to much cheese to little eggs only out people finished it
1,where do i start way to sweet the corn amp sweet peas do not make good lovers this isnt any minute meal by a very long shot maybe a few peas and carrots i used tomato paste instead of ketchup i can only imagine how sweet it wouldve been with the ketchup i used beef broth i never like the granules or cubes the after taste makes me want to hurl right now i hate throwing food in the garbage but another meal of this wasnt going to happen i even added some fresh ground pepper to cut the sweetness thank the heavens for pepper i looked forward to eating this recipe and i am very bummed about throwing down the drain fellow culinary participantsstay away from this recipe very sad right now if i could give no stars i would
1,i didnt care for it it sounded good i thought i would like it it makes a lot i took it to a large gathering and brought a lot of it home i will never make it again
1,i was so disappointed with this recipe it tasted like sugar and vinegar i double checked and measured correctly it was not edible
1,this recipe is sickenly sweet way too rich
1,surprisingly not a hit with the group of teen guys i fed it to i think it was too mushy not enough substance i make a similar trifle dish but with much more brownies to make it more cake like too much trouble and not even one person said they liked it
1,i didnt enjoy the texture or the taste of this dessert but my kids liked it
1,made according to recipe and we found it extremely spicy and salty not sure what happened here as i can see all the star reviews glad everyone else enjoyed it
1,this was just ok the sauce was watery from the frozen raviolis and they were doughy my husband who loves lasagna couldnt eat this i reheated the next day and the sauce was less watery and the taste was slightly improved but i will not be making this again
1,i was so excited to try this cake followed the recipe to a t i cannot understand why it has good reviewsit is horrible utterly horrible i would not recommend this to anyone i cook all the time in case anyone thinks i am a newbiei am not this recipe just is not worth making awful
1,i just had a question but had to add a star to ask it so i gave it star do you think this would be a good base for tres leches cake
1,didnt turn out well
1,the crumb topping is good but the sugar part with the apples is way to sweet
1,not sure what everyone is raving about my family didnt like this at all way to sweet and the instant pudding is just weird
1,i didnt care for this one either as another reviewer noted its very rich and i love seafood too i ended up throwing it out
1,extremely disappointed while it was tasty i added oregano and garlic to the sauce it came out a wet mess since i drained the meat mixture well and used sauce right from the can without adding water all i can think is minutes isnt nearly long enough to saltdrain the zucchini which i pressed to drain in the strainer and then squeezed in a towel
1,did not like it at all
1,total disaster i did exactly as the recipe stated the only salvageable thing was the crust it looked like a cornstarch slurry mess i will never make this again
1,i was really excited to make this soup after reading all the great reviews i have to agree with the one review i read that said it was basically hamburger helper without noodles actually i think hamburger helper tastes better then this the only change i made was to add a some bacon at the end my husband and i did not care for this at all
1,if you cant remove the lid how can you insert a toothpick see when the dumplings are done i am confused
1,i was really disappointed after reading many of the reviews i decided to make this recipe it is the worst banana nut bread recipe ive made i really have no idea how it was a contest winning recipe
1,this receipe is is terrible very heavy texture and very sweet would not recommend this to any one its was a big waste to make it make out heavier than a brick
1,pi just pulled this out of the oven and havent tasted it yet used the correct sized pans but the loaves wouldnt bakeit took about an hour and a half and then the tops burnedthey looked too full as i was filling the pans up should i have used pansp
1,too salty i even omitted the pre salting lacked substancewaste of my good zucchini
1,my family didnt like it the zucchini was too soggy
1,four out of four adults in this family did not care for this at all it was too rich and greasy with all the cheese
1,did not like at all
1,this was one of the worst recipe i have ever tried from your site it was a total mush bunch of green goop and i had to throw it out what a waste of my time it preparing it
1,im always amazed how people rate a recipe and then state how they changed the recipe significantly so after reading all the comments ive read im not sure whether to even try the recipe why people cant just do a recipe without changing it is beyond me how do they know what the real recipe is like to even begin to rate it
1,horrible
1,made this in hopes of taking it to my church for thanksgiving dinnerthe worst pie ever ive made many regular pies that always come out ideal this one burnt around the edges was thin after stirring in the apples and vanilla it ran over in my ovena complete waste of my time and money never again
1,not sure why but we just didnt like the flavor of this it does make a lot of gravy so i understand why mashed potatoes are the suggested side i added carrots and potatoes to the crock pot and the flavors just didnt work well together
1,very disappointed with this recipe i bake a lot and this recipe looked very interesting but not what i expected it was very dense i was expecting it to be much lighter i followed the recipe exactly if you want light and fluffy and moist this is not the cake for you
1,i made this yesterday if it wasnt for the chocolate frosting i would of thrown it out it is so heavy and not much flavor to it we didnt like it
1,unfortunately my fudge never setup i left it in the fridge for several hours i even tried the freezer for a little while but it didnt help it tastes good but i cant give it to anyone else
1,gooey gummy never sat up even tried the freezer i might reheat and try as n ice cream toppingwaste of time and
1,made as directed but extremely bland i should have trusted my instincts and added some frozen green peas and a little shredded cheese among other things not nearly enough salt for anyones taste this one is a loser
1,this is the highest rated recipe on the whole site hamburger and potatoes swimming in processed cheese and loaded with calories carbs fat and sodium this looks like hamburger helper only someone forgot the pasta and threw in potato chunks ground beef swimming in melted processed cheese is the best of the best im surprised the instructions didnt suggest dipping some mayonnaise on white bread sandwiches in it to complete the theme
1,i rated this recipe as it was written first it was pretty bland so i added a small chopped onion a minced garlic clove a handfull sliced mushrooms and t chicken soup base then i made the dumplings and i wondered about the thin consistency but cooked them anyway they never did cook all the way through more like dough lumps and the tasted bitter i ended up fishing them out and made another batch with c of bisquick and cooked them as directed on the box minutes uncovered and another with the lid on perfect dumplings although by now the broth had reduced to nothing and i was literally left with chicken and dumplings
1,this soup is so unhealthy it should have a warning label heres to obesity
1,very bland
1,no flavor at all
1,horrible recipe i am actually quite surprised it turned out so horribly i spent on all the ingredients and almost knew it would turn out amazing due to all the great reviews and five star rating there was not nearly enough sauce to call it lasagna the flavors were way too strong and the pork sausage was the wrong choice there was also not enough lasagna noodles in this recipe so many things i didnt like about this dish what a waste of food and time dont waste your time
1,i followed this recipe exactly and it was pretty awful it tasted like mayo with a little bacon flavor thrown in this is the first time ive made a recipe with this many good reviews that turned out so badly beware unless you love eating mayo straight from the jar
1,i found this to be a rather horrible recipe the pankcakes came out very thick would not brown correctly and were quite tasteless what a waste of good ingredients
1,dont call it traditional and include cottage cheese what a disaster
1,this is a disaster too long cooking waste of time and money
1,i was super excited to make big fluffy ginger cookies i bought new ingredients sorry to say these cookies turned out flat just like the crunchier ones ive made they were softer but the flavor lacked the prominate ginger taste ill go back to my old recipe next time as they had a better flavor sandy in spokane wa
1,did not like this one
1,disappointing this recipe calls more liquid than most of other hot milk cake recipes because of numerous good reviews i didnt doubt to try it i baked twice followed the exact method exact scale of ingredients but both didnt turn out well note that i didnt overwhip the eggs or overfold i went to a baking academy and ive been baking for more than years if youre looking for fluffy hot milk cake definitely do not try this recipe if youre up to really dense dense cake maybe you could try this recipe maybe this is why you shouldnt take recipes from the internet i highly doubt these good reviews are real as the youtube views for this recipe is considered low i wont be making these again ill try to find other hot milk cake recipes
1,absolutely horrible cake recipe ive been baking for a long time and this has to be the worst cake recipe ive ever tried a total waste of ingredients i followed the recipe to a t didnt over mix over fold and it had the worst texture very dense and almost gummy feeling i wish i could give this stars this is the first time ive been truly disappointed by a recipe on this site
1,very bad experience do not try the batter was so lumpy even though i used everything stated above with exact quantity then when i baked it it didnt even rise properly and tasted gross ive been making hot milk cake with a different recipe but i wanted to try a new recipe and now regretting my decision
1,this is fantastic everyone loved it and yes i will definitely make this again
1,this is by far the worse recipe i have used for banana breadit calls for way too much oili bake dog treats for a living and they smell better than this bread
1,terrible never cooked through even after hours i checked to make sure i had added all ingredients correctly so sad it had such good reviews the part that did cook was super bland i will definitely be trying another recipe
1,how old was your dog
1,so disappointing not good at all threw it all out
1,this had a good flavour but using pkg dressing mixes not a good idea as i read the ingr and has way too much sodium and chemicals not good for you better to go make your own route
1,disgusting didnt set properly and had to throw it away waste of ingredients i ignored the bad reviews and thought i could make it work but it turned out rubbish definitely do not recommend use another recipe
1,extremely plain and flavorless i have a favorite yellow cake recipe but always like to try new things just in case something better might come along this was disappointing to say the least i even added extra vanilla and a touch of cinnamon because the batter tasted like a boxed pancake mix and i always spice up my pancakes if you like plain bland cake then this is for you
1,something in this recipe is way off with the ingredients my bread was not all all the correct mix of ingredients
1,have not made this would like to know what recipe to follow did any one make it by the original recipe and how many star did it get
1,taste of home use to be real recipes by real cooks this recipe is terrible its full of prepackaged fake ingredients artificial colors artificial flavors preservatives way too much salt and is very unhealthy do not feed this recipe to your family cook real food
1,very tasty but it has well over of a persons daily requirement of sodium i would avoid eating this except is very small amounts
1,this was the sweetest thing ive ever eaten in my entire life i could have completely skipped the sugar and it would have been fine unless youre using unsweetened whipped cream and jello i promise you its going to be way too sweet for you the consistency was also nothing like the above photo you have to let the pretzel mixture cool completely before adding the filling or the whipped cream just melts and theres no texture i would even recommend putting it in the fridge to get super cold before putting the filling on it i had a headache after eating this because of the sugar so like i said before skip the sugar
1,followed this recipe to the t it sucked
1,mine was a total disaster raw in the middle and so dense i cut the crust thinly off and they were yum i think the recipe is confusing as i read it cups of water and cups flour then it asked me to add mix till smooth well it was dough at that point couldnt add in any more flour
1,there are much better white bread recipes out there recipes that use milk rather than water make a much better bread that is easier to slice and use for sandwiches disappointing
1,has dairy my family are lactose intolerant
1,disappointed these are not bars this is a recipe for cake
1,not impressed not very moist or flavorful
1,i am definitely in the minority here i really really disliked this recipe i made it exactly as stated using a bag of angel hair cabbage it was so wet i added a second bag and it was still too wet it was so sweet i added three tablespoons of horseradish and could barely tell i added any i gave up and took it to a gathering with a sprinkling of smoky paprika on top very little of it was eaten it continued to get more watery with standing and looked less and less appealing
1,way too much salt
1,mine burnt so disappointed followed your directions and it burnt before i could pour it will never use this recipe again what a waste of time and money
1,very underwhelmed with all the fabulous reviews i was hoping for so much more followed recipe exactly but didnt have hot saucemightve helped a little but i doubt enough to make me want to make again
1,i wouldnt bother with this recipe again very little flavor except cauliflower instructions are iffy at best cups of water to cover the veggies really my boyfriend amp i ate it but i threw the rest of it out as well as the recipe itself
1,i tried this for the first time and will not try again as soon as the sugar and milk started a rolling boil i timed minutes exactly and by the time i got the marshmellow cream in the pan the peanut butter was so hard and had to be scraped from pan
1,got started making this and realized most the ingredients covered by an add
1,how ridiculous your sponsored ingredient eggs put an ad you cant close over half the ingredients so thanks for that i would have loved to make these
1,i had great hopes for this recipe after reading the reviews but we were very disappointed i made it for dinner last night and the only adjustments i made were to add white wine to produce more sauce but it was still far too dry and to top the pasta with the shrimp mixture before broiling we also thought it was very bland with the amount of garlic and lemon juice we thought it would taste better ive been thinking about how to improve it add lemon zest saute the shrimp in the butteroil instead of simmering in the liquid ive decided to use other shrimp scampi recipes instead the crispy broiled topping was wonderful so will try that with another recipe
1,this recipe was given to me by my neighbor i thought i would make it today and it turned out horrible omg it was terrible the bread did not rise at all im not sure why this happened im not sure why everyone has given this bread recipe five stars if i could i would give it zero i have made bread before and it always turned out great i followed the directions to the tee i am thinking i should have used bread flour instead of allpurpose flour i am very disappointed im planning on throwing this recipe in the garbage i plan on making bread from the youtube channel jenny can cook now jenny can make delicious bread and it turns out good every time
1,sorry but i gotta agree with kristalcrystalsounded goodliked most reviewslove teriyaki saucebutthis was awful im sorry but very dry over cooked chicken sweet yes and altho i do love salt even too much for mereally appreciate you submitting the recipe honestly because i made it liking the looks of it but just didnt work
1,i have been making a form of this recipe for years without the salts doesnt need it with the mayo and prepared mustard also i thinly slice celery into it
1,made this for a lodge dinner for substituted chicken hindquarters for thighs because i needed a real heman main dish doubled the sauce nothing but raves from both men and women a keeper for sure
1,im confused this recipe was under low carb but is far from low carb was this misfiled on the site
1,i made this for supper my husband said he liked it but frankly i did not i will not be making this again
1,hrs was way to long but i knew that and cooked for hrs and min like many i used brown sugar and added a couple more pieces of garlic it turned out really well but as written it would have been like eating shoe leather most crockpots heat differently so pull out a piece at hrs and see if the internal temp is reaching degrees if so they are ready to eat
1,too bad and too sweet
1,the recipe is too salty
1,the frosting was awful way to sweet in fact my husband and i had to eat around it i will keep the cake recipe its very moist the frostings got to gotamara carrpinole ca
1,three cups of brown sugar is this a typo i just threw this cake in the trash it boiled over in the oven it fell apart i am an experienced cake baker not making this again it tasted like pure sugar
1,i tried to make this cake but for some reason i ended up making brownies i literally have no idea how this happened from the other reviews it seems like a good cake so i might just have to try again at least i have a good recipe for brownies now for finished product for how funny it was when i took the brownies out of the oven
1,i see that people are substituting coffee for the water when do you add coffeewater i dont see it in the instructions
1,i do not recall ever seeing beans used in tacos or lasagna
1,horrible bars were super dense no flavor super disappointed
1,didnt like it too creamy too rich i didnt feel good after having it sour cream amp whipping cream is overkill wouldve been better with just whipping cream
1,i was so eager to try this reciped for a friend who loves pumpkin spiced cupcakes i made this recipe to the t using all of the same ingredients following the instructions exactly and making sure to bake them at the right temperature and everything i dont understand but my cupcakes are coming out songeymushy and not rising at all i dont think its the baking powder because i just bought a new one the other day if anyone knows why this is happening id really appreciate it if you could let me know really sad the batter and frosting will all have to go to waste
1,fail followed the recipe to par but the bread didnt rise at all not sure what eent wrong but the flour didnt rise before or during baking any suggestion or idea why
1,i was disappointed in this bread i wonder if the tablespoon of salt is correct i dont think i have ever added tablespoon of salt to anything i have made i thought this bread tasted too salty i didnt have canola oil so i used olive oil and sprayed the pans with pam not sure if those things had anything to do with the salty taste i will not be making this again
1,why is this listed under low carb recipes not even close
1,the pancake looked like a potatoe pancake would not brown
1,i didnt like this at all way to much cheese i wish i would have followed my first thought of only adding half the cheese i gave some to my neighbors and they too felt the same way
1,horrible in every aspect possible i thought id try a new recipe for pancakes that were a bit fluffier but the batter was absolutely worthless
1,this was disgusting these were flat and terrible i followed the recipe precisely i wish i could show you a picture of how gross these turned out i have no idea what these other people are talking about
1,no bland and dry yes i followed the recipe into the garbage after so much prep yes im irritated
1,ugh black forest ham with a good aged swiss cheese should be left to enjoy on your favorite bread caramelized everything else over powered the ham and cheese too sweet and greasy high in calories timeconsuming and costly a very poor use of poppy seeds
1,way to much sugar for me this is more like cake just needs strawberries and whipped cream
1,i only have two pans how do i adjust the ingredients and will it look bad with tiers
1,why bother to see recipes if you cant print them do the publishers to follow the recipe on your phone while making it
1,i would give this minus stars if i could followed the directions exactly the crust was mushy and the layers were just way way too sweet no one at the table liked it at all the only one who cared for it was the trash can which is where it ended up what a waste
1,i am sure that to someone that has never tasted real new england clam chowder this might taste good but there is no way this tastes anything like the chowder that we make in boston or anywhere else in new england you can call it washington clam chowder or northwest clam chowder or west coast clam chowder but not boston or new england clam chowder we would never put celery or garlic or thyme in our chowder
1,i was very disappointed with this recipe i agree with tilda it was dry and had no flavor i was expecting an orangey tasting cake and could taste no orange i made this for my grandson age and he did not care for it at all he loves everything i make for him and is so easy to please but this did not please had to throw it away
1,followed recipe oven temp needs adjusted turned out to be a peach mush
1,these pancakes were so terrible they had absolutely no flavor even with me adding vanilla extract the texture was fine but they tasted like nothing
1,i made this recipe exact i had to add more milk because the batter was so thick pancakes tasted better than boxed but not better than a restaurant i will not make this recipe again
1,worst pancakes i have ever had the misfortune to eat even my and yo spat them out
1,tried this the last time it was posted did not like delete recipe
1,these pancakes are the worst my siblings and i saw all signs that they were cooked we took them off waited for them to cool and they were completely raw in the center and it took me an hour to make they said minutes and to top it all off they werent even fluffy i am severely disappointed and will never try these again
1,the pancakes were fluffy but the after taste of the baking powder was awful it ruined the pancakes
1,tastes ok but is very messy and crumblywould not make again
1,too sweet for my taste and not as good as i thought they would bevery disapointedwill not make again
1,followed the directions but the bars came out dry on the edges and raw in the middle the frosting came out really runny i even added more powdered sugar and it didnt help after reading the other reviews i might try it again but cut the whole recipe in so if it doesnt work out i wont be throwing away as much food and money i did this time ill probably lower the temp to and let it bake a few more minutes
1,for all the work this recipe takes it is so not worth it i had to dump it all back into a big skillet and add spaghetti sauce and spices to give it flavor so i didnt have to eat the bland original definitely not worth it
1,very dry too much spaghetti not much flavor wouldnt make this again ill stick with my regular spaghetti recipe not work the effort
1,cant wait to try
1,possibly if this soup was renamed as a bean soup it would be more fitting this soup in no way is a white chili soup very dissapointing
1,even using only can of green chilies it was much too hot for us did not like at all
1,so very disappointed the cake sunk in the middle and had a crusty looking lighter color brown in the middle i usually use a hand mixer on a low setting but this recipe said combine therefore i used a whisk until all was combined i needed this for our easter dinner now i need to go to the supermarket to buy a cake i will cut it in pieces later to see if it tastes any good i cant serve it as is i am not too sure if i should even bother making the icing this turned out to be an expensive cake re the guinness beer that no one will drink
1,i seriously do not know how this recipe got stars i picked it bc of its high rating this is quite possibly one of the most awful banana bread recipes i have ever tried it was dry crusty tasted like cardboardi do not know how its possible to make banana bread not even taste like banana bread but this recipe managed to make that happen
1,too much wet mixture bread comes out soggy
1,took an hour and a half to set properly too wet of a mixture tastes ok though
1,so disappointed lots of work beautiful resultsvery bland in taste
1,followed the recipe exact refrigerated this overnight and when i cut in to it the next morning to serve with coffee it literally ran the inside never set and it turned out soupy not at all what i had expected and i can tell you that it was a complete waste of ingredients threw it in the garbage and i will not waste the time or ingredients again especially with the cost of pecans
1,well now i have made it and it only gets star it really doesnt deserve a star at allvery disappointed followed the recipe to the t refrigerated over night cut into it today and its nothing but a runny mess i still tastes okay but i will from now own stick to my karo syrup half light and half dark pecan pie recipe that always comes out perfect mike
1,why is the batter runny made it just like it says room temp eggs soft cream cheese is it not enough sugar added the half cup like recipe says
1,you did not include cream cheese in the ingredients recipe fails
1,you can not see all the ingredients needed for this recipe on a phone not sure about a computer since i dont have ones
1,turned out great use extra shrimp a little more butter little less lemon and added bread crumbs to sauce before i added the shrimp i did not broil
1,this turned out great i forgot to click on the rating stars i would have given this recipe stars
1,im sorry but you lost me at chicken bouillon granulesreally you won a contest
1,this was awful my husband loves meatloaf so i thought i would give this recipe a go i couldnt finish my meal amp he proceeded to throw away the leftovers thanks for the waste
1,awful to sweet
1,i dont know what all the ravening is about this cake was not good at all made it yesterday i didnt think it was moist in fact it was a little dry and didnt have a taste i will not make it again
1,my pie did not turn out as expected was very disappointed ive gone over the recipe many times as i was sure it was something i did wrong but i just cant figure out what it was i made of these pies for christmas and had to throw them both away i read the reviews and the caramel sauce is supposed to sink to the bottom but how does sauce with eggs in it sink it turned out like terrible caramel scrambled eggs on top ive baked before and really cant figure out how everyone else can make it come out right but mine was so terrible we couldnt eat it
1,this recipe was poorly written it does not state what temperature the oven should be at or that the whites need to be beaten until stiff white peaks form that information can only be found in the video which does not seem to be as easily accessible
1,i have no idea how these won first place
1,i have made porcupine meatballs many times in my life but decided to look for something different i followed this recipe exactly and my husband and i found it almost inedible this was very disappointing
1,i made this and followed the instructions as directed but the rice did not cook all the way i had to throw it all away perhaps switching to instant rice would solve e this problem
1,didnt like it
1,this was a disaster for me the jello turned into little balls when i whisked in the yogurt the only thing i can think of is that the yogurt was too cold and caused the jello to start to set maybe it would have worked if i had allowed the yogurt to warm up a bit first i had to throw it away
1,this cake was horribly dry and the worst cake ive ever made im known for making great cakes and i am so glad i didnt have to take it somewhere i felt terrible that i had to throw it away and i followed the recipe exactly
1,i usually love potato soup but my husband who loves this recipe made this for us twice and both times i thought it tasted just awful im not sure if it was the processed cheese or if the potatoes were just too starchyi know he would give this a star rating but i guess not everyone has the same tastebuds
1,i had to bake for minutes longer than the directions and still it was not fully cooked this recipe is the worst gluten free banana bread recipe i have ever cooked i have made so many different gluten free recipies and they were all pretty much fantastic i didnt relize it was possible to be this heavy gooey mess
1,not certain what others have done that i have not but this was the most useless recipe i have ever utilized too thick burns on top and sides and raw in the middle i even tried adding more applesauce so it would not be like cooking wallpaper paste in the trash it went and going back to my old recipe
1,lil cheddar meat loavesskip the sickeningly sweet topping the mini loaf idea was very good but will use my own meatloaf recipe which has alot more flavor
1,lil cheddar meat loaves skip the sickeningly sweet topping the mini loaf idea was very good but will use my own meatloaf recipe which has alot more flavor
1,blandi think jimmy dean original sausage would have been better probably wont cook again
1,the meat stayed very soft the oats were completely the wrong starch to add and the sauce was sickeningly sweet it couldnt even be salvaged by being made into a sandwich i cant believe so many people liked this gross just plain gross
1,this bread was terrible was hard to get out of the pan because it slightly overflowed nothing but a gooey mess waste of ingredients
1,ahhhhh how can you even call this key lime pie no key limes in itkey lime pie is not greenwhat are you thinking
1,i agree with pjmcbride a key lime pie is not green where is the key lime juice what part of this pie even comes remotely close to a true key lime pie i would never ever ever make this sad imitation
1,terrible not sweet at all not crisp generally repugnant and a waste of my time and ingredients
1,turned into melted puddles in the oven i had the sneaking feeling the egg whites should be whipped and then sugar added etc but i followed the video and written instructions to the letter and just ended up with a pile of coconut and the cookie part bled out all over the cookie sheet like a pool of water how did you guys make this recipe work im so curious because there are many positive reviews would like to know how to fix it
1,just a doubt about the egg whites are they beaten
1,this would be great if you edited to include whipping the egg whites otherwise it doesnt work at all
1,my husband loves my meatloaf but im always on the lookout for new recipes and ways to make it mine rarely turns out the same two times in a row but he always loves itseeing that this had stars i decided to try it i made it exactly as the recipe was written yes it was moist but it was the most bland tasteless meatloaf i have ever made totally a waste of good ground beef sorry but i wont be making this recipe ever again
1,i followed the recipe exactly and i ended up with a sloppy mess the loaf just fell apart also the sauce is way too sweet
1,i am sorry but this was not good at all very dry we threw what was left in the garbage followed the recipe exactly i have two other go to meatloaf recipes that i will continue to use what intrigued me was the crackers in it because mine falls apart a lot i will not make this again no flavor either i felt like i was eating dry hamburgers
1,i must have used too many apples i got dried up apple chunks instead of a cake the recipe looks so good and you all have had success what did i do wrong
1,enchiladas made with flour tortillas sacrilege
1,although i love both garlic and mexican food i thought this was terrible the tortillas were soggy and the sauce was awful
1,way too much sodium you should take in less than mg a daynot in one meal
1,i was not a fan to bland and eggy for my taste i halved the recipe since there are only two of us and im so glad i did the sauce was good but the rest of it was just blah i will not be making this one again
1,followed recipe to a tset oven to and baked for an hourchecked with toothpick methodleft in for another min as directedbread came out hard as a rockcould not cut it with any knife in my kitchenhad to use hack saw to cut itnever again
1,i always bake banana bread and its recipe is fool proofi tried this recipe last night and i am sorry to say it was not a very good one it took hours and still it was soggy so maybe if we put less buttermilk in it result might be different i like the taste of it tough nasira mansoor
1,im still waiting for my cake to finish baking its all giggly in the middle and i need it in an hour and a half for my moms birthday i may be throwing it out and buying one what went wrong
1,i am an experienced baker and this cake was less than disappointing the middle was completely raw and sank to the middle so mch so it looked like a giant crater had to throw outand start over i cooked it for so long that the edges were getting burnt dont bake this cake
1,i found this recipe very bland if i make this again i will add some italian seasoning or basil it was disappointing the way the recipe is written
1,this recipe is extremely bland definitely use more salt and other seasonings the end result was not worth the time or effort
1,this recipe should have no stars i have never heard of baking thinly sliced potatoes for an hour and a halfseemed strangebut i tried itwhat a mushy nasty mess absolutely no taste as others said bland this recipe needs to be thrown out or needs to be tweaked to the point that it is ediblei think i will stick to throwing it out
1,why do people called scalloped potatoes au gratin unfortunately i cant have cheese ive wasted so much time looking for recipes only to find they have cheese these do sound delicious for scalloped potatoes
1,this recipe has been on allrecipescom for yearsnot liking copycats
1,i followed this recipe exactly it was so blah no flavor at all i kept adding more cheese and seasonings it looked good but had no taste
1,i love it it is the best soup ever that is why i gave it one star
1,i was not a fan of this recipe i should have noticed when it called for almost all canned ingredients that it would not be too tasty basically you just throw all the ingredients together and hope for the best i had to add an extra pack of taco seasoning so that this soup could have a better taste then just canned beans and tomatoes i also added sugar because the ranch dressing adds a sour taste to the soup that i had to cover up and some chili garlic sauce to give it a kick i would suggest to omit the ranch dressing all together matter of fact throw the whole recipe away and try again
1,this soup looks really good but the sodium is over the top i wont be making this
1,this is absolutely the worst key lime pie i have ever tasted maybe its because i am a native floridian but this is terrible no one in my family would eat it and i had to throw it away i made it on a trip to st louis because i couldnt get key lime juice but it was a waste of time and money disgusting by the way key lime pie is never green if its green its not the real thing
1,so disappointed in this soup i made this exactly as the recipe read for my family the celery seed gave this a bitter awful taste so upsetting to try a new recipe spending time and money only to be so disappointed
1,i cant see a reason for adding milk to a hearty soup i hate milky soups
1,given the great reviews and high rating i had great hopes for this recipe followed it exactly and cannot figure out what all the hype is about very pedestrian no one liked it and all agreed it was missing a lot of something the chicken was very bland even though i used a very good parmesan that i grated specifically for this recipe and added some salt i season everything to the flour the bruschetta on top was just garlicky tomatoes definitely deleting this one from the recipes to try file
1,followed the recipe to a t and it turned out shall we say not so good it looked nothing like the photo which should have been my first clue when i saw what looked like an omelet under the chicken usually you do egg then flour so i dont know if this was the problem or if it was suppose to be like this too much basil and garlic for c of bread crumbs wont be trying this one anymore
1,this is the first time i used someone elses recipe and not my own that i have used for years flavor was ok but each one of my little loafs all stuck to the bottom of the pan i will be going back to my recipe sorry
1,this was a huge disappointment it does smell good so i am hoping that serving it hot with a scoop of ice cream may make it edible so it doesnt have to be dumped in the garbage i dont have extra in food budget to be throwing away food the stiffness of the batter is a cause for concern i am going to try to save this mess and will never make it again
1,i followed this recipe exact except i substituted splenda for sugar the recipe said the batter would be stiff and i could have rolled it out like pie crust i added milk to make the batter that i could put in a cake pan and spread out it had plenty of apples and the butterscotch sauce made it taste wonderful did not look good but tasted great will not make this again
1,this was totally gross all i could taste was salt and i love salt will go back to my original receipe wanted to try something new and wish i hadnt
1,followed recipe exactly and casserole did not rise daughter made it a few weeks ago and had same results perhaps a x baking dish is too large
1,the worst meatloaf ive ever tasted i followed recipe to the tyak
1,clicking on one star just so that toh can correct something in the comment by the submitter of this recipe as a resident of wisconsin the correct spelling of the town betty lives in should end with an o thus shawano
1,too eggy egg runs to center of pan solutiononly use unfrozen coconutremove egg add a bit of condensed milk
1,i definitely dont recommend this recipe without some serious tweaking the ratio of potatoesbacon to sour creamcheese is ridiculous this might be good if you doubled the potatoes and halved the dairy or added a ton of other ingredients to cut down on the richness but otherwise its nearly inedible i made it entirely as directed total bust
1,i thought that the batter was deliciouse but the final product had a flour taste that was not very good the frosting was also disappointing
1,does taste of home not publish negative reviews this cake was a disaster for me today i used inch pans and the cake came out over the top and spilled into the oven i followed the recipe to the letter but i think it should have been baked at degrees rather than and perhaps part of the batter should have been used for cupcakes as described if one used the inch pans too much batter for inch pans
1,this was the worst meat loaf there was no taste and it was too runny will never make again
1,i agree with randall i made it today and followed recipe exactly as said sorry but this is the worst meatloaf i ever made i landed up giving it to my cats
1,i read all of these reviews and finally i found one that had the same issues i can not believe no one had issues i used pans the dough over flowed and created a huge mess the pans were greased floured and cooled and the cake stuck to the pans the cake was moist maybe to moist the cooking time was way off i cooked it for an hour and yes my ovens temp is correct the icinghad an after taste of flour and i still had grit from the sugar after doing patch work on the cake i salvaged it to a degree no i would not recommend this cake to anyone it was a disaster
1,i really didnt care for this soup at all sorry to say it was a throw away a waste of time ive enjoyed others better
1,very good has anyone ever tried freezing this recipe
1,really bland looked super delicious in the pic i would say skip the almond extract and use cinnamon in its place and instead of the mixture on top us a cobblercake crumble instead i think that would do the trick nobody in my family of liked it and im the only one that is picky so thats pretty bad
1,so bad the corn starch makes it extremely gluey and gross and is completely unnecessary all you need is the butter chopped into the flour to make the crisp topping work this tastes like something from dennys thats not a compliment
1,for anyone who thinks this recipe looks good dont be deceived for me it looks like vomit and it tastes the same even substituting real cheese for that velveeta plastic cheese im sorry if i sound like a snob but velveeta is for those who have no idea what real cheese
1,i dont mean any insult but hamburgers do not have potatoes in them there is a much better recipe on food network from diners driveins and dives sorry
1,this recipes was way too salty
1,we did not like this at all the chili powder was too overwhelming and i think taco seasoning would be a much better choice
1,my husband and i didnt like this recipe it had an aftertaste that was unpleasant i think from the italian dressing
1,do not bake this in an x pan as directed my bread has been in the oven hour and minutes and its still goo in the middle im very disappointed because the batter was delicious and ive used lemons and a ounce container of blueberries what a waste
1,looks terrible calorific and basically junk food please learn how to cook
1,unfortunately i felt like this recipe had very little taste i wont be making it again
1,my kids liked this but my wife and i thought it was gross too rich and creamy for my liking it was also too pastey i tend to like my mac and cheese a little milkier than this and not nearly as thick sorry but i wont be making it again
1,so very disappointed with this recipe it was terrible i made this for a special occasion and it was like eating from the sugar bowl yuk i find it hard to believe this was a winning recipe
1,my family didnt like this i think the mustard counted against the flavor they asked me not to make it again
1,heavy really awful
1,this recipe is excellent very easy i have made these at least six times the muffins are very moist and delicious i added a fourth cup of chopped walnuts and a fourth cup of mini chocolate chips for a variation i also added tsp of cinnamon
1,i followed this recipe exactly and would never made this dish again everyone who tried it thought it was missing something and i agreed maybe green peppers or ground mustard
1,made this pie for thanksgiving dinner i should have read the reviews i have made many pies this was the absolute worst i have ever produced i used my normal crust recipe with this one for the filling like the others my crust looked beautiful but when we cut into the pie it was a mess of undercooked apples with a ton of runny juice it never set up this recipe needs to be removed it definitely does not work the way its published you guys should be ashamed of it readers should not have to tweak your recipe in order to make it work remove please
1,recipe sucks there was a lot of liquid in the bottom of the pie even with a lattice top
1,this was unfortunately horribly under seasoned i ended up adding more soy sauce five spice seasoning garlic salt more soy sauceyou get the idea i really wanted to like it amp its a decent starting place for veggiesnoodles but seasoningwise i would not recommend
1,tasteless
1,if i am allergic to soy is there something i could substitute for it id really like to try it
1,followed the recipe to the letter pie looked great on the outside but was a soupy mess on the inside i will not make this again and i do not recommend it
1,despite cutting back on the amount of added sugar i found this cake to be too sweet and unnaturally pink it had an overwhelming artificial flavor it is difficult to keep the frosting from becoming runny no matter how well drained the strawberries are
2,this pie was a soupy mess i even followed the advice of another reviewer and reduced the juices and sugars of the apples before assembling the pie also the apples were very thinly sliced and did not cook through after minutes of baking when the crust was done the flavors were very good but the way it baked up was unacceptable especially for so much work id be less disappointed if i had used a store bought crust and saved the time and effort will not make this again
2,im mystified by all of these reviews i made this tonight and it was dry and bland no one liked it at all will not be making it again
2,really needed more sauce i added half a jar of orange sauce to it otherwise it would have been very bland will probably not make again
2,dont use granny smith apples pie came out perfectly except grannys make it sour
2,made this for christmas and nobody liked it i thought it was okay but nothing special enough to make again this is not going in my recipe book needless to say
2,sauce is very thick looking for something more creamy
2,just didnt care for
2,i was excited to try this recipe followed it to the letter bread didnt rise properly the sides and bottom were burned and the middle was still mush i greased my pans really heavily so it would not stick still stuck im only giving this stars because it was an easy recipe what a waste of ingredients we couldnt even eat it
2,was just ok for us we felt like it was missing flavor just needed something probably wont make again
2,needs a thickening agent i let this pie sit for over a day and a half and it was still way too runny had a decent taste but the cinnamon and nutmeg was a bit over powering
2,first off pie didnt taste bad however all this talk of grandmas special apple pie is disingenuous at best the pie came out with a lot of liquid i like a nice wholesome and crispy apple pie not a wet apple pie this pie is grandmas wap wet a pie
2,mine came out super liquidity and my apples were still crunchy i have to bake it again the flavor was okay
2,you should use milk not egg white to brush on the pie crust pie crust edges do not need to be covered with foil until the end if theyre browning too quickly time given is not long enough to cook the filling it needs twice as long as stated here it also needs a higher starting temperature it should be baked at degrees for the first minutes then turned down to degrees to bake for a further minutes or so also i used bramley apples and it came out a bit tart so id increase the sugar and also the flour and it is liquidy
2,it was okay but to sweet for my taste
2,i made this but may have made a mistake doubling the recipe to accommodate my bounty of overripe bananas i thought my pans were the right size but one of the loaves ran over in the oven and even though i greased the already nonstick pans i couldnt get either loaf out of the pan intact having said that the flavor was good and i will try the recipe again and readjust my star level
2,the texture was soggy the taste was bland the sauce only added more sweet to a really sweet cake and then throw in the fat and butter and there was nothing to find tasty
2,we did not care for this recipe at all we found it to bland
2,i was really looking forward to this chili but was sadly disappointed i used ground turkey because thats what i had on hand but the flavor just wasnt what i was expecting at all i might try it again and leave out the oregano that just doesnt say chili to me based on all the good reviews i really thought i would love it but didnt
2,i thought i would love it but it was too soupy and spicy with no pumpkin taste if i were to make it again i would another can of pumpkin one less can of tomato and one less cup of broth i would use ground turkey and no oregano
2,the flavor was good but i did find it a little too moist and left me feeling like it was too oily
2,these were too sweet for me
2,my wife and i made this just by the recipe and it was nasty thought we had made a mistake so we did it again this is the worse tasting meat loafs i have ever tasted ill never make it again
2,my husband and i were looking for a good potato recipe and we stumbled upon this one initially our first thought was it makes too much for our little family of two so we decided to cut the recipe in half it sounded deliciousonce it came out of the oven that was a different story the amount of bacon coupled with the sour cream overpowers the dish so the balance of flavors is too rich because the potatoes are such a neutral flavor they get lost in the casserole maybe if you use less of the sour cream and bacon or more potatoes that would be the right ratio of bacon to toppings also the presentation wasnt very appealing because the whiteness of the sour cream dominates the other colorssadly this recipe will not be added to our recipe box happy cooking
2,what a disappointment this dish was i love potatoes and could not wait to try this too much sour cream and cheese for our tastes wish i had only made half the recipe to try it you cant even taste the potatoes that well made as directed except for the green onions omitted them wont be making this one again
2,baking time way off im at minutes and still gooey in the middle
2,this cake was moist ill give it that but as far as taste goes the flavor was very lacking i tasted almost no chocolate and that was after i added more cocoa than it called for i would not make this again to me a chocolate cake should taste more chocolatey than this cake did
2,too bland for my taste even though i dont like spicy foods either i had a lot left over amp if i had served it again intended to add a can of crushed tomatoes instead after a few days in the frig i just threw it out it needed something just not sure what
2,didnt make this recipe the high fat content of the ingredients scared me away bacon types of cheese and sour cream im sure its yummy but not so good for you
2,it wasnt that good
2,this is the second time ive tried to make this cake and it just falls apart this time i put it in for almost mins longer and still completely fell apart it tastes great ill give it that my mil swears by this cake but im starting to wonder if she actually makes another one its really frustrating bc now im cakeless for my sons birthday after the same for fathers day i bake and decorate cakes as a hobby but have never had this experience before maybe cutting the coffee or another liquid in half would work better or a higher temp idk either way i probably wont be trying again with this recipe
2,i think this is a good starting point but it didnt have much flavor and we wont be making this again
2,it just tasted funny to me
2,way too much water
2,this dessert is definitely simple but it tastes exactly like what it is just yogurt and coolwhip sweetened with jello mix
2,so sorry i have to disagree with a lot of stellar reviews here the taste of velveeta is so overwhelming i will however try again with cheddar
2,this recipe was very easy and looks good i only changed one thing and that was just using half the salt which happens to be way too much also you should add salt last the cheese can have lots of salt and the butter too it is ruined and will go in the trash and i hate wasting food sad sad
2,very tastybut next time i will double the sauce to make it creamier i also added tsp of thyme to give it extra flavor
2,unmitigated disaster followed this recipe to the letter the potatoes were still hard and the sauce curdly and soupy i put it back in the oven and it took nearly another hour for the potatoes to soften i had to finish the serving in the microwave the sauce just did not hold up i have no idea why but i am going with a different ratio of ingredients next time
2,do not add the water in the first step it renders the meatballs to a fluid and they fall apart during browning
2,i dont know what i did wrong but these did not turn out very well used sweetened flaked coconut instead of the shredded and extra large egg whites because thats what i had on hand they spread out bottom of cookie on the baking sheet and were impossible to get off the greased baking sheet maybe too much egg white anyone else have this problem good taste though
2,too sweet would just use a little ketchup and not add brown sugar or add very little
2,i thought these bars were very heavy i dont think i will make again
2,although i am sure that some people would like thisit is not traditional in any sense of the word it is fusion cooking this is texmex cuisine which obviously has been tweaked from traditional mexican food made to please those north of the border here in texas people put beef in just about everything we always use cheese in our rellenos and enchiladastraditional enchiladas are made with corn tortillas as the author notedthe sauce recipe here is very much the same as canned sauce in that both use tomato products i can tell you with authority that most restaurants and mexican homes such as ours never use tomato products in our enchilada sauce california northern and central mexico dont use tomatoes in this way traditionallyas we live in texas i encounter all sorts of deviations from traditional mexican food some are ok but hubby will not eat enchiladas anywhere but at home due to the fact he is always disappointed in their preparation the same is true with many mexican families herefor my enchilada sauce i only use diced onion cooked in oil until transparent then i add the flour and spices to create a roux and cook for at least minutes i then add the broth better than bouillon chicken and simmer for minutes i dont add salt as there is enough in the broth my spice mixture is secret and handed down so i will not offer it here
2,it was just ok
2,i was eager to try this from the great reviews but did not care for this at all the major seasonings are chili powder and cumin which give the enchilada sauce on the top an odd flavor and sauce is very thick this ended up being just a pile of mush when you take it out of the oven and not enchilada flavor at all
2,i halved the recipe and it was more than enough for people i also chose to beat the cream cheese with the liquid before adding as opposed to doing the cubes and i added both a little sugar and pure real vanilla however i agree with some other remarks that it was too eggy i could taste the egg more than the other ingredients and the texture was very dense instead of eggs again i halved next time i would do but keep everything else the same sauce is good but very sweet a little goes a long way i will definitely make it again just change the eggs to help the texture be more like french toast than an egg casserole id give it higher stars if it wasnt for the eggs
2,either something went terribly wrong could be my fault or it was not to anyones liking
2,heres another one that i followed the directions right down to the letter first of all it was to eggy for me so id strongly suggest that you not use a dozen of eggs that this calls for thats just way to much egg the ladys at church liked it but i cant believe this is a grand prize winner i wont be making this again i was so disappointed one lady at church had to actually spit it out of her mouth she said sorry but theres way to many textures going on with this i did really like the homemade blueberry syrup however i would rank the syrup only a but not the casserole i find it surprising that so many of yall like this so well
2,this was very bland and didnt have enought cream cheese would not make it again
2,very easy directions and a simple pie but the pie was a little too eggy for me it wasnt very appealing when i sliced it the pie looked more like scrambled egg than a cheesecake mixture
2,just ok i made the recipe exactly as published had very little sea food flavor noticed many of the positive reviews were from people who addeddoubled the clams hard to rate higher if modifications have to be made to make it taste good also it never thickened properly which is ok if you prefer thinner canned soup consistency
2,i followed the directions no adding or subtracting and this is the most tasteless chowder ive had looking through other recipes now to see what i can do to doctor it up will give it stars for creaminess but so bland
2,the taste was pretty good but the texture and final look didnt at all match the picture theres not enough coconut in this recipe relative to the egg whites it turned into a puddle of mess when baking
2,they taste great but i dont understand how to get the perfect shape so i just the whole batter into the pan
2,as a rule we love porcupine meatballs just not this recipe the cup of water with the beef makes them ridiculously soggy and they dont hold their shape while browning and end up as mush
2,we wanted to try this based on all of the good reviews but we did not like it little flavor and a lot of work
2,i like this recipe better
2,super easy cake to make but the frosting was too runny to create froth enjoyed the cake very much the first day but really dried out in the fridge overnight and i had it wrapped in plastic wrap disappointing overall
2,cake was not very exciting i had hoped that the guinness would make it unique and interesting but it was really not at all noticeable
2,there is no reason to add flour to potato soup it will give the soup an artificial starchy taste simply use an immersion blender and puree the the soup when the potatoes are cooked and use real cheese
2,i made this therefore i would not recommend then i made it my way instead of flour i added an extra cup of potatoes then after boiling potatoes in chicken broth removed a cup of potatoes and mashed them returned to pot added a little cream and had a deliciously thickened soup oh and i never use cheese its not needed if you season your potatoes properly
2,i always make mine in a crockpot i thought last minute i wanted this and gave it a try sorry was not happy it looked odd to not have an egg to hold together but i gave it a shot
2,i was so disappointed the long grain rice did not get cooked inside of the meatballs even after an hour my family tried to eat them but no one was able to finish or enjoy them since the texture was crunchy rice i did not see one other comment with the same problem what did i do wrong
2,pthis recipe was not terrible however i do not care to make it again the family did not care for the recipe eitherp
2,this recipe was not terrible however i do not care to make it again the family did not care for the recipe either
2,the only reason i gave this stars is because the flavor of the sherry over powered the other tasty ingredients i feel as though using the chicken broth would have been a better choice for me will be trying again
2,i am a very seasoned cook make everything from scratch made just as written cake sunk in middle and icing is like soup
2,i made this for st patricks day it is a moist cake but doesnt taste chocolatey at all it tastes like beer the frosting was quite runny so i added additional powdered sugar trying to thicken it up some but it didnt work it stayed runny even after refrigerating it tasted good though i poured it over the cake my husband liked it but he loves beer
2,horrible recipe the sauce was a stark white tasteless paste that no amount of doctoring after the fact could resolve a total waste of ingredients and home made pie crust a much better option is to make your chicken stock or use storebought stock and thicken it using tbsp cornstarch mixed with cup cold water and simmer until it thickens before adding the chicken and vegetables that way you still have chicken gravy not flour gravy
2,meh i agree with another user that this recipe is quite bland not very sweet when you bite into the bars there is a beautifully creamy fluffy texture but not much flavor the crust is the best part i think tastes like shortbread cookies the custard section seems to be missing something this recipes was really a lot of work i do not plan to make these again
2,i made this recipe after reading all the great reviews i was very disappointed in these bars all the butter and whipping cream overpowered the rhubarb there is way too much crust for this recipe half the amount would be much better also since these bars have to be stored in the fridge the chilled crust ended up being hard would not make these again ill save my rhubarb for recipes where the rhubarb can really shine
2,havent made these due to the huge amount of cream in both filling and frosting has anyone made them with half and half in the filling
2,i cant quite figure out what all the excitement is about this recipe it was just okay i would prefer meatballs without rice anyday and the sauce wasnt great i would far prefer spaghetti sauce or sweet and sour or mushroom or just about anything else wont make this again but glad i tried it
2,sounded good but sorry didnt care for it
2,not sure what everyone was so impressed with i made these and they were really dry maybe i just didnt add enough zucchini but still i had to smother my cupcake in creamcheese frosting to eat it to be fair i did not try the caramel frosting
2,the basics are okay but if you follow the exact directions the batter is much too thick adding additional milk is necessary
2,this wasnt terrible but wasnt good it is greatly lacking in flavor i would add more celery carrots parsley onion salt and pepper it needs a lot of help stars
2,the order of the recipe didnt make sense and would be more difficult for a novice cook to follow than it should i would melt butter then add veggies and flour to cook add broth and allow to simmer it definitely needs salt and pepper and maybe something else cups of wild rice is too much try cups omit the wine just use broth this recipe just needed to be simplified and add some salt and its good i made all those changes and its much better
2,first time i didnt have correct size pan and they turned out well second time i used correct size pan and there wasnt enough carmel to cover i gave the recipe to others and they both failed and dumped it flavor was good but did not turn out as expected
2,stars still arent working right all are blackid give it a one star although hubby said he liked it wont make it again was dry prefer my shrimp stirfried or coconut covered
2,more like a flat sheet cake should have made cupcakes with frosting instead not bar like at all i did know better to add some spices otherwise it would have been a bland even though i added large bananas i also used cup brown sugar in hopes it would add more depth no chance back to the family cookbook for me
2,im pretty disappointed with this recipe ive made this in the past and it always turned out great this recipe changed things up a bit from what im used to and i figured it would be interesting to try something new the strawberries in syrup was a bad choice mixing them with the jello just made it way too watery i was supposed to bring it to work today for a potluck but instead its still sitting in my fridge because the jello layer is still soup next time either do regular frozen berries or fresh skip the syrup also i agree with some reviewers that the cream cheese layer is too thin definitely browse around to find other variations of this recipe before moving forward
2,i remembered making a similar recipe years ago that was delicious but this wasnt it the gelatin layer wouldnt set it was just too watery probably because of the syrup on the frozen sweetened strawberries the pretzel crust was not crunchy and was total mush on day i was careful not to make any deviation from the recipe and even made it a second time which did not turn out any better i made this to take to a ladies tea at church and was quite disappointed
2,to much flour not enough cornmeal
2,we just didnt care for the taste with the cream of mushroom soup it was just weird way to much work for something thats edible but not worth making agian
2,we found this to be bland and rather dry especially with next day leftovers its a time consuming recipe but its just okay tasting and not worth the effort as is i added garlic cloves and some salt and pepper to the hamburger while cooking it but that extra seasoning didnt go far enough to make this have real flavor if you like plain food then youd like this but if i were to make it again i would use spaghetti sauce rather than diced tomatoes for sure the casserole doesnt really have any sauce to it and the shredded cheese disappears when you bake the casserole leaving you with layers of dry spaghetti noodles with some bits of diced tomato there are other spaghetti casserole recipes i would try here before this one its really not that good
2,sorry but the lady who said its not new england is absolutely right half the ingredients in this recipe do not belong in a true ne clam chowder thyme chicken broth garlic bacon half
2,tasty but otherwise a flop top layer separated from caramel by the time i sawed thru the caramel the nougat layer was smashed am an experienced cook but these bars made me look like a beginner i would love to hear if anyone was able to cut these neatly enough to put on a serving tray if someone didadd details to the recipe as it stands i will never waste the time and money on this recipe again
2,we have tried them twice now and dont like them
2,i followed this recipe exactly as it said and the batter came out more like crepe batter i had to add some extra flour to thicken it up still cooking so i have yet to taste
2,is there such thing as too fluffy of a pancake the batter was extremely fluffy to the point i that they would not completely cook through on the stove top and had to be finished in the oven which resulted in a flat heavy pancake once completely cooked through
2,the horseradish was not a great compliment to these sandwiches at all all the star ratings fooled me the horseradish taste like how it sound it has a very strong taste and is spicy i would make this again with all the other ingredients i highly recommend finding an alternative to the horseradish
2,all i could taste was horseradish i followed the directions to the letter i might try again without the horseradish because they smelled so good otherwise and i think they could be without it
2,did anyone else even come close to using cups of flour i used met before and it came out perfectly
2,this isnt cornbreadmore like cake but then im from the south
2,i used half the sugar so it wasnt overly sweet for me but its corn meal white flour ratio is off i think it tasted more like a yellow cake than corn bread to me not great as a corn bread
2,tastes too much like cake and not cornbread has a good flavor but if you are looking for cornbread this doesnt really do the trick
2,not a fan of this cake was quite dense and tasted like dark chocolate with all brown sugar and cocoa the frosting was excellent
2,high hopes with so many great reviews unfortunately this is way too sweet on the bright side the kids love the sugar rush and candy bar like sweetness so stars for that cool whip and cup of sugar with the cream cheese then jello and the sweet syrup strawberries next time ill find another version of this with a lot less sugar and using heavy whipping cream
2,ive enjoyed this dessert before and wanted to try to make it myself i think the numbers here are a bit off as recommended in the comments i used a larger dish there is a problem with the amount of pretzels used the cream cheese layer is delicious and super sweet and very very thin and would be just very thin in the smaller pan it would also make a good dip for fresh berries speaking of berries ounces of frozen strawberries i think that might be a mistake too im not pleased with this outcome and hope i have time to shop and redo it before the picnic tomorrow
2,will not be making this again coming from new england this is definitely not new england clam chowder
2,this makes a good chowder base but using canned clams and bottled juice leaves little clam flavor use fresh salty clams and you can skip the boullion
2,as a working cook for over years i was dubious about the idea of adding a flour slurry so late in the cooking process regrettably i was correct the flavor was overwhelmed by raw flouri would suggest making the rue thats what it is in the pot before adding the liquidsyou do that and leave out most if not all of the halfhalf then you will come closer to a perfect chowderother than those issues the flavor profile was on point i look forward to trying this again while trusting in my instincts
2,this has way too much lemon i havent tried it with reduced or zero lemon juice but i think it would probably be pretty bland it needs more garlic and something to give it a little zing granted though it was a very easy experiment
2,this recipe is to simplistic and not detailed enough by not letting the yeast sit i believe it caused the bread not to rise high enough this resulted in loafs that were shorter than they shouldve been i also reccomend a egg wash before cooking the texture of the bread was sorta like cornbread and a little mushy but not to bad really not great or terrible it was very crumbly and hard to cut thin slices
2,didnt like the taste was kinda blaw
2,i made these to take to visit a sick family member and was pretty disappointed by the lack of flavor in the bars themselves they definitely need spices other then just cinnamon and i regretted not adding ground cloves ginger and nutmeg but i wanted to make the recipe exactly as shown the frosting was good but was the only flavor you could taste
2,followed recipe as written not enough pumpkin flavor more like cake than bars probably wont make again
2,ive been making cheeseburger chowder for years my recipe is betterbut nice attempt lol velveeta
2,we arent super fans of velveeta so it wasnt our favorite recipe fun to try though
2,i used brown sugar and reduced it to cup based on other peoples reviews i used frozen thighs and they took hours to cook i have a baked chicken recipe that i like better and will use in the future
2,we did not enjoy this casserole my family all agreed that our alltime favorite egg casserole by jimmy dean is much better
2,my cake turned out heavy and didnt rise i loved the frosting but i obviously did something wrong as it was not fluffy but more solid like the texture of clay
2,recipe ingredient list does not include amount of chicken how many breasts
2,i have hard time calling this the best ever it took min longer than estimated to bake and the top was all crusty and dark because of the high amount of sugar i also made a batch of the basic banana bread muffins and preferred that recipe a lot more
2,i made these and they turned out way to sugary and not moist at all why two cups of sugar when you have the natural sweetness of the bananas really disappointed
2,i cant believe all of the five star ratings for this cake it was very bland and boring the picture looked so pretty and the recipe sounded great so i tried it we ended up throwing out the whole cake minus two piecesmaybe it was the jiffy cake mix which i thought had a strange taste i dont know it may have been better if the pineapple was in the actual cake too who knows but it definitely needed something else
2,i love chicken noodle soup and was anxious to try this recipie i should not have added the sour cream i could not eat the soup because adding the the sour cream made it sour tasting i love sour cream but not in soup
2,we did not like the pretzel crust way too salty for a desert
2,these instructions are not clear for a first time baker
2,my rating has to do with the equipment used this is supposedly a recipe is for beginners how many beginners have a dough mixer instructions for making the bread truly by hand would be wonderful
2,my family and i were not a fan of this recipe it was so thick with all the flour and we couldnt taste anything but thyme it was a bit salty as well the seasonings were just overpowering i think this would better suit my families tastes if the seasonings and flour were cut in half
2,very disappointed they are dry amp i only baked them minutes amp they do not have a lot of pumpkin flavor need something added to them maybe nuts amp more pumpkin flavor amp more spices will not make them again
2,i substituted applesauce for the oil and it turned out way too moist the toothpick came out clean but the bars actually had a gummy texture i should try the recipe again as the original recipe reads but honestly i dont like any recipe with that much oil i also tried chocolate chips sprinkled on top of half of the bars a jelly roll pan makes a lot of bars so i wanted to try them different way it was a bad idea the bars did not have that choc chip pumpkin muffin sense at all i do agree with many others that the recipe was super easy to put together at least i have something good to add
2,this recipe looks exactly like the one on foodnetworkcom for paula deens pumpkin bars
2,i mix spice cake mix with large can pumpkin and egg get the same results so quick and easy pour into a buttered x pan follow baking directions for the cake
2,too salty for us but id love to find a similar recipe with less salt
2,this recipe needs fruit to add to taste and eye appeal
2,i cooked the sugar and milk minutes and it was too dry after cooling the taste was ok
2,i found this soup so bland and runny i even used pepper jack instead of cheddar i dont understand what all the raves were about not yummy just boring
2,not a fan too salty and the gravy overpowered the taste of the veggies i wish i had found another cauliflower recipe
2,with the high amount of sugar required the bread would be like store bought bananas are quite sweet on their own i used c brown sugar and the bread was amazing
2,ill give stars for flavour but no way do these cookies deserve a high rating i followed the recipe exactlythe two inches apart should be been the dough is way too soft and just runs into a big mass of a dough sheet i reviewed the recipe because i thought i had made an error but no sorry but there are much better recipes out there for soft molassses and ginger cookies
2,additional sugar raw is not an ingredient one can act on recipe does not say how much sugar and the multiple adds for print recipes is so annoying by accident i clicked on it and then had to spend time to take it out i just signed up for this site as i saw the recipe on my flipboard page but due to the navigation around ad challenges and inability to get accurate recipe ingredients i am seriously considering deleting my account frustration is not a customer service plus
2,followed the recipe resulting dough was too slimy and runny added cup more flour to thicken the dough helped to shape them and get them on the baking sheet cooked for minutes on as directed when i took them out of the oven of them had burned on the bottom they also look nothing like the picture at least the part of the cookies that were not burned taste good i guess
2,i just made these following the recipe exactly and they came out very thin not at all like the picture maybe refrigerate the dough next time
2,i didnt really care for this but i am also not a big tomato sauce fan it certainly didnt live up to its hype i used half ground beef and half sausage with cheese ravioli i might try it again with extra cheeses and spices but then again i might not bother
2,ok it looks white and tastes good but i dont like the inside at all i hate it nasty nasty white cake ever
2,as is only a because there is no tasteflavor i may make this again with these changes id put the pineapple juice in the cake in place of the water i may tried putting a nd can of pineapple in the cake to for more flavor if that doesnt do it then i could try the trifle as others suggested this is something that feels light after a meal
2,i made this right after i got the recipe and my family loved it i will definitely make it again lf from wa
2,it was okay i agree with some users the ingredients arent proportional it was way to moist wet almost unfortunate as it is a waste of ingredients
2,this was not one of my favorite cakes
2,this was not one of my favorite cake recipes
2,my cake didnt rise isnt baking soda needed for helping to rise i didnt see that in the receipe
2,doubled this recipe to make loaves i cooked for minutes took out of oven and began to cool it realized that it was not done and put back into the oven baked for another minutes and took out still did not seem done followed the recipe to a t do not know what happened maybe too much oil any suggestions will not make again
2,i made this added fresh spinach green pepper and mushrooms used a swissgruyere cheese combo and some cheddar it still was very bland and i think that was due to the potatoes which really need to be cooked first in order to have any flavor otherwise the potatoes just overpower everything else in it
2,the flavor combination wasnt our favorite
2,we did not like this at all it was too salty from all the packaged mixes i will not be making this again
2,the result is exactly like a baconflavored block of cheese can not recommend
2,i was hoping that this recipe would be a real winner being that it got previous rave reviews but i was very disappointed this cake lacked in flavor and sweetness and was too dense the only saving grace was the frosting but then we decided that it still wasnt worth it so it went into the trash back to the drawing board
2,this fudge was dry
2,as i was making the soup i was wondering why there was no garlic or onion looking at the spices i only see salt and pepper i just knew this soup was going to be bland and i dont want to make something and it not be great i melted the butter and added garlic and onion i also added crumbled bacon and cubed ham i used red pepper flakes instead of the hot sauce i also thicken the soup more to get a more like a chowder consistensy i chopped in some fresh parsley just before serving after my changes i loved it
2,followed recipe to a tee broth was very very thin i used the chicken broth to boil veggies might add some corn now when i added broth
2,the recipe was blend so i ate dried herbs more salt onion and garlic powder after doing that it was amazing
2,tasted okay my family liked but next time no thyme
2,great cheesecake but unfortunately and im surprised no one else has mentioned it this recipe yields enough cheesecake filling to easily do two cakes wish i had known beforehand as i just kept saying to myself the recipe has to be right as i kept noticing that there seemed to be way too much while i was mixing the ingredients and i wound up washing of the filling down the sink and over filling the one pan amp crust i did have and the cheesecake ballooned up and split in several deep crevices because of this get your amounts correct next time please
2,tastes like eating melted plastic thanks to the velveeta next time i would use real cheddar and it might edible then
2,my whole family was very disappointed with this soup we were expecting something amazing and it was just mediocre to us
2,i was disappointed easy to make but very bland even with hot sauce i added bacon and still no flavor
2,this macaroni salad was ok but ive had better flavor was a bit bland for me
2,would be better without the cotton cheese and the provolone in my opinion and more spices
2,made exactly as set out in recipe except added one teaspoon of cinnamon to filling prep was easy and straight forward enjoyed the pie filling but did not like the crust the taste of butter was overwhelming in the future i may prepare standard scratch pie crust with this filling
2,with no offense meant to the creator of this recipe i felt cheated with a name like zucchini pizza casserole i expected some pizza flavors i didnt get any of that at all it was tasty as made according to the recipe but disappointing i kind of thought the zucchini layer on the bottom would be more like a crust but it wasnt i will try this again but i have some other ideas to ramp it up
2,we didnt care for this at all
2,dont know what these people are talking about its not even a pizza as the zucchini crust never gets crispy its a casserole
2,definitely not a keeper for our house made exactly according to directions and our year old pushed her bowl away saying no thank you yuck the teenager tried two bites and decided on a sandwich and the two adults ate it but said never again will stick to a traditional potato soup
2,so after reading all of the many raves about this i thought for sure it would be better then the banana bread recipe that i already have it was not it was moist on the inside but way too hard on the outside i did use lemon juice and milk instead of buttermilk and i just used bananas like the recipe called for rather then the three that many of you recommended perhaps that is why mine did not turn out so great
2,since there was no cinnamon nutmeg or apple pie spice in this recipe there was really no flavor crust was good but if i make again i will be adding the spices
2,i dont agree with the majority of these reviews i followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding extra onions and an additional cup of sharp cheddar cheese on topneither of which should detract from the flavor quite the opposite in fact i found it rather bland and neither of my two men asked for seconds right now my husband is eating a peanut butter amp jelly sandwich instead my son described it as ok for me its not to be repeated hope i can get someone to eat the leftovers
2,i served this for th of july yesterday i thought id like it better than i did it made a lot which was a plus but it was really missing something in the flavor i found it unappealing and wished id served something else inhad people for dinner people ate it i had half a bowl left over my husband said it was okay and that he liked it well enough but i didnt notice anyone really excited about it too bad it sounded like something id likeperhaps id like it with a different dressing i think the dressing was a deal breaker for me maybe ill try it again but use a favorite coleslaw dressing on it instead also i wasnt crazy about the chestnuts if i do it again ill use chopped jicama instead
2,to sweet i added mustard and it cut the sweetness but still did not care for it
2,sorry hate to write a negative review but thought this was terribly bland added a bit of horseradish celery seed more vinegar salt and pepper and more miracle whip to get it just ok
2,just okay its your average banana bread
2,it really was not as good as i was hoping it would be turned out okay but not the best
2,way too sweet the crisp topping was nice there was a nice balance of oats to sugar and butter and flour the apple mixture was horribly sweet i love sweet but after a few bites i had enough my son and husband who usually pick away at the rest of the pan finished theirs but that was it i was ready to throw the rest away when i decided to use it as a topping for steel cut oats this morning with a ratio of two parts oat to apple topping it was perfect with unsweetened coffee next time i would cut the sugar in half it is also a nice mixin with greek yogurt but as a dessert a big disappointment for such great reviews
2,i chose this one of many i found because of its rating however it was just barely okayi reduced the sugar in the syrup by a half theres enough sugar in the crumb mixture and the apples and it was still a bit too sweet the topping was heavy in both texture and taste perhaps too much oatmeal i noticed more dessert left on the plates of family members who usually clean them down to the porcelain ill look for another recipe
2,sorry i wasted good ingredients on this recipe
2,i didnt like the the fact that it was thickened first i do that at the end soup was too hot trying to get the spuds done and when i added the cheese it broke looked yucky and no one ate the leftovers garbage can is happy i guess
2,threw most of it down the garbage disposalnot tasty at allnot cheesey enough
2,i just didnt like this one too rich and too seafoody and i love seafood
2,the brown sugar needs to be mixed into the salad and there should be more of it stars
2,made this today for supper and was somewhat disappointed it wasnt as flavorful as i thought it would be i have to wonder about all the folks who thought it was delicious i would rate this recipe as not that great and somewhat below average
2,good one
2,meh not a very good taco recipeif your rating it to taco bell then it would have more starsthe chicken came out bland once all the topping were on and added a few last minute seasonings it became ediblethis inspired me to now go submit my mojito lime tacos
2,didnt have much flavorbut i did add hot salsa to give it more kick
2,very tasty but the bottom tortilla was very hard i let it sit for minutes before we cut it and it still oozed all over the place did not turn out wellmaybe my salsa was too watery im not sure but we couldnt even save it for leftovers it was too runny
2,i thought the italian dressing totally overpowered the casserole i already have wonderful enchilada casserole recipes three of which i got from this websiteso i will be sticking with those it would probably be ok without the italian dressing but i wont be trying it again
2,i dont understand the high ratings this would have been flavorless had i not added extra seasoning hard to believe this won any contest
2,it was horrible the italian dressing does not belong in a mexican casserole it overpowered all the other flavors even the dogs wouldnt eat it
2,very greasy would not be making it again
2,i thought it was just ok wont make again
2,i made this recipe today and i would have to say its nothing great i did not add the potatoes and celery as these are not things i would typically expect in a cheeseburger soup however i did add the carrots as it is nice to have some veggies in there i also added macaroni so it wasnt just liquid cheese i was eating i guess i just hate american cheese its very fake tasting and leaves a sticky coating in your mouth i am going to try this recipe again with real cheddar and hopefully it comes out tastier
2,i was really disappointed with this particularly after reading all the rave reviews i wont make the filling again because it was tasteless even after adding spices and didnt set right but i will be using the crust recipe a recipe for the next pie i make perhaps that will turn out betterreserving just a cup for topping left the crust really thick so i reserved about cup which turned out nicely i used different kinds of apples to get a flavor blend and sprinkled some cinnamon and nutmeg on the bottom crust before putting the apple mixture in unfortunately this still didnt really give the filling any flavor i was amazed at how thick the watercornstarchsugar mixture got after boiling but it was really jellylike when i took it out of the oven i was worried that it wouldnt set as it cooled and it didnt reallyi will say though that every toh pie recipe i read calls for a pie dish but every one i make needs a deep dish pan dont believe what you read in the recipe it doesnt fit in the smaller dish
2,way to sweet for me the cornstarch and sugar overpowered the apples
2,this cake was delicious had a lot of trouble with the frosting as would not set up with all that butter kept it in the refrigerator to keep it intact if i make it again will certainly change the frosting recipe
2,the cake turned out well but i think cups of butter is too much butteri now have chocolate soup chilling so i can ice this cakethinking about only making the ganache instead
2,this crust has no baking powder or baking soda and it results in being very flat there are better recipes than this one
2,i followed the instructions exactly and baked for even longer than the recipe said the video says the written recipe says i did it was brown on top i took it out cooled it put on the glaze and cut it it was still raw im baking it again but it is probably ruined since it already glazed havent even gotten to taste it
2,before making these recipes i always read the reviews since this had good ones and i love cherry desserts i made them they seemed baked through and browning on the top but as they sat they just kept getting softer and softer they taste good but you have to use a spatula to serve them
2,this pie tasted ok but the filling from the cornstarch mixture was very unappealing with the clear gel surrounding the diced apples
2,my family usually loves mexican food but neither my husband nor i cared for it at all i was very disappointed
2,so so recipe its more like a soup than a hearty chili the recipe calls for way too much chicken stock half that amount would have been more than enough the chili never thickens no matter how long you cook it again this should be called soup not chili way better chili recipes out there wont make again
2,my husband did not like this and i would use corn tortillas instead of flour
2,i made this with the flour tortillas and they were soggy slimy and did not taste good we ended up dishing out the filling which was good and not eating the tortillas at all if i were to make this again i would use tortilla chips instead
2,this totally fell apart when i tried to take it out of the pan after min of cooling i had greased the pan and it did come out but it came out a total mess i followed the directions to the letter
2,i did everything the recipe said except i only had to bake it minutes the top came out hardnot crusty but hard and chewy i couldnt taste any of the lemon flavoring next time i will add alittle more lemon juiceif i make it at all i was very disappointed
2,used no salt added chicken broth did not add salt after hours meat was overdone and inedible and potatoes and onions merely okay waste of money on pork chops i will never make this recipe again salinity was fine
2,i should have read the reviews with this one the sauce is too thick and so the end product isnt as creamy as id like it was too dry for the effort this took it wasnt worth it
2,i have had this recipe for a couple of years amp needed a meatless casserole so made it i should have read the reviews it had way too much sauce my husband liked it and that is the only reason i would ever make it again if there is a next time ill use twice as much macaroni and bake it in a x baking dishhad way too much sauce
2,it was simple and plain in my opinion it tasted like a vanilla wafer cookie with cherry pie filling spread on it its so sweet you can eat it without the icing sorry to say i dont think i will be making this one again i would give it one star but my son said it should be a least two stars due to the sweetness factor
2,add milk next time you bake these
2,very basic as it states i added chocolate chips and they still turned out very dense wont make again
2,i followed recipe to a t have made muffins for years but these turned out dense
2,poor taste compaired to other recipes
2,excellent layers of flavor i didnt make this in a crock pot because there wasnt time i sauted all of the vegies in olive oil first added the spices except i used paprika instead of cayenne because my husband has acid issues i added tbl of cumin and tbl crushed bay leaves browned chicken and sausages added to mix brought to bowl in dutch oven and simmered for minutes then added the shrimp and simmered more minutes flavors were layered and distinct will add this to my chefs list and serve with confidence to my clients
2,way too sweet and does not make doz i wont be making them again
2,this recipe was not to my liking i found it to be overly sweet and i did not care for the crisp part it was not crispy enough
2,too sweet with the brown sugar omit that and cut back on the fat please
2,i decided to make it today after reading the reviews but it was extremely sweet i wont make it again
2,we just moved into a house we bought and it had apple trees dont know what kind they were but the sauce did not thicken up my crust was good does it matter what kind of apples i used i cooked it longer then what it said any suggestions for next time
2,was disappointed in the runniest of this pie had to use several paper towels to sop up runny juices did not read reviews before putting top crust on would suggest taste of home rewrite recipe it for sure needs more flour on the upside has a good flavor we used honeycrisp gala macintosh and some sort of fancy apple just disappointed it was runny
2,agree with john this looks great very easy to make but despite how wonderful it looks it doesnt have a lot of flavor for folks who cant have a lot of flavorful things due to diet restrictions this may be a really good recipe good recipe to build on perhaps fry the potato slices some to golden brown in the leftover pork chop drippings add some garlic somewhere it needs more umph for me r
2,not impressed wont make this again
2,i was not impressed i found the potatoes bland and needed something the chops were overcooked but i did use loin chops still an hour and a half i think would dry out most chops i wouldn t follow this recipe again without some serious changes
2,i was very disappointed in this recipe i havent eaten it yet but i almost want to toss the whole thing in the trash it looks like a disaster ive never had a problem with recipes not turning out and bake quite often i should have used my better judgement with this frosting and altered it but i wanted to try the recipe just as it was written to see what i thought i wanted to surprise my husband with this cake but im embarrassed to show it to him the frosting is so runny and didnt set up at all it makes the cake look like i just dumped a liquid over the top it looks nothing like the picture dont make the same mistake i did do like many other reviewers and make your own frosting or you will just waste time and ingredients
2,disappointing all you could taste was citrus not sure what i am going to do with the leftover chicken now as it wasnt enjoyed
2,im definitely in the minority on with this rating but i used inch cake pans and had about a cup of overflow onto the bottom of my oven the rim of the pan was also covered with batter which made removal from the pan difficult followed the instructions exactly and didnt change a thing think ill cut back on the amount of strawberries in the frosting to avoid a runny frosting its for my grand daughters birthday and im hoping the frosting covers up the messy cake
2,a bit too rich for my taste if i make it again i think i would do a light whipped cream topping with strawberries rather than the frosting from this recipe which just felt like too much
2,i wanted so much to love this cake the strawberry smell and taste were terrific but the cake with the sugar in the jello and the cake mix was far too sweet the frosting was almost inedible it was so sweet when eaten with the cake we scraped the frosting off and topped each piece with a dollop of greek yogurt and it was delicious but would have been equally so with whipped topping or ice cream if i were to make it again i would probably make it from scratch and reduce the sugar and serve it unfrosted i added some dried strawberries which i had processed a couple of spoonful to enhance the strawberry flavor
2,i havent made this yet but plan on it does anyone know if i use olive oil if it will make a difference
3,this is okbut my mamaw would never use a mix
3,ive made a similar recipe before and it called for pans not using it took almost minutes longer to bake than recipe time i used aluminum pans also ingredients were missing from main list and only mentioned in video other than that its tasty and still moist with extra baking time i did like folding in chopped berries to cake instead of using mixer
3,i followed the recipe exactly as written mine turned out very moist and would not hold together not sure what i did wrong the taste is good i made sure the toothpick came out clean my husband thinks it did not bake long enough i was wondering if i cut the strawberries too small and had too many the frosting was fine using almost cups of sugar
3,the cake recipe is a winner but skip the icing it way too sweet i wish i had read the reviews before i dove into this one the cake recipe came out great and can see adapting this with other combos of jello and fruit maybe lime the icing didnt do it for me others suggested a cream cheese icing would work much better icing out the tub or even cool whip would be better that the suggested icing
3,my heavens most of you people act like this is some new invention this recipe has been around for about years its a good enough cake but i have adapted mine to scratch rather than using cake mix much better
3,havent made yet dont care for cottage cheese in recipes wonder if you could substitute ricotta instead
3,it tasted good but burned the bottom of my slow cooker make sure you spray with a vegetable oil before putting it together
3,i have made this recipe twice and the noodles are always very soggy even when i lessened the cooking time the flavour is good though
3,i made this but cut the recipe in half for two people it wasnt bad but seemed to lack something rather bland for us this is not a keeper i didnt like the clumping of the shredded provolone cheese
3,i think the recipe is pretty good overall but unhappy with the noodles probably the brand because we usually like rice noodles
3,im confused in the description it says maybe its the cream cheese i cant find and cream cheese listed in the ingredients
3,i was really excited when i saw this recipe because the seasonings made it look like it would be perfect seasonings were very similar to lawrys fajita mix which i think is very good unfortunately i was quite disappointed if i were to make it again which i will not be doing i would definitely add more green amp red peppers probably a total of peppers in all for the pounds of chicken
3,i loved this recipe i say loved becausesomething got changed can someone help me out it was so thick this time i made it and i hate ginger so there definitely was none in there before whatever changes got put into this recipe anybody have the original recipe from before cuz it was the best apple pie id ever had
3,toss the apples with the lemon juice then the sugars to coat then cook in large skillet to start the cooking process and reduce the liquid med heat toss frequent cover to cook apples after look at the liquid add the flour table spoons at a time tossing as you go if its tighten up take off heat then add to ready pie shell bake as before
3,they are ok not todiefor easy enough that i may make again but other desserts outshine these in tastea little heavy on the almond extract turn out well if prepared exactly as directions say but need to bake longer in the oven
3,mixed emotions about these the crust and toping is lacking something i think maybe a sweeter crumb topping might be better
3,this recipe was delicious i will make this again but will definitely increase the baking time i baked for approximately minutes and the bars in the center of pan were gooey and underbaked i made them for a potluck and i could not serve the bars in the center they were a gooey mess
3,this recipe was very good i think next time i make them i would use large can of pie filling instead of regular size cans
3,just ok was rich and not the flavor i was looking for maybe as someone suggested adding some hot sauce might of giving me the flavor i was looking for
3,great taste on this bread but ive tried it a couple times and im having the same issue as a previous reviewer the sides brown way to much long before the loaf is done i tried doubling the recipe and making loaves to cut the cook time but still had the same problem maybe ill try muffins out of it next time
3,i made this yesterday and it came out fine it was tasty and spicy but i like deddmen cant get over it not being like jambalaya since the rice is not cooked in the sauce which is very soupy more like gumbo but without the roux which i know is what makes it gumbo next time i will cook the rice with the sauce not separately
3,to much of a green pepper taste for me my year old said it was ok my hubby seemed to like it
3,this is a good basic jambalaya recipe all of the core ingredients are here however the cayenne and hot pepper just make it hot vs a balanced blend of flavors with the other herbs in order to supplement the flavor we cut back on the salt and added worcestershire made this due to the convenience of the slow cooker however time permitting i would use my old stand by southern jambalaya recipe in the future
3,this just did not hit me like i thought it would like others i think the cooking time was way too long and caused the meat to get dry the overall flavor just wasnt there
3,finally a recipe that doesnt have a lot of hot spices added to it i go to an amish town in missouri and enjoy food that has natural seasoning and taste without all the spices
3,i agree with a previous review too much flourthe dish is very tasty but i found the cheese sauce too heavy will make again but decrease the flour to make a thinner consistency
3,i didnt use all the cheese sauce this made mine came out a lot thicker than i expected i will make this again but cut way back on the flour needed for this roux i almost threw it out but added almost twice the milk and kept on it was tasty but i think it was because of the seasonings this recipe needs tweaking
3,it was ultimately cheesey that is a fact it was very thick i added a cup of pasta water to mine and it was still very thick i however do not bake my mac n cheese i just do not prefer it that way and i left out the mustard not a fan but it was very cheesey and flavor was tastey just too cheesey for usotherwise it was a good recipe
3,i havent tried this recipe but really want to find one similar to what i made as a teenager without oats if carolanne could share her tried an true i would like to see if hers is made without oats
3,this recipe was way too sweet for my taste i used a granny smith a johnathon amp a mcintosh apple
3,i did not care for this recipe i thought that the filling was too gelatinous and sweet
3,very good
3,this was ok i thought the sauce was very thick as others have mentioned if i make it again i will try less flour or try to thin the sauce i have other mac n cheese recipes from taste of home that my family likes better
3,this wasnt bad but id try other recipes before trying to tweak this one anymore i followed suggestions to not have a pasty taste by decreasing the flour and increasing the milk but it was still a bit too thick and pasty for my taste i did increase the macaroni to almost double so that made a difference but there was an unbelievable amount of sauce im sure if id have used cups as stated it still would have been pasty so not terrible but ill try others
3,they were moist but not a big fan of the oatmeal with them they were easy to make though
3,followed recipe exactly and first time using this recipe i was very disappointed in how it turned out did not raise and edges burned even tho i thought it a good idea to loosely cover with foil once i saw the edges browning this was supposed to be a gift but could not in good conscience give it to anyone have not tasted it yet but in the future will go back to my reliable standby recipe which i thought was lost but have since found as something is not quite right with this one
3,these were not bad but were dense with no leavening and just didnt seem quite right might be worth trying to add some baking powder because the flavor was pretty good apart from it had a slight eggy flavor
3,this sounds good but way too many fat calories from the cheese
3,these muffins are moist but way too sweet other recipes i used require less sugar and no vanilla i tried this anyway and its more like a cupcake than muffin
3,cooking pound of bacon and a medium onion together does not work onion burns before the bacon is crisp on medium heat do them separately or start the bacon well before adding the onion
3,made this last night for my husband and me we both thought it was just ok way too cheesy if i make it again i would definitely cut the cottage cheese in half as we felt it was overwhelming and cut back a bit on the other cheeses as well although the recipe calls for quite a bit of bacon we felt the dish couldve used more maybe next time ill substitute chopped link sausages for more substance not sure the potatoes add much to the dish but overall a good basic recipe that can be improved with a few tweaks so im glad i tried it thanks for sharing
3,thought the cheery bars looked good but was more interested in the nutritional value for them i didnt make them as didnt know the point value for weight watchers for my familys needs hopefully soon that infor will be available and i can make these for my family
3,the dough was very dry and i had a hard time keeping it together on the cookie sheet they were falling apart i used old fashioned oats i dont know if that made a difference but i have made other oatmeal cookies with those oats and they were great will not make this recipe again
3,these were really just okay the dough was really dry and i hoped the cookies would be less so as the butter melted but they werent it might have been because i used old fashion oats instead of quickcooking running the old fashion oats through the food processor might have helped with the texture i really dislike crisp cookies so i made them a little bigger than the rounded tsp and baked them for minutes but found even that to be too long i ended up baking for minutes and letting cool on the cookie sheet for minutes before removing to a wire rack they didnt really spread at all i used chocolate pudding mix because thats what i had and i think it was too chocolatey i also decreased the chips to cups sorry but i wont be repeating these im beginning to lose faith in the toh recipes this is the th or th one in a row that hasnt wowed me
3,my wife made this last night she did substitute the white kidney beans for the great northern beans the flavor is excellent for the family and i was able to kick it up a notch with some habanero powder at the table i found the chili to be a little thin for my liking and it would benefit greatly from a rest period to get some more of the flavor into the beans
3,my wife made this last night she did substitute the white kidney beans for the great northern beans the flavor is excellent for the family and i was able to kick it up a notch with some habanero powder at the table i found the chili to be a little thin for my liking and it would benefit greatly from a rest period to get some more of the flavor into the beans
3,i liked this recipe but i thought there was way too much sugar involved i cut both the brown amp the white sugars in half and the final result was exceptionally delicious i made real whipped cream to which i added some cinnamon while whipping it yummy
3,very very sweet even with cutting the sugars in half
3,it was good but the cornstarch mixture was too sweet and overpowered the fruit and crisp even after reducing it if you have a major sweet tooth this is a great recipe but if you prefer your apple to be more prominent id suggest to go light on the sugar cornstarch mixture
3,aside from being way too sweet i thought it was good will make again and just cut down on the oatmeal and brown sugar
3,way too sweet too many chips in each cookie too much sugar then added sugar from the puddingjust too much for me
3,lovely lovely cake i had a hard time finding nice strawberriesso i used a can of pie cherries instead it looked beautiful with the chocolate accents and the cherries cascading down the sides as well as the ganache a big hit at the office christmas party thanks
3,how do you do the ganache the picture has it on before the strawberries but the recipe says to drizzle on tophelp
3,completely underwhelmed with the recipe as written not enough flavor only thing i did differently was add garlic while sauteing the onions i wont be making this again
3,good one
3,cut back to butter and can cherriesgreat
3,great
3,a bear to make unless you have a steady hand
3,my family has been making this recipe for probably years but in the version i have all the ingredients for the sauce are halved water sugar cornstarch thats what is making this version of the recipe way too sweet
3,too sweet didnt care for all the oatmeal either
3,too sweet prefer a more traditional apple crisp with a simple crumb topping made it for a second time tonight and confirmed the sweetness and twice the baking time is a good reason to skip it however if you are feeding people with a serious sweet tooth this is great for you
3,it was okay a lot of oatmeal flavor and not enough cinnamon i like my recipe for apple betty much better
3,after lots of time spent dicing and chopping plus the cooking time i was very disappointed with this recipe the chowder was beautiful but it had no flavor i was expecting so much more especially with all the onions and cheese that i put into it i guess ill have to keep looking for a good cheesy chowder recipe
3,question the stores no longer stock bouillon granules what can be used instead this soup looks and sounds wonderful
3,i made some changes due to suggestions from other reviewers i used eggs instead of i used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese because i really dislike cottage cheese my potatoes were added frozen because i did not notice that the recipe said thawed the casserole was very very dry i assume it was because i added too many eggs the flavor was good and i will try this recipe again only this time i will not make any changes to the original recipe
3,good
3,tasty
3,the look of the cake will impress it was too much chocolate for my taste i will make the ganache to dip in strawberries and i will make the garnishes again
3,not even close to the best banana bread i followed the recipe verbatim so i didnt add numerous additional ingredients and say i made the recipe as a matter of fact i made a better loaf yesterday using a different recipe that was also called the best banana bread the recipe simply doesnt have enough bananas in it its a nice bread but has limited banana flavor i would suggest looking for a different recipe
3,why would anyone use imitation crabmeat in a wonderful dish like this spend a couple more dollars and get the real thing it is so much more flavorful
3,this recipe was okay the first time i made it except for the imitation crab meat and the lack of seasoning the second time i made it i made some changes i used real crab meat twice as much as the recipe calls for i also poached some fresh caught fish and deboned them and added the fish meat to the recipe i did not use scallops because i didnt have any i live on the water and have access to fresh fish shrimp and crabs so that is what i used i also added a little garlic and some cajun seasoning i doubled the sauce recipe and used a lot more cheese the second time i made it it turned out better i will give the original recipe a three star rating and the recipe after my few changes still just three stars and no i will not make it again it serms like something is missing i think its the ricotta cheese that my seafood lasagna recipe calls for
3,very good
3,great ideabut whole grapes are a choking hazard i never serve whole always cut in half
3,good but not excellent
3,easy to make tastes ok id call it average
3,it was alright my husband did not really like it but he liked that it kept him full for a long time
3,nothing fancy but fine for a simple meal
3,loved the if this salad and the ingredients but there just wasnt enough flavor for me i will try it again but next time i will add the same ingredients i use when i make cole slaw and see if that helps it needed more tang
3,wasnt a favorite i didnt care for the vinegary taste wasnt creamy enough im sure if you are a huge coleslaw fan you would love this recipe
3,this salad was just okay i wouldnt make it again
3,great recipe
3,ok for healthy food
3,the recipe was good but did not have the flavor i was expectingi would push lemon juice on the fish first or would use a balsamic vinegar to marinate fish along with cilantro first then continue the recipe
3,for a fish recipe this was okay i have tasted better but i wouldnt discourage someone from making it it is good just not great next time i will follow the advice of tho on the comments and try marinating it in lemon juice first since i will be doing that i will probably use an additional tbsp of lemon juice
3,as written this has far too much sugar for my taste c was plenty the nd time aroundespecially since i used bananas that were black reducing the sugar and upping the banana by gives far more banana flavor black bananas are much sweeter so no sweetness is losti think i will stick to my normal recipe sorry
3,i made this as directed for easter dinner and think the dressing seems too heavy and twice what is needed if i make it again i would use oz of cream cheese c sour cream and substitute brown sugar for the white sugar and skip sprinkling it over the top i made this according to directions and while it is tasty the dressing is just too thick for my taste
3,i made this for a dinner party we had at our house first off for this many grapes at about pound cheapest i could find anywhere in february was over in grapes alone not a cheap dish to make when you add up all the ingredients i thought the cream cheese mix was tasty although heavy honestly thought with all the rave reviews that we would be wowed but in the end not one person of folks kids included mentioned that they liked it i would not make again
3,my family found this to be extremely sweet with too much of the cream mixture for the amount of grapes it also seems like more of a dessert than a salad
3,i found that a little of this goes a long way as it is somewhat on the sweet side
3,good but didnt think it was as great as the reviews made it out to be probably would have liked it better with less sour cream taste was easy to make
3,if i do ever make this again i would cut the cream cheese mixture in half
3,this recipe was easy to make and tasty however i found it very bland i was worried when preparing it that it would be but wasnt sure if the saltiness of the bacon would be enough so i didnt alter the recipe except to make it with eggs after eating it i would definitely add salt and pepper and maybe even some green and red peppers it has the potential to be a wonderful recipe
3,after reading a lot of the five star reviews i made a double recipe for a church potluck picnic exactly as posted it was good but not great was the opinion of quite a few people luckily there were a lot of people so i only had a small bowl leftover if i make it again i would greatly reduce or omit the vinegar in the dressing and not use the water chestnuts since i asked and no one tasted them in the salad maybe using sliced or slicing the whole and not chopping would have made a difference
3,this recipe is ok but i have another similar recipe we like much better i think the hashed browns make this a little heavy
3,i cant quite put my finger on why this wasnt my favorite but i think i would skip the worcestershire sauce and ketchup and just make a beef broth type gravy to mix in and also i would probably omit the peas or put in fewer and add in some carrots it wasnt bad but not something i would make again unless i adjusted it more to my tastes
3,this was just okay its a little bland i think if i make it again ill add some tomato paste or something to flavor it up
3,this was tasty and easy but not awesome i followed recipe exactly first time it was okay nd time i substituted mild pork sausage for hamburger full cream for half and half and added dried minced parsley in filling and on top much better next time i will add minced sautéed mushrooms and a bit more italian seasoning easy and everyone liked it
3,easy to make looks exactly like the picture taste is sweet and blah
3,not very exciting it reminded me of eating the sponge cake part of a twinkie without the fun of the cream filled center would make a good cake base for a fruit topping but it doesnt stand up well alone
3,i poked holes n the top of the cake and poured some cream of coconut over the top oh so moist i did a change tho i didnt put cups of sugar in it i is a diabetic i used cup of sugar had rave reviews from every loved it
3,very bland recipe throw some sriracha honey more pepper onion something save this recipe somehow someway
3,i made this recipe tonight for dinner i wanted to try it because it has capers in it and i had never cooked with them before the fish was good but i thought it was lacking a little somethingi am not sure what if i tried it again i would probably try to add another an additional spice to it but hey i am just a beginner lol
3,i was not a big fan it was easy to make but used more ingredients and was more expensive to make than another recipe i have
3,i made this a week ago and felt i should like it since ive heard so much about this type of roast i used this recipe which except i added the pepperoncini as the recipe for mississippi pot roast uses it was just average was hoping to rave about it but cant wont make this again
3,not impressed meshy and salty from that amount of bacon
3,great but pretty rich and too sweet
3,a little too sweetrich for our taste but it is good
3,great recipe but with the omissions i deleted stars for taste i would give it i am an experienced baker and made this recipe as written except for the notes i made belowif someone were a novice baker this should be a simple enough recipe but it will not turn out as expected unless you recognize andor correct the followingsalt salt is necessary unless you are using salted butter most people bake with unsalted butter since it allows the baker to control the salt in the recipe this recipe may have been written for use with salted butter but since it is not noted to use salted butter instead of the usual unsalted it will come out bland without the addition of salt i added tsp and it came out perfectbatter my batter was unusually runny i would even call it watery i have made cakes with very runny batter previously but i was unsure if this was one of those super moist types since the recipe didnt mention the consistency of the batter i added cup of ap flour just to be on the safe side and it came out very dense and moist without a lot of rise your results may vary however
3,this is pretty decent but the magnolia bakerys vanilla birthday cake is very similar to this and i do like the texture better i would make this again though it is quick and easy to make
3,this was a fun cake to makevery simply and very good didnt miss the frosting at all
3,stars to make a comment no salt ive been comparing this recipe to many others on the internet and this is the only one without salt i would guess this is why some other reviewers find this cake bland
3,i added cottage cheese or ricotta if you prefer and parmesan cheese i found that the ravioli dough is much thicker than lasagna noodles and it cooked a lot slower than i thought it would it also needed much more sauce than the recipe indicated as you are cooking it in the sauce next time i will cook them in water first then drain and continue with recipe
3,i followed the recipe as it but the cake came out dense i was expecting a lighter fluffier cake the flavor of the cake was good but the texture was not what i was expecting i was expecting a lighter more spongier cake
3,if you follow this recipe youll get a cake thats pretty dense the recipe has the right ingredients but the wrong steps for a fluffy cake only use a mixer to beat the eggs and sugar after that use a spatula to mix everything else in because if you continue to use a mixer youll beat out a lot of air bubbles from the mixture which will make it less fluffy also add the milk and butter before the flour because adding the flour first will make the mixture so dense that it will push out the air from the mixture if you prefer something less sweet use cups of sugar instead of you could also melt the butter first before stirring in the milk just to make it melt faster
3,i made this as a birthday cake doubled the recipe instead of cherries used strawberries all over the top of cake omitted the walnuts it was delicious
3,i gave this recipe three stars as canola oil is so unhealthy i used organic coconut oil instead plus about a tablespoon of butter i used cup of sugar and used large overripe bananas instead of two i didnt measure but it was probably more than the cup of bananas called for in the recipe in addition because of the extra banana i was able to cut the eggs down to one but i did use a large eggi added cup raisins and cup chocolate chips as my family likes that but they arent necessary as i tasted the mixture before baking and it was plenty sweet i wasnt sure about baking it at degreesso halfway through i upped it to degrees i dont think it made any differencebut i do have a convection oven
3,i made two loaves so i could use the whole can one i cooked in glass pyrex and janet is correct mine took h minutes as well the second i baked in a metal pan and after minutes it was done this pumkin bread remains a very dense and moist cake we liked the flavor but will not be making this again
3,ive come up with a much more diabeticfriendly version of this recipe by substituting whole wheat pastry flour for the white flour stevia for the white sugar and cup unsweetened applesauce for half of the canola oil and added teaspoon of ground ginger simply because i love the taste of ginger no one whos tried my version has even noticed the difference but mine has less fat healthier carbs no sugar and more fiber
3,the center of my loaf wasnt completely cooked until hour minutes even though i foiled the edges my loaf still turned out very dark with a slight burnt flavor nonetheless the bread remained moist i substituted raisins with chocolate chips not terribly impressed with this recipe
3,i thought this would be very good but to me just ehhh ok not a bread texture but more like cake and kinda dry i allways make the pumpkin spice bread from here it is very good now thats good pumpkin bread but i sometimes add nuts and raisins but will not make this again i just dont get all the good reviews taste not that good to me just a waste gonna make the pumpkin spice bread and stick to that been making that for years so moist and delicious
3,not sure why but my family didnt care for this that much
3,really easy to make i added mushrooms to mine and i used soy ground beef vegetarian and it turned out well nothing too exciting but easy and cheap cant go wrong there
3,i like sour cream but i think cup is too much my batch tasted more like sour cream noodles than like chicken noodle soup
3,i made this soup according to directions it was quick and easy to make with ready made soup and bouillon while it tasted good it is bland next time i will make my own cream of chicken soup and add onions celery carrots garlic salt and pepper to enhance the flavors
3,easy enough to make and very professional and glamorous looking a real showpiece i thought cake was a little dry frosting was good but ive made better with less expensive ingredients
3,frosting was good
3,when do you put in the green onions and the cheese you have listed in your ingredients they are not in your directions
3,this made a really high cake it was over inches when done and it was nice and moist but lacked chocolate flavour i would probably not waste such expensive ingredients again i have a sour cream chocolate cake which is better and less expensive
3,i was highly disappointed in the icing because i went exactly by the recipe and when i finished it it tasted more like sour cream and confectioners sugar i didnt enjoy it i wanted more a chocolate taste
3,i will make it but i will make it healthier by not using poison for sweetening sugar only no artificial crap that makes you anemic union of concerned scientists wanted crossbones on artificial sweeteners splenda takes the red blood cells down my mom ended up in hospital with severe anemia i was borderline doc ordered me to never use any of it again so i will use the full fat and calorie version i want to stay healthy
3,i would like this better with actual cream and sugar not the chemical substitutes dont care for the taste or texture of fat free milk either
3,im surprised others have not commented on two aspects of this recipe if you put the batter of a oz cake mix jiffy in a x baking pan you are going to have a very thin cake and the part where you are supposed to sprinkle the pineapple on then try to spread cool whip over that really that would just make a mess in my opinion none of my ingredients are fat or sugar free or low fat i used two jiffy cake mixes i was out of instant pudding so i used the cook amp serve pudding cooled it and mixed it in with the cream cheese the pudding blends nicely with the cream cheese in a bowl i folded the cool whip into the drained pineapple and spread that on then added some cherries on the top i skipped the nuts it looks quite pretty havent tasted it yet but it should be delicious
3,i made this cake for my brothers birthdayall the adults liked it because it wasnt very sweet and had a light texturekids did not touched it because unfortunately theyre used to the grocery store kind of cakemei did not liked the combination of the vanilla pudding and the cream cheesenext time ill leave out the latterit is a good recipe overall
3,i made this recipe exactly as written and mine came out much drier i think it should have we were really disappointed in it the first night the second night i served with sour cream and enchilada sauce and it was much better but still not something that i would make it again if i did make it again i would make some changes one of which would be to incorporate the sour cream and the enchilada sauce into the layers i would liked to have given this ½ stars it was not awful so i did not want to give it stars just not that special it does make a lot
3,this was pretty good but not a favorite as far as mexican lasagnas go my family likes the other one i make better
3,it does make the outer edge of the casserole bit crispy on the tortillas when bake for minutes but it is a great time saving recipe if you need dinner on the table fast if you like southwestern food it would be a good recipe to try out i just suggest baking it for or minutes any longer the outer edges of the tortilla will be to crispy
3,made this recipe to the letter except added walnuts to the batter and frosting batter mixes up well and bakes quickly in the sheet cake pan frosting is tasty but does not have as strong of a cream cheese flavor as recipes made without the added butter this one has the cake is relatively moist and has a nice texture but without any spices it tastes a bit bland i will make this again but will add some cinnamon andor nutmeg to give it a bit of a boost in flavor
3,this bread was so delicious and moist i think i used chopped pecans in my first batch and we didnt really like them next time i may try another nut or just leave them off entirely i also added some nutmeg and cloves to bring out some of the flavor and next time i may add more pumpkin spice nutmet and cloves next time to see if it helps bring out the flavor other than that this was a great recipe that i will be making again in the fall
3,we liked this but i left out the black beans it was a good meal and we had lots leftover would cut recipe in half next time
3,i made this recipe yesterday i followed everything the recipe says i had it in the fridge over night i went to cut into it today and the jello part is completely soupy can anyone tell me what went wrong ps very disappointed
3,i want to be fair with this one as some people may like it so here goesi made this in a glass pyrex x dish i bought all of the ingredients as written but did end up with cups of coarsely crushed pretzels as i did not want to toss them it still worked fine and amply covered the bottom of the dish the crème cheese layer worked best by beating the crème cheese and sugar and then folding in the whip topping as another reviewer recommended i was skeptical about the jello layer but followed instructions exactly and it worked fine i put in fridge after first layer for about minutes second layer a bit longer and def spread to edges as another reviewer wisely recommended jello layer chilled for a few hours sliced beautifully looked pretty on a plate did not top with additional whip cream and honestly it did not need any extra sugar so that would have mainly been for plating this is where i have to say it was way too sweet no way around it either but i may remove the syrup filled strawberries with fresh the other steps could perhaps be reduced in sugar but not eliminated as the sugar serves more than one purpose so aside from being overly sweet this would be a very nice desert i would never name this a salad or serve with a meal though
3,to me the cornbread is pretty dense and cake like as some of the other reviews mention it is also very sweet too a little too sweet for me good flavor and i dont regret making just not what i look for in my cornbread if i make again ill cut down the amount of sugar if you like your cornbread really sweet and cake like this is the recipe for you
3,i have a recipe i love and thought i would give this one a try my old favorite is much better
3,i followed recipe and this wasnt a hit with my partner the sauce just wasnt there or so thin it just fell through the noodles to the bottom of plate the flavor was also just so so for me thinking maybe adding some cream and maybe a touch of dill right before the the breadcrumbs and cheese might have helped the flavor and thicken the sauce a bit
3,this may be better with a few changes little bland and too much lemon
3,this was ok it needs double the sauce and half the parsley my hubby did not like it at all
3,im confused im trying to mkae this right now it says cups oz velveeta but there are oz in a cup help
3,in my view bars are denser than cake i should have realized that with three eggs this recipe was going to be more cakey than barlike it tastes good but its not what i expected or wanted
3,i am baking these banana bars now i used a x x inch pan as directed jelly roll size the batter is overflowing into the bottom of my oven did anyone else have that problem
3,i made this and while it was very tasty i didnt care for the pretzel crust i will make this again but will use a graham cracker crust
3,the recipe list would probably be better suited for a x pan with the ingredients on this list i got a very thin filling layer that took work to spread without pulling up the pretzels after they were baked
3,this recipe was very delicious exceptthe jello ran down the sides of the filling and sogitized made soggy the pretzel crust i think next time ill skip the gelatin and use a cooked concoction of berries and cornstarch and yes the x dish is too large in my opinion
3,great recipe and taste great love the salty and sweet the only reason why i gave stars was trying to cut through the sliced strawberries was a problem maybe next time ill cut the berries in slivers will try again
3,my family didnt care much for this recipe
3,i made this exact recipe and it was too grainy and falling apart and too sweet it wasnt horrible but its not great corn bread either
3,i was curious about this recipe cup sugar no way was i going to use that much sugar personally i will go back to my cup cornbreadflour ratio as family likes my old standby better but i find it interesting to try new cornbread recipes
3,good but not as amazing as i had hoped by the reviews
3,i would prefer something other than canned soups your suggestions
3,not bad it came out a little plain and had no taste i followed the recipe without any changes i would add more salt and seasonings before baking this dish i added seasonings and hot sauce to this after i noticed it had no taste and it eas then edible and i didnt mind it but my husband barely touched his plate so i wouldnt make this again
3,i made this recipe because of all of the great reviews im not sure if i would make it again because i felt it was just ok
3,i thought this was pretty goodadded garlic cause i think spaghetti has to have garlic lol
3,bland
3,i made this but honestly im a quick short cut cook i skipped the cooking the veg part added three kinds of sweet peppers sliced mushrooms used half of a whole chicken which i chopped didnt have romano cheese used parmesan i also used two generous teaspoons of italian seasoning all about substituting right i put it in a preheated oven uncovered for mins then turned the oven down to for another we loved it i would make it again
3,i made this for the first time last week as someone else mentioned it was quite time consuming but some of the ingredients could be prepped in advance it was okay in the end had more flavor the next day eaten as leftovers after it sat in the fridge overnight i found that the chunks of chicken became overcooked a bit when following the cooking instructions
3,so time consuming i dont think the outcome was worth the effort i forgot romano cheese which i didnt have anyway so i sprinkled parmesan on top which improved the taste im sure the taste would be better had i remembered the romano but again lots of time required to make this
3,was just ok wont make again
3,we thought this recipe was rather bland the sauce was overpowered by the pasta if i make it again i would add more cheese tomatospaghetti sauce and less pasta
3,my husband liked this recipe but i didnt care that much for it but i used canned spaghetti sauce and a can of mushrooms so maybe had i made it according to the recipe it would have been better dont know though as i doubt ill try it again
3,i dont get what all the fuss is about i made this for my family of plus my motherinlaw who was visiting none of us thought it was anything special it was okay but i cant see that ill be making it again
3,the bars are alright but nothing special i used just one cup of sugar in the filling and it turned out fine i think the crust is too thick the topping doesnt add much to the recipe and i think it is unnecessary
3,i was so excited about this recipe but my husband and i felt there was something missing we will try it again as a base but play around with the seasoning we thought the sour cream made it seem like stroganoff soup so well leave that out next time
3,i was so excited about this recipe but my husband and i felt there was something missing we will try it again as a base but play around with the seasoning we thought the sour cream made it seem like stroganoff soup so well leave that out next time
3,this is a refreshing dessert and it is light i think personally the topping has too much pineapple but im not a strong pineapple lover i like the coconut idea just adds more calories easy to make looks good and tastes good
3,i cut this recipe in half but used the full can of soup diluted with cup water per the instructions using that amount of water the soup is too thick to pour and it really doesnt cover the top of only half the recipe the olives and oregano give it some flavor but this casserole needs the optional beef or even sausage to make it delicious
3,this dish was ok but nothing fantastic to us time consuming to put together also not likely to make it again
3,dish needed more sauce and sausage mixed with ground beef or turkey wouldve been much better overall flavor was good though
3,this was just ok to us
3,it was ok maybe use less chicken next time
3,my husband and i both agreed that this dish was ok but not fabulous its easy to make but tastes a bit bland
3,only makes cookies
3,i made dozen of these for a christening instead of multiplying the recipe i did the same recipe times and it made different consistency cookies i made no changes per batch this is an inconsistent recipe i would never recommend it for multiple dozen cookies especially to be served on platter but the taste is good
3,i have made these twice they taste divine especially when warm dont get me wrong but both times they spread like crazy i wanted to give these as a small treat to a client my family dog sits but they look ugly still delicious treat but never make these for guests i followed the recipe exactly
3,need more orange use larger can idea add banana on cake before the topping
3,its a toss up between a amp i was not impressed w this cake at all i thought it was dry and did not taste orange at all the pudding size is a typo too this recipe has potential and i will remake it but not without making my own tweaks to improve it to my own liking topping was great i have made the same topping using coconut cream pudding and pineapple
3,in my opinion this is not the best ever banana bread there is one in a southern living cookbook which is the best i have had
3,i made this exactly as written i dont like making alterations until ive tried it as suggested i dislike reading reviews that change it all up when you do that its a different recipe anyway the chowder was good but not excellent ive had a lot of chowders especially in maine and they are delicious i like a thicker richer body and more clams wish i had access to fresh clams at a decent price here in the midwest if you like a thinner broth youll probably like it
3,this is a nice base but if you even have a little bit of concern for your health i know were talking a chowder here this thing is an absolute saltsodium bomb i tried it as is the first time and modified the next to bring it down first i know its delicious but skip the bacon and sautee the vegetables in a little butter reduce the chicken bouillon which is the main culprit of unnecessary sodium down to just half a teaspoon switch to black pepper to amp up the flavoring a little and cook the rest as recommended incidentally the modified version tasted much more like authentic clam chowder from new england
3,very good consistency and easy to make but i think it needs more clam flavor i will substitute another bottle of clam juice for the water if i make it again and add more clams
3,great taste and smell a bit too sweet for me so id cut the sugar down also was a runny mess will need to add a little more flour and coconut but plan to make again
3,too much sugar in this recipe both added and hidden try using tomato paste with a little worchestershire sauce stirred in for your topping with bell pepper rings for garnish i like the yellow ones instead of a runnier sauce you will have a tangier topping that is absorbed into the flavor of the meatloaf in the top layer change the saltines to seasoned bread crumbs italian or garlic seasoned add chopped sundried tomatoes to bring hints of the tomato tang throughout the meatloaf and use chopped sweet hawaiian onions for a flavor balance
3,held form well well and texture good a little too salty for my taste with saltines and salt may leave salt out next time
3,epic failure dont know what we did wrong but it wasnt cake at allmore like apple crisp that wasnt crisp sickening sweet
3,i have made this twice the first time exactly as written the second time with a few changes although i liked the flavor in the first batch the filling was too soupy for my taste also the flour tortillas became soggy in the second batch i eliminated the salsa and used just enough hot sauce to flavor and moisten i also used corn tortillas which is what i am used to with enchiladas i used about half of the can of chiliesi always put a small amount of cream cheese in my enchiladas it adds a nice richness and many people dont even realize it is there although they are aware of the richer flavor a small amount of cream cheese also enhances sandwiches even if they have another type of cheese already
3,my family did not particularly care for the consistency of these enchiladas we found the chicken mixture rather soupy and actually used a slotted spoon to dip the mixture onto the tortillas the flavors are good but we will most likely not make this recipe again
3,didnt care for the flour tortillas corn tortillas would have been better i think filling was just okay
3,this reciepe was okay i had to add lots of different ingedience to make it have good flavor it was easy and a good base to make my own
3,i forgot to add my children loved this i havent seen them eat so much at on sitting they eat more than me
3,made this recipe as is but we didnt care for it which was disappointing after all of the positive reviews will not make again
3,for me there wasnt enough seasoning so i would double the salt and pepper and im gonna try it with a clove or two of garlic next time it could be because i omitted the onions no one in my family likes them but with a little change up this would be amazing was still pretty good though
3,i was very excited to try this recipe based on all the great reviews i liked the simplicity of the recipe and the beef filling for the enchiladas was pretty tasty however i was not a huge fan of the enchilada sauce i have made other fromscratch enchilada sauces ive liked better i think this one called for too much flour for my taste it got pretty thick almost the texture of canned tomato soup before you add water to it the overall taste was good though we even ate leftovers the next day but this is most likely not a recipe ill save to make again
3,i used oatmeal instead of saltines and did not add more salt the meatloaf was bland without sauce and i used coconut sugar instead of brown sugar great flavor on sauce i will follow recipe as is to get the true flavor and i used a meatloaf mixture instead of all ground beef i will make recipe again and post another review some times it doesnt work when substitutions are made from early on or first time following recipe my bad
3,the egg mixture ran all over the pan with the first batch made just as instructed the second batch i beat the egg whites until frothy and then added an additional tbsp of flour they ran less but they still ran i think ill try a different recipe next time
3,it was tasty but way too spicy i had to give it away because no one would eat it
3,i usually just use ketchup for the topping too much sugar in ones diet isnt very good the recipe is great i give it stars
3,trying to eat healthier used ground turkey also added minced garlic good bread crumbs and chili sauce
3,the blending is great the ketchup and brown sugar combo topping is like having candy for diner i suggest using half a ketchupworcestershire in the blend and the rest as the topping no brown sugar
3,i use lbs ground beef and ozs of jimmy dean sage sausage no brown sugar and chopped green pepper also can of evaporated milk and a whole sleeve of crackers the sausage and green pepper takes it to another level still use the sage seasoning and one oz of tomato sauce instead of catsup use half in the meatloaf and half as the topping
3,the sauce i knew would be too sweet for our taste i didnt use any of the brown sugar and instead used less milk and a little ketchup in the meat mixture and of course on top i also used more spice garlic powder marjoram and a lot of pepper as is our preference almost carmelizing the onions is something ive always done it adds a lot more flavor to the meatloaf ive never measured the crackers i just crumble until it looks right this recipe with my modifications is how my mom made meatloaf minus the onions
3,use ground chuck and a half pound of ground pork and also panko bread crumbs no sugar or salt use some diced green pepper and onion for added background flavor maybe a couple of bacon strips on top best ever and better meatloaf sandwiches the next day for diabetes person
3,i have to agree with the other reviewsway too much sour cream cheese and bacon one cup each of sour cream and both cheeses and slices of bacon is better in proportion to the potatoes
3,this was good but too rich for our tastes if i make it again id try using less sour cream
3,this recipe was alright i didnt add the cinnamon to the frosting and everyone loved the frosting i will probably make the frosting again
3,i just made this cake but it stuck so bad to the pan it could not be used as a birthday cake warning use parchment paper it tastes great though
3,i cant help but noticing tbsps of flour for the icing is this an erroralso baking cocoanot sure if i can get it here so can i substitute with the regular cocoa which we mix for tea apart from these enquiries im ok and dying to get started
3,for bushbabe i have several recipes that call for brewed coffee and all i use is instant just make it like you would for a cup of coffee and add it into the recipe any recipe that calls for espresso powder i also use the granulated instant but i crush it to make it a powder then i measure
3,confusing frosting recipe cake turned out great but i used regular sugar for frosting and i think it should have been powdered sugar instead it was gritty it did not specify please correct star
3,nice
3,sounds good ive never tried making this before ive given it a but could it be made with pears instead i have some to use up in the fridge someone please let me know asap
3,my family was not crazy about this soup it had a comforting quality to it but was lacking in flavor or something none of us cold put our finger on what was missing if i make not again i will experiment a little
3,having grown up on mexican food we never used corn tortillas always flour this was too salty and all the spices left us drinking a lot of water dredging the tortillas in the sauce before filling and rolling would make them look more authentic
3,the recipe just seemed to lack a little something i will tyrone more time but next time im roasting my peppers it will probably intensify the flavor and it wont seem like it is not fully cooked
3,like the pervious reviews i left the seeds in the jalapeno to turn up the heat which really worked well however i agree with the review regarding flavor leakness i will make the chili again but with a few changes to kickup the flavor i added more salt and pepper to taste as well as lime juice fresh i perfer my chili thick so i also thicken the chili i added a mix of wide rice as well yum next time i will add more beans and lime juice and the wild rice
3,i was expecting something thicker
3,too soupy needs more flavor
3,after all the star reviews i expected more it was easy and tasted good but it wasnt some amazing recipe i would make it again but i am not putting it on my regular dinner menu
3,i was not very impressed with the flavor or the thin chicken broth it was fair hoping for more flavor because of the spices but maybe i just dont care for white chicken chili i would think they would all be similar
3,if you like sweet corn pudding this is the recipe for you if you dont like it sweet just omit the sugar and use cornbread mix that doesnt have sugar i like to omit the sugar and add cheese jalapenos and onions
3,very rich and sweet corn for a dessert
3,ive made corn casserole since discovering a recipe as a young newlywed from a church fundraising cookbook eons ago and it has been a great standby for many years as my kids grew i eventually quit making it some years back and now my youngest daughter who is now out in her own tries to make it the problem is that the industry has changed the cornbread mix formula and they just arent the same as the ones from back when when this recipe was really popular which is what prompted me to just stop making it corn pudding is a tried and true its todays mixes that can mess it up
3,it was ok i thought it was more of a potato and cheese soup versus a cheeseburger soup
3,i think i was looking for something extra special in this soup but it wasnt therequite a bit of work for something that tasted merely average
3,reading all the star reviews i thought this would be a slam dunk it was good but disappointing not what i expected i have another similar recipe thats the keeper so i will stick with that one
3,i will make into a cake next timedelicious
3,this soup was just average to me i think that if you like a stuffed pepper soup this is great but i tend to like a more creamy soup i probably wont make this again
3,made with ground turkey diced tomatoes with chilies omitted the salt and used cups rice
3,cake is tasty but worse icing ever both in taste and texture just threw the whole lot in the bin
3,i have made a wacky choccake for years and this has similar ingredientsbut i question that this recipe has only c of flour not c likel theacky cakei have not baked this cake because of the flour discrepancyare you sure it is c flour for the liquid sugarand cocoa amount it does not seem proportional to the liquids
3,although moist i didnt find it very flavorful maybe i didnt measure right
3,my husband and i enjoyed this soup i made a few changes to make it smaller since there are just the two of us ground beef can beef broth in place of water and boullion oz diced tomatoes and cooked instant white rice we had in pantry otherwise i made as listed and it was great much thicker the second day and was great with cornbread muffins
3,after further evaluation this recipe is bumped up to three stars to get it right you must cook the dish at lower temperature for a longer duration i found starting at for minutes and then dropping the temp to in a convection oven for minutes to be successful the cheese bechamel is still holding and the potatoes are cooked as far as i can tell using a toothpick to test the softness feel free to add your own touches to make this dish your own overall an kk recipe but it needs work to turnout properly
3,was tasty when it finally finished cooking but the time listed in the recipe was way off the potatoes were still hard after an hour and it took another half hour at before they were soft enough to eat
3,this was more of a soup to me maybe i will try again with an extra can of beans mashed to thicken needs a little more something but it is a great base to start with and make your own
3,my family found this soup ok but not one of our favorites will keep looking for a chicken chili recipe that hits the ball out of the park
3,came out really soupy next time would add chicken broth by only a fraction
3,i feel bad writing this because everyone else liked it so much but for my family it had no kick at all chili is suppose to have some kick right if you like your chili runny and bland then i guess this would be good
3,not impressed at all but much better than the last bean soup i made
3,although i dont luuuurve their delivery i agree with the other reviewers that this recipe could be cooked longer and could benefit from much more seasoning its tricky to find that perfect balance between firm and mushy potatoes but the recipe as followed yielded crunchy potatoes thus i increased the heat and the cooking time i used gruyère and white cheddar sautéed shallots and in addition to salt and pepper added my secret makeseveryrecipeamazing spice blend for flavor a href target_blank relnoopener i also sopped up the oil that rose to the top with a paper towel sprinkled the top with parmesan maybe overkill but if tons of cheese is wrong i dont want to be right and then broiled for a few moments before letting it sit
3,why would you cook potatoes for an hour and minutes
3,soup tasted great but it tasted nothing like a cheeseburger more like a cheesey potato soup with hamburger added
3,ok i substituted the buttermilk with milk and a tablespoon of lemon juice as directed in the tohcookbooks but the muffins didnt puff up as they should and collapsed somewhat at the end when still in the oven very strange perhaps substituting buttermilk was not such a good idea the taste however was ok
3,overall this soup turned out great my only issue was that the cups of water was not nearly enough liquid i ended up adding about double that amount i substituted beef broth for the water and it was a great addition i also only used black beans two cans and i used a whole bag of frozen corn instead of canned it was a huge hit with my whole family
3,thought it was not bad but not amazing either followed the recipe to a t
3,was not to impressed with this recipeall i could taste was the cream
3,ive made it with and without brown sugar and its much better without the sugar in my familys opinion
3,made this for dinner tonight and the gravy was super thick i wish i had stuck to my instincts and put about half the flour in it or maybe used cornstarch instead also with adding the milk its more like a cream gravy and i prefer a rich traditional chicken gravy not terrible but wont be a keeper for our house
3,this had great flavor but the mixture was too thick it was like pasty gravy may be just a personal preference that i like it more creamy therefore i will definitely use less butter and flour next time
3,my husband and i loved the taste of the pie but the texture was very runny even after refridgerating overnight it was still soupy and did not hold up when cut it didnt keep us from grabbing a spoon and devouring it though
3,was a bit too fluffyi prefer a more substantial pie but the taste was good
3,i made this key lime pie and it lacked some things wish i had added some lime juice to it and maybe cream cheese or something it just did not have the tangy taste i like in lemon pies
3,this is a very good potato soup recipe but not a pennsylvania dutch recipe thats the reason for the average rating pennsylvania dutch cooking doesnt have many ingredients potatoes milk or cream celery salt and pepper for protein sliced hard boiled eggs are the topper eggs and potatoes were abundant in the area
3,this cake was not moist at all i was very disappointed thickheavy and kinda hardi cooked it only minutes i liked the frostingthe cake had a good flavornot to sweet i couldt serve this until i could figure out what went wrong sorry
3,the consistency is much too loose to be considered chili will add cornstarch in order to thicken next time
3,my family says they did not enjoy this recipe but i thought it was mighty tasty my husband and two boys only ate a couple spoonfuls but i finished two bowls without a problem
3,it was ok since some commented it was more soup than chili i did add more chicken i didnt adjust any of the spices so maybe thats why it seemed a little bland even with the extra chicken there was way more onion than i ever care to have it reeked of onion when i lifted the lid maybe this is a good base to start off at but i wouldnt make it as written again
3,this dish was just okay for mevery good if youre looking to cook something on the lighter side
3,i did the standard flour then egg then bread crumb breading routine and the chicken turned out nice and moist as for the bruschetta topping i found the garlic to be a bit overpowering maybe because it was mostly raw i did appreciate the fresh tomatoes and basil
3,this was a great new way for us to enjoy chicken moist and lots of flavor i would definately make this dish again
3,loved the crust made it with brown sugar the filling wasnt very tasty added lime juice which helped a little will add more next time i make it my family loved it as is and ate all of it
3,
3,this recipe is at least years old nothing wrong with that from weight watchers it is very good but i agree with the first reviewer not a fan of cool whip and im not a fan of anything that is sugar free there are some funky ingredients in both cool whip and the sugar free jello
3,mom made these my entire unmarried life and ive made them for years using her recipe you have made it way to difficult its just hamburger onion egg rice mixed into balls put into a casserole dish mix cans tomato soup with water and pour over the meatballs i add a little red pepper flakes for spice and salt and pepper serve with more cooked rice or mashed potatoes with the sauce
3,this was one of my favorites as a child only my mom used tomato soup with dilution we also cook the meatballs right in the soup in an electric skillet if you allow the soup to thicken slightly and then add the meatballs they cook in the sauce with the added grease of the meat mixing in from the browning process
3,i just did not think it had much flavor
3,will not make this again it was good but did not get fluffy like the picture and did not get firm when refrigerated maybe because i used regular jello instead of sugar free
3,good recipe but use instant rice instead and dont add water to mixture i found using regular rice the rice doesnt cook thoroughly
3,i couldnt wait to try this soup due to the rave reviews except that is from the nutrition police it is a filling and tasty meal but i couldnt give it more than stars because to us it was just average i will probably make it again and maybe add more ground beef
3,never liked the sound of this until i tried it this recipe is a good starting point i almost always change things to my taste i have used leftover grilled cheeseburgers in this and the flavor that is added from the grilling was amazing also have used some smoked cheddar i had on hand or some spicy nacho cheese from a can i garish with your regular burger toppings tomatoes pickles a fried onions mushrooms great soup
3,my husband ate three bowlfuls amp indicated it was okay i substituted t potato starch for the flour used t better than boullion beef base amp shredded cheddar cheese with half and half amp milk
3,i prepared as directed it was a very heavy rich and filling soup i think if i make it again i would use a different cheese i wasnt a fan of the velveeta flavor it looked beautiful and my family liked it i thought it was just okay but ill try it again maybe with cheddar or colby cheddar mix
3,very good taste and easy to make however it wasnt quite the consistency it should have been for potato soup even though i added extra flour when i reheated it the potatoes turned mushy
3,made this yesterday if i make it again ill leave out the celery seed as it was a bit overpowering we like potato soup but hubby didnt eat as much as he usually does although he never complains
3,didnt turn out well if i ever make these again i will omit the water in the meatballs cause they fell apart i will also omit the sugar a little too sweet
3,the meat mixture was very soft and hard to form into balls not all of the rice wanted to stick and it many grains ended up in the sauce giving the sauce a thicker and chunkier texture i also thought that the finished product was very soft next time i would add some bread crumbs or an egg to give these meatballs some structure
3,made these for years but use tomato soup intead of tomatoe sauce
3,i only give a star because italian food should not be hoteliminated the red pepper flakes thank you very much otherwise simple easy and good oh ya used home grown tomatoes cooked down
3,i used mild italian sausage as i cant get turkey sausage where we live we found it salty and lacking flavour
3,very good i subtititued escarole for spinachexcellent
3,corrected review a half cup of flour per pie was too much it came out too gluey and dense i started over used a little less than a cup per pie and it turned out good thick enough to hold everything together but still creamy
3,first you have to like meatloaf
3,i made this bread for my daughter last night and we were both very impressed with its incredible moistness and heavenly taste thank you taste of home well be making this recipe as often as possible
3,after mixing marinate ingredients together i thought it was a bit bland so i added extra garlic and ginger also some hot pepper flakes and salt and it was a tasty terriaki style chicken id say it was about average but i really liked the boneless and skinless thighs
3,disappointing my family found it just ok nothing special there are better grilled chicken recipes out there
3,which is it ounces of cheese or cups help please
3,i made the bread following the directions the bread turned out well light and with a nice height however it tasted very bland to me wish i had added some cinnamon or nutmeg to give it some spunk
3,i like the recipe but i think it is too moist i made it with large bananas and felt it was going to be like soup i added a cup extra flour and it was still a little too moist for me but my guests said it was very good and didnt know it was gf also i mixed the nuts in
3,i hate to be the only one to not be satisfied with this recipe but it did not turn out it was extremely dense so dense in fact that it was raw and runny in the middle and almost burnt on the outside after an hour in the oven i have no clue what i did wrong i got it to the point of edible in the middle i even made a test batch and added more flower because that was slightly too wet i think it would do best as two small loaves it had a great flavor though and the outside is wonderful i need help to make this right
3,sorry but there are more delish way to pack on grams of fat and over a days worth of sodinm into a singl serving some sodium can be cut by reducing celery who knew it is l is loaded w sodium velveta is tasty but most of fat and salt cone from here i need to look further for another recipe
3,i used bread crumbs instead of oats bc thats what i had in the pantry i took aliciachapas advice and baked it at for another min i also added some bacon strips on top it was good but not amazing as other recipes ive tried ill make it again when i need something fast
3,substituted cucumber for zucchiniworks wellsubstituted c splenda blend for sugarnot a moist cupcakefrosting required c confectioners sugar for spreading consistencyanything less would create glaze consistency
3,just made these for dinner made them exactly as the recipe states i was really disappointed with them after reading all the great reviews they were bland and the amount of ingredients didnt seem proportional to one pound of beef out of adults none of us liked it i threw out the leftovers
3,not sure what all the star reviews are about i was disappointed my husband liked this because it was spicy my kids and i did not i had to make a second dinner for them after they begged not to eat it it will give you lots of gas too
3,while i think these would be fun for kids as the meatballs do take on a fun spiky porcupine look as you cook them i only found them ok in taste i think next time i would still make the meatballs with the rice but try a different recipe for the sauce
3,way too much liquid for the topping turned out mushy and too sweet i would try it again using half the topping
3,for my taste it was extremely sweet it may be a good recipe if the sugar was cut in half
3,i was really excited about this but after spending much time on it i was disappointed as it seemed bland except for the fact that there was way too much of a thyme taste next time ill cut the thyme and add other seasonings
3,im totally confused by everyone who loved this recipe i halved it because i was making one pie i found the cup of flour way too much for thickening i had to thin it using additional milk and broth which threw me off i then needed additional salt and pepper when i realized how thick my sauce was i looked at other recipes for the amount of liquid i used cup of flour is appropriate im certain i measured correctly my flour was all purpose it was fine after the adjustment
3,not sure how this received so many positive comments i made recipe as written and it resulted in a very thick and gummy sauce it is far too much flour in this recipe if i make it again ill cut flour in half
3,the caramel frosting is absolutely outstanding the cupcakes themselves however were just okay and really tasted more like a muffin than a cupcake i have a chocolate cake with caramel frosting recipe that is really good and id make that in cupcake liners before id ever make this again
3,it was okay but way too thin of a soup for my liking i eliminated the additional c of liquid called for near the end and added another can of cream of mushroom soup and a c of minute rice to thicken it up
3,way too much liquid i eliminated the last cup of liquid and it was still too thin thickened it up a bit with additional flour amp water slurry prepare all vegies and ingredients ahead of time prep goes fairly fast once it starts
3,ive tried to make soup twice a week this winter amp have tried different recipes so have many to compare this to my only change was to add cloves garlic it was too thin for my taste so after trying it i added cup barley amp recooked the soup until the garlic was done much better it also needed salt amp pepper
3,would this work as well with chicken breasts
3,perfect
3,just ok these were a bit dense i should have realized from the batter that it needed more milk perhaps cup would have been a better ratio i usually use the martha stewart recipe i also would suggest adding tsp vanilla
3,the batter is very thin following this recipe and ladle size that batter will just spread and spread in the pan my first pancake was basically a crepe i wasnt using a huge pan had to add more flour to the recipe so eventually it wound up okay but i had to play with it first
3,the thyme overpowered the taste of this pie otherwise it should have been fine a lot of steps to have the one seasoning throw it off
3,good flavor a little too sweet needs more peaches
3,i think the difference in results may be due to how ripe the peaches may have been lots of juice as you slice cut the extra fluid down accordingly
3,tasty
3,the flavor was very good however it was so saucy that it made me think it was not done i think id cut in half the topping mixture
3,i liked the fact that it was small as for the recipe i cut the water in half and used half white half brow sugar with the peaches i wild have liked the top to have been more crisp
3,if i made this again i would reduce the butter by half it was too greasy for me taste was ok but not good enough to make again
3,for some reason i thought it said cups flour i was wondering why i had to double that aside from me reading directions wrong its a fantasic basic recipe i would say add a tiny bit of spice to the water before mixing i added a pinch of garlic salt onion powder and italian season and just wow such a small amount of spice can go a very long ways
3,these cupcakes were bland the frosting too sweet they taste more like muffins instead of cupcakes
3,the cook time at the top doesnt match the bottom an additional minutes was not built into my planning time ill be eating at pm cant let you know how it is until thenoh wait i just reread this after reading several reviews and finding one that mentions time thats the frozen pie option time to take it out of the oven
3,scale of ease of prep super easy just toss in a bowl and mixcooking time its about average for breadstexture still a little fluffier than i like but the crust isnt as flakymoisture has enough that i didnt feel like a slice needed some kind of spreadflavor sweeter than i like less sugar next time
3,just okay too much cheese and i even added plenty of extra broth
3,im gonna make this again but definitely with adjustments no celery its extremely distracting ill also be adding chopped pickles ive had another cheeseburger soup recipe that had them and it was delicious who knew right leave out the basil it makes this taste like a spaghetti sauce gone wrong lastly a whole pound of velveeta really id cut that to about of that garnish with cheddar if ya want more cheese
3,i tried this recipe todaytime consumingthe big problem i faced was one cooled and cut the top layer was sliding off the rest of the bar also the photo on the recipe shows the bar having a carmeal color and mine has a chocolate colored toppinghelp please i want to try this againthis bar is very tasy but with the top sliding off its not what i can serve
3,this recipe was ok but i had a problem keeping the caramel firm the warmer if got the more it melted i think next time i would use a more firmer caramel recipe ie sweetened condensed milk
3,tastes good enough a lot of steps my family just wasnt a big fan
3,i thought the sauce was delicious i used bonein chicken breasts because i dont really like thighs and i think this was a mistake i did not really care for the texture of the breast meat cooked this way i would strongly recommend sticking with thighs
3,smells awesome cant wait to try it thats was great i tripled the recipe so there was decent amount of sauce i think boneless would end up dry just dont eat the skin
3,i want my bread to look like the one in the picture mine wasnt golden brown but ill try it again
3,why does the ingredient list say cups of flour but they only tell you to put into the dough plus some extra i put in a little extra to make the dough not stick but that was no where near cups total i hope im not making this bread all wrong please fix the directions
3,sorry toh but these were not very good i love horseradish but it does not belong in these sliders the brown sugar also does not belong with horseradish
3,this sounds really good and i havent made it yet however with that been horseradish sauce is a lot different than prepared horseradish prepared is a lot stronger than the sauce you can mix the prepared with the mayo and it would be the same thing as the sauce
3,ill be the first to admit that i have a sweet tooth ive never met a candy i havent liked but this meal was too sweet if the brown sugar was omitted that would cut back on the sweetness id definitely make it again without the brown sugar
3,these were ok couldnt really taste the main ingredients with all the highly flavored condiments and for some reason mine came out very soggyick
3,sorry but the recipe is wrong for those above sea level reason is not enough water which will evaporate the ratio should be cup of water to cups of flour per loaf of bread oil can be higher ratio the bread when it rises will create its own heat so if you have dry flower that is why change the ratio of water to flower for number of loafs
3,do you need to let the yeast wake up before you start mixing in the remaining yeast
3,the flavor is good but the textureconsistency of the dressing is too thick coleslaw dressing is typically more drippy or runny since this is a mayonnaisesour cream base its the same base thats used in veggie or chip dips thick this recipe will do until i find a more traditional one
3,we thought it was rather bland for leftovers i add some shredded cheddar cheese amp that improved the flavor a little needs celery seed green pepper onion or some other addins
3,good coleslaw but nothing fantastic a lot of cholesterol and fat in one serving i prefer my old recipe with apple cider vinegar instead easy to make if time is tight i substituted freshly cut cabbage and carrot instead of slaw mix
3,i followed the recipe and did not like the flavor my true test whether to make a recipe again is ask the family how they liked it when they reply it was ok that translates to me as dont make again i really did want to like this recipesorry
3,the bar itself was nice and moist it had great flavor i was disappointed with the frosting there wasnt enough fir good coverage of the pan and it didnt stick to the bar next time i will buy a can of frosting expected better from taste of home
3,nice effort for the recipe lilliamarai try the real asian version just a little twist from this recepiuse lime juice tblspoon instead of orange juice ommit tomato sauce substitude with tamarind juice tblspoon if you did not use lime juice at all before you fry the chicken with corn oil oat it with teaspoon of tumeric powder teaspoon of salt when chicken is done scoop out the chicken use the same oil to cook the sauce remember to season the sauce with salt amp sugar up to you put the chicken into the sauce and stir a while the sauce should be sweet amp spicy there are many version of asian style this is one of the simple ones hope youll enjoy asian food
3,i thought we would love this and was surprised that we didnt the chicken was moist and well cooked in the stated time but the sauce was too sweet and the consistency of it was very unappealing i will probably not make this again
3,this recipe has potential but some flaws that keep it from being stars first as for taste it is good but for my family possibly too sweet for clarity i did take the advice of other reviewers and use light brown sugar instead of white which i think is essential if you want a true teriyaki flavor however the sugar definitely needs to be adjusted and cut down second i also had the same problem as other reviewers in not being able to get the sauce to properly thicken as expected there was just too much of if and i used a little over three pounds of chicken thighs i served it with rice and there was plenty of sauce to go round and then some finally the cook time is way off luckily i had read the reviews and noted this issue my chicken was done at hours so i moved the crockpot setting over to warm if you cook this the full time stated in the recipe you will get overdone dry chicken as i mentioned this recipe as potential but could use some tweaking
3,easy recipe but needs some help i will try using brown sugar and adding more ginger chicken was a bit dry
3,i didnt like the sauce i might try it again using brown sugar
3,i wanted very much to like this soup but it is just too bland for my taste even with adding more cheese and hot sauce it is bland i think it definitely needs onion along with the carrots and celery
3,this is not a review per se but a question to those bakers that have made this bread when i eat it the first day it is made its very good however it gets terribly dry after the first cuts and then it just does not taste as flavorful as that first slice within a day or so after being made it is dry and very sad tasting does anyone else have this same thing happen i love the the easiness of this recipe and hope there are some suggestions on how i might get the moist taste you get from some of the store bought white breads
3,does anyone proofread these recipes direction says to put ing in a bowl then bring to a boil
3,i just made this recipe again and some of it stuck to the glass pan i just read a review that said to use shortening and not the spray i will definitely do that next time the card players should love this surprise treat i would give it a star rating this time
3,this was just to sweet for my taste and i only added a tbsp of sugar started over and deleted the sugar and added lime juice for some tang it tasted great after those adjustments
3,needs more flavor next time i would add finely diced green pepper and sliced green onions also red wine vinegar in the dressing a tsp or
3,good basic cake but i dont care for oily foods so i added another cup of pumpkin and only a cup of butter as we all knoweverything is better with butter i also added a tsp of vanilla tspnutmeg dash of ground cloves if you use a x pan its a bar andmight want to check prior to the bake time stated x pan is a cakeamp will take longer to bake since its thicker remember you shouldonly take bake times stated as a estimate of time needed rule ofthumb every oven is differentand tooth picks never liealways check it a little earlier then time called for say to minutesand lastly think about what ratio is called for in a recipe before youstart mixing it you can catch misprints etc before its in the ovenand to late to fix if you think about what youre mixing
3,we added tsp of pumpkin spice the cake came out very greasy so we wonder about putting full cup into the recipe we used canned frosting and it definitely improved the flavor overall the cake was good but we wouldnt make it again
3,a pretty good recipe but i thought it needed some help the mirepoix makes a real difference to the full flavor of the soup but i did not care for their noticable presence in the finished product solution i pureed them once fully cooked with cup of beef broth that is a second change i made beef not chicken broth for all of the obvious reasons for me a cheesebuger always includes sliced tomato so that brought me to my third modification ounce can of diced tomatoes with juices my fourth change was to use a full pound of ground beef i also used the pan drippings to cook the mirepoix which contributes greatly to the meaty flavor of the soup to keep the cooked ground beef moist amp tender i did not return it to the pot until the potatoes were almost done the mirepox puree eliminates the need for the roux to thicken the soup i used the combination of the puree and the starch from the cooked potatoes to create a creamy base for the soup as the cheese melted rather than velveeta which contributes too much salt to the soup i used ounces of cream cheese and ounces of sharp cheddar use the cheese you best like on you cheeseburger the cream cheese also helps with the emulsification of the sauce and made the sour cream unnecessary i finished with salt amp pepper to taste along with a generous teaspoon of dry mustard after all what is a cheeseburger without ketchup the tomatoes and mustard while i made a number of changes that i prefer to this soup i would not have thought of a cheeseburger soup with out this for inspiration
3,this was okay it is very heavy and i wont make it again it tastes like a bowl of queso
3,gt i used to work the salad bar at ryans we used the simple ingredients buttermilk mayo sugar mixed together and poured across the cole slaw mixture we used this combo dressing for many of the other fruit salads and broccoli amp cauliflower salad amp carrot and raisin salad when making dressing cup buttermilk cup mayo kraft or dukes or sauers and cup of sugar no salt is added u get to do that u eat it
3,while this looks yummy its not the easiest by far this one is very easy and delicious c sugar c milk t vanilla extract c peanut butter bring sugar
3,made just as recipe written both my husband and i thought it had a grainy texture tasted ok probably will not make again must admit that it was very easy to make
3,too sweet for me not enough peanut butter taste
3,i was a bit disappointed because of the outstanding reviews the ingredients werent anything special and that is what i got my changes were that i precooked the cauliflower by roasting it before adding it to the broth after the other vegetables were cooked i also used the smokey hot sauce for more flavor i will be doctoring the leftovers as i serve it
3,i did think the soup was a little on the bland side so i added some onion powder that that seemed to help i also added a bit more flour because i like a thicker soup and i thought this was on the thin side i do have to say it was very easy to make
3,question how does the baking instructions change after you freeze the pie
3,havent made this recipe yet but want to try it kj if you cant have much dairy try your health food store for soy cheeses and ask your grocer to carry soy milk
3,this tastes good but i greased the pan and the bread would not come out of pan so i lost the entire bottom of the bread
3,can the cup of oil be substituted with applesauce it seems like a lot of oil
3,can the cup oil be substituted with applesauce ive heard of the substitution in other recipes
3,why does everything have to have a spicy kick there are tons of people who cannot tolerate this the same goes for the tv food channels
3,this soup is good but my family prefers a different cheeseburger soup recipe that ive adapted from taste of home for us this just lacked something but we liked the mushrooms i will probably add mushrooms to the my cheeseburger soup
3,this was a good recipe because my family liked it i guess i didnt care for it too much because it was so thick it almost has too much cheese in it is there such a thing so i would suggest maybe making it with extra beef broth or bouillon cubes and water and topping it with cheese for my personal tastes anyway
3,good soup needs zip
3,not sure what i did wrong the fudge didnt set up it taste great anyone with ideas on how to salvage this
3,nothing really wrong with it just not something that we loved
3,i did not find this to be anything special a macaroni salad with bacon mixed in never got a sense of a blt due to the high volume of mayo should have followed my instincts and dropped that additional cup dont regret making but have no intentions of doing so again
3,i am eating leftover soup and just realized whats missing it needs a pinch of dry mustard
3,this recipe is a place to start hard to imagine how boring it would be as written we roasted the vegetables added sauteed onion and a list of seasonings onion powder basil marjoram white pepper paprika and made it a little thicker and it was very good
3,i followed directions it tastes very bland very disappointed
3,its still in the oven but am i the only one who thought there wasnt enough meat mixture in one cup to cover the bottom of the x baking dish
3,super salty next time i will not add the salt the recipe calls for and ill also use no salt added tomato sauce and paste i think minus the over salty taste this would be really good
3,i feel kind of bad being the only one so far to really think this cheesecake wasnt that amazing i think i was expecting more of the peanut butter cup taste all through out it and it wasnt really what i was looking for i wouldnt mind trying it again but instead of putting the peanutbutter on the bottom fold it into the cream cheese filling or both im just not a big fan of plain cheesecake and this was more plain tasting than i would like
3,it tasted good but needs some alterations for starters it wasnt very soupy and could use either some water or another can of chicken broth good starter recipe that could be great with some improvements
3,i have another ginger cookie recipe that i love but decided to try these from all the reviews these use less molasses and smaller amounts of spices so therefore they were flat tasting to me i use cup molasses and tof spices will return to my old recipe also my recipe makes doz cups flour
3,easy and good the dumplings were not gooey even my picky eater ate some
3,please give high altitude adjustments many of us live above feet they come out flat i want big fluffy cookies please give high altitude adjustments for this an all your recipes
3,i need a lesser quanitytherefore ill need to divide the recipe starsi think i want to try a nippy cheese instead of a velveeta
3,anyone know how to make this a slow cooker recipe
3,i just finished making this soup and i believe it has potential i did follow the recipe however for my personal preference this soup needs more flavor the beef flavor and velveeta are not enough to increase the saltiness perhaps just simply seasoning the ground beef while cooking will be enough i am going to make this again and experiment
3,i am still in the process of making this so my star rating is not really fair however i am confused i went out yesterday and carefully selected all of the ingredients if you look at the ingredients list there is no mention of provolone then when you get to step you are supposed to layer with provolone provolone is similar to mozzarella but the instructions call for provolone and mozzarella note the recipe also calls for c of parmesan cheese no where in the instructions is that ingredient mentioned finally the sauce is to be simmered for one hour unless you want it burned dont plan on that it is very thick and i had to stop with nine minutes to go obviously this recipe was not kitchentested
3,this was pretty bland i had added diced chicken breasts and extra black pepper amp even some korean chili powder but that was not enough what really helped was sprinkling some green onions over the top of the soup after serving
3,i added some bacon drippings and made miracle whip part of the dressing along with the mayo and yet the flavor was still bland to me i then doctored it up with more salt and some cajun seasoning and only then did the salad have presence enough for my familys tastes i will keep this in my recipe box with notes added for the above alterations
3,i loved the ingredients but decided to add a few other veggies i used green pepper and seeded cucumbers the dressing in the recipe was not to the familys liking and i did not use it n the salad i substituted hidden valley buttermilk ranch dressing and the kids declared it a success
3,there was too much mayonnaise
3,very good recipe but not enough spice very blandtoo many noodles left over and not enough ricotta sauce to fill last layer i dont make lasagna so i followed the recipe exactly as it said
3,pat milo try it with real mozzarella and ricotta cottage cheese cannot compare you can leave out the meat we like it without meat
3,this was pretty simple to make what i found i didnt care for was the filling that went into the apples the white sugarcornstarchwatermelted butter left an odd flavor bland and odd at the same time maybe instead of white sugar i would use brown sugar with some spices such as cinnamon maybe some nutmeg
3,i really liked this cheesecake but it is very rich its not real great for after a big meal but it is delicious if you have an empty stomach
3,this was very easy and very tasty i had always used biscuits cut in fourths for dumplings these were much better followed recipe except didnt add carrots personal preference
3,boy i made this and it was an epic fail not sure what went wrong with all the star rating i must have really done something wrong although i can not figure out what it was the pecans on top definitely burnt as was warned but also the sides and bottom really burnt yet there was a thick layer near the bottom that was soggy and unbaked i must get a oven thermometer to check my temperatures what was edible was yummy
3,i didnt think this recipe was great or outstanding it wasnt real moist maybe i needed to put another banana just okay
3,just an ok recipe to me a rather heavy bread not light like most of my quick bread recipes are also way too many nuts for my taste will return to my go to banana nut recipe
3,i might try this again it tastes very good but did not come out of the pan after the minute wait the top broke off and the rest was stuck they were x nonstick pans that i greased never had this happen before and i make many different banana breads any suggestions would be appreciated it is a very good tasting bread should it have been pans the batter filled up pans thanks
3,i might be in the minority but this cheesecake was not as good as i thought it would be i am confused by the name because it tastes nothing like a peanut butter cup the peanut butter flavor is hardly evident and the fudge poured on top doesnt add much to the flavor except for the pb cups for garnishes where is the comparison to a pb cup the crust came out hard too and i didnt overbake it i just was not thrilled with this cheesecake its not worth all the trouble so i dont think i would bother making it again
3,i saw that this was one of the best rated casseroles so it inspired me to try it it wasnt anything to really rave about and i wouldnt make it again unless i added something like sausage maybe that would be better it tasted kind of bland to me needed some spices to taste like pizza
3,actually tastes even better the next day as a leftover
3,the name should have given it away but this makes a sweet pancake too sweet for me which im pretty sure is the first time ive ever said that it is tasty though i cooked on a low heat but the pancakes stuck to the nonstick griddle because of the high amount of sugar if i made again i would reduce the sugar on the flip side see what i did there you dont need much syrup or jam to top them
3,this had very little flavor amp too many green chilies
3,the flavor of this chili is excellent i would mention that it could have been a bit thicker not so runny and i used chicken thigh meat instead which made the bites of meat super tender
3,my family loved this but i did make changes i used bulk italian sausage instead of ground beef and pizza sauce instead of tomato sauce i dont think it would have tasted like pizza otherwise the crust had to be baked longer than recommended and the zucchini needed more time in the colander to draw out the moisture knowing this now and making those changes i will be making it again
3,i have done it and i am not so happy it has called a lot of butter and flour so it has strong flour taste and very rich
3,personally i thought the onions were too sweet and the flavors didnt really go together on the other hand my husband really liked it and urged me to make it again
3,made this recipe in the crock pot it was ok but the pork chops were bland it needs something to flavor the meat more i will try it in the oven next time if not better then will not make again
3,we really enjoyed this make sure your pork chops have a little fat on them
3,i had a beautiful pan of dumplings turned off the heat and went to get our plates and not a dumpling in sight they all fell and turned into hard lumps of dough i dont know what happened was trying something new for my hubby and didnt turn out
3,while the pie was quick to put together it just tasted sort of blah i will make this again but will add spices to the filling as written the filling has a strange sweet jelly texture that lacks interest
3,this pie was easy to put together but very sweet it seemed to be missed something so next time i will add cinnamon and nutmeg as other readers suggested it has a lot of potential and i loved the crust
3,something is off with the filling wonderful crust and topping though
3,very simple recipe that results in a sweet amp crowdpleasing dessert after an initial tasting there wasnt enough flavor for my households taste so we added tsp ginger tsp nutmeg tsp cinnamon and tbs lemon juice to the filling overall i loved how simple this recipe was and it was a great base to add an applepie spice mixture to all the roommates enjoyed it
3,what would happen if you cut the salt
3,i was just wondering what would happen as another lady thought it was too much i am going to try this recepie anyway
3,the dish was easy to make and the flavor was good however the chicken was rather dry i feel like it should have been cooked for a little less time
3,this was bland and disappointing
3,i think this sounds good but the pizza influence is not there namely the seasonings in real pizza sauce basil oregano garlic salt and black pepper a can of paste added to the sauce simmer until it bubbles like the old mud pots at disneyland top the zucchini layer with sauce top with hamburger veg and cheese and that should bring this home ive been making pizza for years trust me this works otherwise its a great recipe and the zucchini rocks love keto
3,it was okay my husband really liked it but me and the kids didnt i wont make it again but i must say the italian dressing went well in it
3,this was ok it was not amazing and nothing really special i may make it again and i may not we all thought is was ok
3,it was just okay
3,the gravy was blandno flavor i added some sharp cheddar to the broth mixture and it made it much tastier more like a scalloped potato
3,im thinking hour is too long to cook these chops i think i would just brown the chops and put them on top of my scalloped potatoes that have been in the oven for awhile and let everything finish at the same time
3,this was good not great
3,decided to make this recipe and read reviews prior to making iti doubled the gravyeverything came out so tender but it was so so so bland even with extra seasoning to gravy and pork chops not sure ill make this again
3,so many of the recipes are on the presumption that everyone has a large family i am only person so these dont benefit me
3,good and easy to make
3,i rated this good because the topping and the crust were good because it was different but there was to much sugar in this recipe so i will try it again with less sugar
3,i really thought this was going to be better based on all the other reviews maybe it was the kind of black beans i used or the type of italian dressing but my family didnt love it i may try this one again just because i love anything with tomatoes or cilantro
3,i was so looking forward to trying this recipe but i mustve done something wrong it did not turn out at all and there were definitely no distinct layers as shown in the photo im not sure what happened
3,this was pretty good i do have one complaint though the bottom tortillas were hard i think next time i am going to put a really thin layer of salsa or something at the bottom so the shells will not be rock
3,i thought this recipe was very easy to make i liked it but not for tacos i use it as a topping for big tostada bowls
3,i liked it but my husband and son did not i think the three layers of tortillas made it hard to cut through and the leftovers were soggy
3,use corn tortillas for a real enchilada texture flour tortillas get soggy
3,i added asparagus and thyme and upped the salt and pepper i like it but think it needs more flavor next time i might add some sherry
3,half and half is not cream its half milk and half light cream you could get the same effect with cup milk and cup light cream that said this recipe is not very flavorful it needed garlic for a start and one commenter suggested adding some sherryany white wine would help i added a couple of quick grates of nutmegbe careful not to overdo this as a tiny bit goes a long way a little bit of thyme would be a good idea too i added a dash of tabasco maybe to of a tspnot enough to add any heat but it did help to open up the flavor
3,i liked it but my husband didnt so i am only giving it stars
3,i used a combination of ground beef and italian sausage omitted the salt doubled the oregano and used regular lasagna noodles the filling tasted good but the noodles turned out with a weird hardtodescribe consistency like chewy cheese or mushy noodles in the future i think ill just make it in the oven
3,i make my scalloped potatoes with cream of mushroom or a cream soup of any kind i cut the soup with can milk the soup gives it much flavor and no need to make a white sauce its a lot easier and delicious
3,i didnt make any changes and found this recipe using one sliced onion would have been much better with less onion
3,i made this yesterday and it tasted ok but was denser than i thought it should be i did use frozen blueberries so that made of made a difference not a repeat at our house
3,this was not a big hit with my family i think it tries to be three different breads and doesnt succeed with any of them
3,i am rating this as a three because i was trying different lemon blueberry recipes and this one just doesnt deserve the stars my family did enjoy the bread it was the first recipe i tried out someone else mentioned this comment and i fully agree after making a different recipe the bread is actually too heavy nice flavor but sits heavy and feels heavy the biggest difference between this recipe and another i tried was how many eggs the other recipe i really liked took eggs i may have said i would make this again but not anymore
3,okay but probably wont make again
3,i dont care for mushrooms but my husband and especially my daughter loves them we had some mushrooms that needed to be used up before they went bad so i made this soup i did add in some of the suggestions in the comments they liked it they said it was just like campbells cream of mushroom but with more mushrooms well at least theyll eat the leftovers
3,i made this today
3,definitely add some thyme to the onion mushroom while sauteing stir in a bit of sherry and then the flour before the broth no flour needed if blending all in a food processor no salt if using salted butter and salted chicken broth
3,something changed i came back here to get a reminder of how to make it and halfandhalf is on the recipe doubted my memory and used the half and half it was so unremarkably bland and thin heavy cream makes all the difference in the world possibly this recipe was tweaked since i saved it would rate it stars asis fine for a way to use up mushrooms but nothing i would serve for a special meal use the original heavy cream if you want starsprevious review i am trying to let the soup finish cooking but cant help stealing spoonfuls while it is on the stove i think ingredient types are key here to get the flavor right the mushrooms cant be plain white mushrooms their flavor is half the taste i used crimean but would have loved to use portabellababy bellas i also used sweet onions peruvian i cannot imagine using white or yellow with this admittedly i fudged and used a whole onion since this is going to be a base for my green bean casserole and it has plenty of onion flavor in it also at the suggestion of a friend i added a roux accidently made it very dark but the toasted flavor was perfect my chicken stock was from a rotisserie chicken and so i omitted salt and pepper simply amazing
3,i change out black beans for pinto beans and omitted the clintro as we dont care for it
3,absolutely lovely chicken fajitas are one of my all time favorite but grams of carbs is days of carbs for me so its out of my eating range
3,easy like the ingredients ok taste
3,i made this pie the taste was excellent but it was so runny i went back through recipe to see if i missed anything but i hadnt any idea why the apples were soft but still in shape
3,followed the recipe word for word i let the pie cool over night but it was runny the flavor was great though guess i should have listened to other reviews and added extra flour
3,may i request the complete recipe for the double crust
3,potatoes great chops just ok
3,recipe is good but the directions suck they lump three or four different steps into one step so youre constantly back and forth between ingredients and directions trying to remember where youre at
3,after i started making this i began to wonder why all the work just to put it in a crock pot it did taste okay but i think i will stick with making lasagna and then baking it in the oven
3,get rid of the cottage cheese super gross use ricotta instead
3,first time ever making lasagna i thought the recipe was pretty good however i thought it was way too saltyill make it again but will definitely cut down on the salt other than that the family loved it
3,lots of great cooks here thanks for the tips made this last night and it rocked i used low fat everything including turkey sausage rinsed in hot water i would cut down some on the liquid even after sitting for hr it was a bit runny other than that five stars this review wont let me change to five from three
3,this soup didnt remind me of a cheeseburger in any way shape or form the potatoes just didnt seem to belong i did like the cheesy broth and if i make it again will leave out the potatoes and add either broccoli with bacon or macaroni
3,i cant jump for joy for this bread taste is excellent i live at sea level ive made this twice mine does not rise as well as the photo not a fluffygrainy bread i think the suggested oven temp is too hot i used frozen blueberries both times i recommend halfcup of berries also fresh blueberries would probably bleed less i did toss the berries in a tablespoon of flour old folks idea to keep berries from sinking but the glaze is totally wrong use confectioners sugar this version is a useless syrup
3,i am on the fence with this one it was alright nothing to write home about
3,it was a little too creamy for me
3,giving it a few extra stars only for a change i had to makemy rice noodles looked a lot different than in the video and i think that made a huge difference unfortunately
3,this was ok mine had no sauce either next time id add more garlic more spicei added that
3,i liked the overall recipe i used bagged precut coleslaw mix and the cabbage seamed to really break down next time i would buy a head of cabbage and slice it i also used chicken instead of pork i would also make additional sauce the next time i make it
3,recipe is nice it taste great but the filling is very liquidy and came out like soup even after cooking longer and resting for an hour was disappointed but taste great
3,way too much ginger and nutmeg in this recipe i even had more apples than called for and it was overpowering cut back the cinnamon and just add a pinch of the nutmeg and ginger let the apples be the hero
3,i marinated the chicken a full day and it seemed to be missing something we happen to like a little more spice i agree with other reviewers that it might be better with lime but i didnt have any i probably wont use this recipe again
3,i like the conceptbut it is under seasoned if i make again i would double the seasonings swap freshly grated ginger for the ground ginger and add a zap of siracha for a little heat the half pound of ground pork vs the volume of veggies is way off either leave the pork out or double it
3,family didnt care for it i thought it was just okay wont make again
4,this is a very good cake for potlucks amp large gatherings i make it in a x pan i use cream cheese frosting instead of butter cream and i decorate with fresh strawberry halves
4,the cake is wonderful the frosting is a mess next time i will make cream cheese or buttercream frosting and add diced strawberries to it to it
4,this cake taste great super moist only thing is that the juice from strawberries adds to the liquid in the batter so it was a tad bit messy its ok i covered it with the frosting lol i made this cake for my sisterinlaws bday i only used cake recipe because i made a chocolatecovered strawberries cake i made a chocolate pudding filling with left over strawberries the frosting i made a cocoa whipped cream one then placed almonds on the side of the cake
4,delicious if you like a mild chilli taste this is for you really would recommend making it
4,family really liked these but im not a fajita fan so it only gets four stars
4,these were really good i had a few options for everyone they chose a tortilla tortilla chips or rice to spoon this mixture over great either way
4,we dont eat much mexican food but i tried this recipe it was quite good i used olive oil instead of the oil listed and eliminated the cumin chile powder and red pepper flakes i would make this again thanks
4,we did enjoy the fajitas but i like it better with lime as opposed to lemon and i add a sauce for a little extra zip
4,havent tried yet
4,very tasty lots of flavor and i only marinated about an hour
4,i added some rice and avacado to my fajita it was delicious
4,it was so good my husband love it toomrs sandra elena smith
4,i make these all the time but made a few changes from the first time i made them i felt they were a little bland so i revamped the seasoning to tsp of cumin and tsp of garlic powder and replaced the green onions with sliced red onions and peppers the color of the peppers depends on what i have on handtry yellow and orange peppers too if you want to get rid of the after eating peppers burps try this after slicing your peppers in strips soak in water for a few minutes and then drying your peppers with a paper towel then cooking i can almost guarantee you wont be burping peppers all night
4,this was my first attempt at a white chili and was a little disappointed i added oz of cream cheese instead of the sour cream and didnt like the resulting flavor should have followed the recipe i will tinker with this some more but all in all a very easy quick recipe
4,deliciously delicious i will say the first time i made it it definitely bit my sweet tooth the second time i made it with sugar free jello and it brought some of the sweetness out as for the frostinggood when chilled melts super easily but is very yummy im playing around with the frosting recipe to see if adding a premade frosting or cream cheese will help it hold other than that yummers
4,for those having trouble with the cake not baking properly its probably due to the fact that boxed cake mixes have gotten smaller since this recipe was first published in try reducing the water by a quarter cup or the strawberries by a quarter cup some experimenting may be needed to get the proper ratio
4,practically the same recipe as ours i wonder why she put in extra flour and sugar we dont also i use eggs
4,cake is very good but will fall due to the weight of the strawberries this icing recipe is extremely sweet and doesnt set up so next time i will use a frosting recipe with cream cheese
4,i made this cake for the fourth of july in a sheet pan because i wanted to decorate it with blueberries and raspberries for the american flag everyone loved it instead of chopping the strawberries for the cake i just pureed them in the blender and i made cream cheese frosting because i needed the cake to be white for the flag decoration the cake is sweet so the cream cheese frosting definitely offsets that and really goes great with the strawberry flavor
4,i made this for the first time today and it will definitely be part of our rotation i used jars of prego pasta sauce with mushrooms and did half hamburger and half sausage and tripled the garlic i omitted the parm cheese and used ricotta instead of cottage cheese as i didnt have any and only used cup water and no bake noodles i found that hours on low was the perfect timethey were a little overdone at hours next time i will use more spice and maybe spicy sausage also i think this would be good with some mushrooms
4,i would recommend more spice oregano and basil
4,as stated before additional spices really make this recipe exceptional i used ricotta with great results using same amount only four stars because needed just a couple modifications try thiswonderful and easy
4,mmmmyum i enjoyed making and eating this but it wasnt really somthing to remeber
4,can refrigerated or frozen potatoes be used
4,i made this according to recipe except sprinkled lawrys on the chops baked the potatoes and onions covered for minutes then added pork chops and baked uncovered for minutes pretty good
4,the potatoes were amazing but the chops were a bit dry next time i may try adding a lemon or lime flavor to it to spice it up a bit
4,very quick and easy we actually had to eat this the day after due to a change in our plans and it was still very good
4,made as reciept said next time will use crushed tomatoes instead gives better flavor
4,this was good i used a oz can of pasta sauce and then added oz of tomato sauce instead of the oz tomato sauce i also used ricotta cheese in place of the cottage cheese as we prefer ricotta i served it with french bread and a tossed green salad
4,this is delicious and i make it all the time i use italian sausage instead of ground beef ricotta instead of cottage cheese and spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce oh and a lot more garlic than the recipe calls for and i omit the parmesan one thing that ive found is that it helps to use the crock pot liners when cooking thiswhen i dont use a liner the noodles get a little burnt around the edges but its perfect when using a linermy husband raves about this too
4,i love this bread if you dont want your blueberries to sink freeze them first as i do i use mini pans and bake for minutes i havent tried the glaze yet because for me its just right as is
4,this lemon blueberry bread was very good the best way mom and i can describe the taste is like blueberry fruitcake lol without all the candied fruit it has a moist dense texture i used granulated sugar in the glaze i see some reviewers used confectioners sugar the sweetness was perfect use fresh lemons for best results
4,what kind of bread pan are you using glass or metal i used glass and didnt adjust anything and it got too dark on the outside before it fully cooked had a good taste minus the dark outside
4,love this recipe had to make some adjustments no nuts but it turned out fantastic
4,four stars for taste one star deducted for the instruction to use an x pan it was too small and batter bubbled over it also the top browned quickly but that was mitigated by putting a piece of foil over top unfortunately the bread was still gooey underneath even after minutes so i scooped it into plates and microwaved it to firm it up my hubby isnt a big sweets eater but he really really liked this i left out the nuts because i dont like nuts in baked goods next time i make this i will only use a x pan and hope for better results
4,i made this this afternoon for the first time the taste is delicious but the bread looked pale on top gas oven on convection at for mins the recipe called for a mins but it was done in mins my pan was inch longer and inch wider than the x recommended i did glaze it ill have to find a better and x pan to make again also i thought walnuts or pecans would be too strong so i added pistachios they worked great
4,this was good however my blueberries did so k to the bottom i googled my problem and apparantly if u toss the fruit in the flower mixture before adding this will prevent them from sinking it was a little sweet with the icing so next time i will have to try a confectioner sugar glaze
4,this was delicious i assumed the cup of sugar for the glaze was powdered sugar has anyone used granulated sugar for the glaze not sure which is correct
4,this bread turned out really yummy took advise of other reviewers and cut cooking time to minutes also covered the loaf pan with aluminum foil during the last ten minutes to ensure the top didnt brown too much unlike one other reviewer i thought the lemon flavor really came through i did increase the blueberries to cup and cut the sugar to cup
4,wanderful blueberry bread made this today
4,flavor was very good but the blueberries sunk to the bottom not really happy with that
4,very good and flavourful brown the chops first in pan and then remove to make the sauce makes for easy cleanup
4,pretty good i think it needs a little more seasoning like sp but overall it is a very tasty recipe and one i will make again i think buckeys suggestion to brown chops remove and make gravy in the same pan is a good suggestion all the flavor is in the bottom of the pan mine were done in less than an hour
4,made this tonight i used milk instead of broth and added cheese into the sauce and in between the layersyummy
4,this recipe was easy to downsize l used chops i enjoyed the broth instead of milk id make it both ways in the future i served it with oven baked onions nice combo janet vfe
4,reminds me of my mothers recipe except she would use cream of mushroom soup she would sometimes use rice instead of potatoes delicious and heartwarming
4,excellent flavor and very tender
4,i made this for dinner tonight but cut it down to pork chops for the two of us i made it per the recipe except for the addition of poultry seasoning sprinkled on the chops i like this on chops and the potatoes i thought they could probably use more than just salt and pepper i used a mandolin to slice the potatoes and onions very thin the potatoes were delicious but after minutes the inch thick pork chops were dry and way overdone i could not see baking this for the recommended hour and a half since the chops are browned which parcooks them i would recommend checking for doneness early i did have my doubts about scalloped potatoes with chicken broth but they were so good i would make them on their own next time
4,i used bonelessskinless cutletsexcellent dish
4,i substituted applesauce for the oil in a small attempt to make this recipe healthier but i think it made it chewy i also didnt have any buttermilk so i had to find a substitute for that as well its a good recipe and next time ill make it with all the ingredients and no subs
4,we really liked this great flavor and very tasty
4,very good base recipe the gravy was tasty and easy i made it in the crock pot and cooked it for hours on low the gravy was thinner than it would have been but we didnt mind and it kept the pork moist i added a lot more salt and pepper and some rosemary it needed the extra flavor we served it with broccoli
4,i made half recipe for lunch today for and all is gone i forgot the sour cream and used fresh parsley and used the lesser amount of velveeta my nonsoup loving husband liked this soup i can see why it appeals to most people but i like spicier soups i also think the soup is thick enough with the potatoes that the flour slurry is not needed a sharp cheddar in lieu of the velveeta might be an improvement
4,pretty easy and delicious i didnt use the brown sugar colby jack or lemon pepper i used mozzarella because thats what i had and garlic seasoning mix because i dont like lemon pepper i followed others suggestions and did the bacon and onion first i think it would have been better with the colby jack so next time ill make sure i have it and ill crumble the bacon because the strips just slide off
4,excellent recipe but ill make a couple changes next time wish i would have read reviews first about cutting sugar in half my onions were fine but on my husbands plate the onions practically turned into toffeeguess he got most of the drippings and it hardened as it cooled i did like the sweetness thoughalso next time i would pound the breasts flat as well as add more spices like chipotle cumin etc for more zing i did make more onion that called for which was good will certainly make again
4,excellent flavor i had to bake minutes extra
4,yummy lemon and blueberry are a match made in heaven loved this quick and easy to make bread
4,so beautiful delicious and easy to make mine turned out very brown and crisp on the outside by the time the inside was cooked fluffy and moist and i was wondering if anyone had any tips to prevent the outside from becoming more crust like than cake like
4,great recipe just wasnt quite sweet enough for my taste going to soak the blueberries in a little sugar for a few hours next time
4,its delicious but as written this is more like a cheesy potato soup that happens to have a liiiiiittle bit of beef in it too little for me to call it a cheeseburger soup next time ill use a full pound of beef and maybe cut back on the potatoes some
4,i see some reviews by the inevitable health nags well all i can say is look at the number of reviews this recipe has youre outvoted lol made this and it was loved by youngsters and oldsters alike
4,good recipe easy quick i added smoked paprika green peppers garlic thyme used velveeta sharp cheddar and cream cheese i didnt make a roux as i didnt want it to thick added some cornstarch and it was perfect topped w bacon i will definitely make this again
4,prepping takes a bit of time but the meal was good only fixed four pork chops because there are only two of us potatoes were better the second night warmed up with the remaining two chops
4,first time writing a review but wanted to comment after following some of the other reviewer recommendations sadly i should have tried the recipe first as written but so many said that additional sauce was needed so rather than double the ingredients i did a x the amounts and had enough sauce to sufficiently cover the potatoes after an hour i removed the foil and there was so much saucejuice that the dish was swimming in liquid i literally spooned out all of the extra sauce which easily made up the extra that i added the potatoes were very tender used a mandolin for thinner slices and the sauce was a hit delicious next time i would brown the chops and only add to the dish at the last minutes of cooking i used inch chops and they turned out dryer than id like will make again but without the extra sauce
4,i make this recipe all the time although cut back on the amount as it is just myself to cook for now like others i add more broth to make a bit more sauce and put the chops on the bottom to cook until near the end and then transfer them to the top i do add garlic though and a little dijon mustard as i find the dish a bit bland otherwise a great dish though no matter how you cook it
4,so easy and great comfort food doesnt freeze well i cooked it in a slow cooker on low for hrs and worked great
4,this was very good but i forgot to trim the fat off the chops the casserole was a little too greasy im going to try this with boneless skinless chicken breasts has anyone tried this
4,great recipe cooking time to long pork dried outreheated next day made with pre cooked pork sausage balls covered with grated mozzarella good alsopotatoes still great
4,lovely dish next time ill use a little less butter my almostyear old also enjoyed it
4,made this tonight but since of us most nights i made about the receiptthis and green salad and my hubby was very happy and i was too
4,the only difference i made was that i put the chops in the middle of the potatoes
4,i really enjoyed this recipe i did do the chops on the bottom like others have recommended but they were still a tap dry for my tasting ill double up on the sauce next time i also threw in portobello mushrooms which my wife thought was a nice touch i will be having this dish again thanks for the recipe
4,good it is topped not smothered
4,wife and i enjoyed the dish good mix of sweet and savory crispy and tender changes i made to the recipe include frying chicken in bacon grease prior to sauteing onions in bacon grease also used beasleys smokehouse rub poultry powder to season the chicken
4,this is an excellent dish with good flavor i anticipated this as taking a lot of time however with all components being cooked in the same pan once i got the chicken to about i transfered the breasts to a oven safe glass baking dish to finish that allowed me to time getting the chicken to temp and for it to rest while the bacon and then the onionbrown sugar components were completed timing is everything in cooking and this allowed it all to come together nicely
4,quick and tasty i reversed the order and cooked the bacon first using the drippings to cook the chicken one note if your lemonpepper is salt free the dish might need a dash of salt
4,the chicken was very flavorful and tasty i really like the caramelized onions it seemed like they really added a lot to the chicken being we always get the precooked bacon from schwans i couldnt add bacon grease instead i just added a little more oil i also put the dish in the microwave to melt the cheese
4,loved it made my own lemon pepper with fresh lemon peels pepper and salt next time i make this i am going to cut bacon into small pieces and saut it with the onions and then carmelize it my chicken breast where kind of thick think it would work better with thinner breast
4,good the onions were delicious and a big hit slice the chicken breasts in half horizontally if thick or they take forever to cook
4,quick dinner and the bacon and onions really flavor the chicken next time i will use a different seasoningspice as i dont like lemon pepper seasoning and thought it took away from the flavor rather than enhancing it
4,this was a hit in our house i followed the recipe exactly but next time i would double the amount of meat and half the amount of potatoes but even as is everyone enjoyed it and the leftovers got eaten the next day for lunch
4,i totally forgot the sour cream but did add tsp worchestershire sauce that really enhanced the flavor i also added some shredded cheese as the velveeta is a little bland for this wisconsinite i did use fewer potatoes as one reviewer noted and a little less broth as we line thicker soups
4,first apple pie i have ever made and it turned out great
4,this is quite tasty but i found the crust a little too dense for my liking however it is still quite good and i agree that it is easy and quick much less intimidating than a standard crust my husband liked it a lot
4,this is a large and tasty pie i added a little cinnamon and will try other fruits and berries when i make it again
4,amazing easy apple pie recipe i was looking for a quick and easy recipe to try and found it the pie has all the flavors of a traditional apple pie but takes the time i added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the syrup to add some more fall essence overall an award winning recipe
4,as a real born and raised dutchie i never put any extra sugar in this pie i dont like it so sweet it needs to be a little sweet and a little sour of applles or lemonjuice instead its ment to be a fresh treat thats the reason why i only use sugar in the dough together with the apples i mix in some cinnamon and lemonjuice spoon its toooo yammie with whipped cream enjoy
4,just need alittle apple pie spice and its great
4,my family loved this apple pie this is a simple recipe i substitued brown sugar splenda in the crust but not in the filling i also added about tsp of apple pie spice to the filling to give it a little more flavor it turned out perfectly
4,a family favorite around here we substitute real cheese for velveeta and that just increases the flavor
4,what a fabulous meal i used a smidge of smart balanceamish butter instead of canola over chicken thighs i didnt have lemon pepper so squeezed fresh lemon after rolling it to release the juices on both sides after browning then crisped the thick cut bacon this is actually easier if you use scissors and cut the bacon in pc cooks quicker alsoin a separate cast iron pan i carmelized small onions in butter and spooned some of the bacon greases into it as needed fresh sharp white cheddar worked for me as welli chopped romainebuttercrunch lettuces and rough cut a few craizines cranberry raisins wcoarse pepper alternating the various delectable pieces with lettuce was almost like wilted lettuce but betterbrava i am seriously impressed
4,made this in a bundt pan and other then not baking for as long as in a bread pan it came out very good easy and yummy
4,this was a great recipe however the meat was not as tender not sure what i did wrong
4,to keep chops from drying out and staying tender i put the chops on the bottom and the potatoes on top turns out tender and moist
4,the potatoes are excellent the pork chops were dry but i think its because they were too thin they say chops for a reason
4,reminded us of a chicken version of traditional beef stew we peeled and cubed one large baking potato and added with the celery and carrots we also added two bay leaves the dumplings were a gummy mess but i normally do not have issues with dumplings and think this was just poor execution on my part the broth did thicken and look creamy from some of the dumpling residue will make this again great for a cold minnesota dinner
4,loved the flavor of the chicken soup i did end up thickening it up with instant potatoes did not like the dumplings though ended up fishing them out and dumping them
4,this was very good and my kids loved it the only thing i changed was i used italian seasoning instead of poultry seasoning because i dont like sage
4,this was so yummy my husband loves chicken and dumplings but i could never find a recipe turned out for me i did add a little garlic and onion powder and did not use low sodium chicken broth just for flavor i also used a rotisserie chicken because my husband likes dark meat better the dumplings were so good even the next day for leftovers thank you for sharing this recipe its a keeper
4,very good the only change i made was to cook the dumplings uncovered over low heat minutes then cover and cook minutes longer as instructions on my biscuit mix instructed this makes sure the dumplings are done and tender it also thickens the sauce a bit
4,i would definitey substitute the fat free milk with whole milkto get that rich creamy full bodied gravy
4,this is wonderful quick and delicious after making it a few times as the recipe says ive started adding a tsp of poultry seasoning to the biscuit mix really good
4,great and easy must add spices or its bland
4,definitely would add cinnamon nutmeg and pumpkin pie spice to jazz it up tastes a lot like a apple pie crumble
4,i made this for the first time yesterday for after dinner and not a single crumb was leftthank you it was great
4,if you make this pie listen the advice of the kind reviewers and add some spices i added cinnamon and nutmeg to the filling and the crumbs and sprinkled more cinnamon on top to make it pretty i would call it apple crisp pie i used a inch pie plate and it was quite full my bottom crust became hard which made it hard to eat with a fork im starting to think my oven runs a little hot so ill need to decrease the cooking time or turn it down degrees
4,i made this tonight i did change it up a little bit though i omitted the carrots and the roux used to thicken the soup when a soup has lots of cheese like this one does a roux to thicken things isnt really necessary in my opinion i added a little bit of dill weed as well which gave it a little kick my boyfriend had picked out a hickory smoked bourbon gouda that he decided he wasnt a fan of after i already sliced some for his lunch so i threw that in there too were definitely going to be making it again
4,it would have gotten stars if there were more spices in the filling though i follow this recipe then add cinnamon clove allspice amp ginger to tasteits a hit
4,my husband doesnt care for apple pie but he really liked this i will make this again i also put cinnamon in it because we like cinnamon in apple desserts
4,tasty i reduced the brown sugar to cup and i also added tsp ground cinnamon when i stirred in the apples and vanilla into the cornstarch mixture
4,my husband and i enjoyed this dessert i added cinnamon since we both like it with apple desserts will make it again
4,made as directed it was good but not exceptional i thought with all the star reviews it would be better hubby loved it
4,i really liked this pie my first attempt was less than great but some was my own fault i forgot the vanilla but the amount of apples also seemed far too many for the size of the pie pan i had apples and sauce overflowing even so it tasted ok and was easy to do so i tried it again my second effort i limited it to cups of apples mixed granny smith and golden delicious i made certain to include the vanilla and also added a bit of cinnamon to the apples in addition bc i have a real sweet tooth i added an additional c brown sugar to the topping portion this adjustment turned out great i made one for myself and took one to a church dinner thanks i plan to make another for christmas dinner
4,i love a crumb topping like this on apple pie and was excited to make it went together fine and liked not having to get out the rolling pin i cooked the sugar corn starch and water for the filling in the microwaveso easy that way them added the apples i also added t cinnamon and t nutmeg because of personal preferences flavor was excellent my complaint is that the topping got very soggy quickly maybe it was kind of apples i used or fact that i stored pie in a tupperware pie container with a tight fitting lid anyway i am going to make another pie shortly to take to a gathering tonight
4,i would have given this stars however it definitely lacks cinnamon and nutmeg i should have read the reviews before i made it i think with those additions this would be a star pie love the crust i love that it adds more texture and flavor vs a standard crust i might even add some finely chopped walnuts or pecans to the streusel topping
4,this pie was easy to prepare the no roll crust and topping is delicious as i was making this pie i noticed it did not call for any cinnamon after reading several other reviews i decided to add some cinnamon and nutmeg to the filling i would also reserve more like cups of the crust mixture for the topping
4,this was so easy love the preparation technique for the crust and topping i thought it needed some spice so next time i made it i added in teaspoon cinnamon to the flour mixture i also added cup chopped nuts typically peans or walnuts and i thought this provided some nice crunch i will definitely make this pie again
4,i gave this four stars because it needed tweaking i wouldnt even consider making a dessert with apples without cinnamon so yes i did the same i added a tsp of cinnamon and a tsp of nutmeg i also had some trouble with the cornstarch clumping up in the water no matter how long i boiled the water so i wound up with a few gummy clumps in my pie so next time i make this i would have to add the cornstarch slowly also i baked mine for mins and it was too long my crust was hard and it was darker brown not like the picturebut then again i should have known because that is how my oven isso yes i would definitely make this again and just bake it for less time and would also solve my cornstarch problem the flavor was great with the added spices
4,my husband loved it i think it could use an extra half pound of beef the only thing i changed was adding paprika to the finished product a bread bowl wouldve been nice to as it is very cheesey get the good cheese
4,i would give this five stars if some seasoning had also been added to the dumpling dough while the poultry seasoning in the soup is good it doesnt make up for the lack of seasoning in the dumpling i will continue to use this recipe but will do the dumplings a little differently next time
4,tastes good family liked it but the dumplings at the cracker barrels in texas louisiana mississippi arkansas tennessee virginia georgia alabama oklahoma are flat and not gummy at all
4,no actually dumplings do not always have egg in them actually traditional dumplings are baking powder flower salt some type of shortening and a milk product it is the way the shortening is mixed in that makes them so moist and fluffy and being steamed on top this is a good recipe i made my greatgrandmothers traditional dumplings on top though approved by my boyfriends brother who is a master chef he says dumplings are not traditionally made with egg
4,it was very good i cut recipe in half as there is only two of us i wasnt sure what to expect so i was a little surprised to find it as soupy as it was just thought it would have been a little thicker but still very good
4,i used frozen mixed veggies it was good i think the sauce should be thickened the dumplings should be flipped when firm so the other side cooks
4,easy and tastey perfect comfort food for a chilly night i like to add additional veggies whatever i have sometimes even frozen mixed veggies
4,good
4,my family loved this i will make this again
4,very good and so easy it did need some salt i thought i added about teaspoon or so i made a few alternations as well instead of canned chicken broth my mom makes and freezes it i put in about cups of broth i also added one less cup of chicken instead of using cups biscuit mix i used cups using my moms homemade biscuit recipe this is what i used cups flour t baking powder t salt t lard mix all ingredients together then add your milk you may need to add about a tablespoon or so more mix so easy and quick it tastes a lot like stuffing
4,very easy to makehardest part was chopping the veggies very tasty my husband loved it too
4,i really like this recipie for its versatility and simplicity i had never made this dish before and it was a great starting point
4,this was so easy and pretty tasty especially for a healthier recipe the family really liked it so ill be making it again next time i might add some onions and skip the poultry seasoning
4,this recipe was super easy to make and really tasty i did make some modificationsi added on medium diced onion a sprinkling of garlic salt and one heaping tsp of cornstarch mix into c water
4,this recipe turned out to be very very good makes an awesome dinner on cold evenings will definitely be making this againsoon
4,the banana bread was good three of us finished the two loaves in days i will try the recipe on this site that uses pineapple and compare
4,this is a very good banana bread i did not change anything except did not use any frosting or sauce loved it
4,great flavorcakelike texturenot moist and dense
4,works fine with whole wheat flour if youre crazy about pecans use the cups or you could get by fine with and not sprinkle them on top theresa
4,could someone answer if the cheesecake remains in the springform pan overnight while cooling ive experienced that my fall if taken out too soon it is asking me to rate but i havent tried it yet
4,love this recipe really easy just needs a little extra flavor for my taste added an onion to the veggies and some garlic also added some salt and rosemary and parsley quick and really good might try another reviewers idea and use a rotisserie chicken next time
4,yes i would make this again but i would for sure use the sodium reduced everything i didnt use sodium reduced broth and it turned out a little salty but will keep this on my remake list i made my own dumplings from scratch and every one liked them i also put in peas garliconion a bay leaf and i substituted of the cans of broth to cream of chicken soup i will definately make this again
4,i used cans of cream of chicken soup plus a large can of broth i also cut up a couple of small red potatoes sometimes i used diced hash browns plus chopped onions my final addition is once i add the dumplings i gently stir in a handful of frozen peas my family requests this recipe often during the winter months
4,the dumplings took a little longer than the recipe said they were very pasty looking but tasted very good i subbed corn for carrots i didnt have any carrots and it turned out really good even my picky six year old really like this i would make it again for sure
4,this was really easy and good my kids and husband loved it i did not use reduced chicken broth or fat free milk and biscuitbaking mix it turned out fine i will be making again
4,it was really good the only thing i would change is probably add onions and a little salt with it but i will definitely make it again
4,really good everyone loved it i also put fresh garlic in it
4,made this for my family they loved it had enough left over the next night to serve over biscuits would be great served over cooked noodles too
4,i made these cookies for the first time today the flavor is excellent my cookies came out very flat though i think i will try them again and add just a little more flour
4,i have made a similar cookie for years but lost my old recipe these were actually softer than my recipe which i like i did reduce the sugar to cup i reduce the sugar in almost all recipes increased the flour to cups and they came out perfect in texture and sweetness next time i would add a bit more spice but otherwise very good
4,one of our favourite cookie recipes this time of year ive been making them for years and they always go over well
4,really tasty i did season the ground beef while cooking and skipped the mushrooms and i drained the meat used regular velvetta and mexican velvetta because i had it in the fridge will definately make it again
4,for loisk you can make it or not eat it or not thats your own business and we dont get to know but being rude is something we all get to see soup is good
4,to jasmin just do it like she says and instead of dutch oven use crock pot add milk flour and cheese about mins to an hour before done
4,delicious
4,family really enjoyed this substituted a oz bag of hashbrowns for potatoes and sauteed onions green pepper and carrots with the meat left out the mushrooms since i forgot to buy them also substituted a small can of chopped green chilies for the jalapeño we will make again
4,the broth was excellent but it seemed more like a cheesy potato soup than cheeseburger well enjoy this soup anyway and ill make this again but next time ill double the meat and cut back on the potatoes to make it more cheeseburgery
4,i made these soft ginger cookies and thought they were really good and soft but have decided i like the crispy oldfashioned version better so will be making those instead if you like soft cookies try this recipe
4,this is a good base recipe but the flavor is a bit flat if you bake much the lack of vanilla extract and the small amount of salt would jump out at you right off the bat also for those having trouble getting them to be thick an chewy remember that its virtually impossible to over mix dough until youve added the flour get it good and fluffy make sure to scrape the sides of the bowl several times if youre using a stand mixer i made the following changesadditions and the richness of the flavor was extremely popular with friends tsp salt tsp cinnamon tsp vanilla extract tsp lebkuchengewurz german gingerbread spice i use a disher for consistency my old convection oven would finish them in minutes my recent one takes minutes
4,gave stars because as other reviewers said the batter was thin so that it was hard to roll the dough i added c more flour and chilled the dough balls for minutes before baking still they were very flat after baking the flavor was excellent however loved the spicy taste of the ginger spice blend when cool they were slightly crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside will make again and try adding more flour to see if i can get them to be a slightly thicker cookie
4,i think this recipe is a great starting point for ginger cookies the ginger flavor isnt super noticeable though if you like me crave the warmth of a strong ginger taste ive made a couple modifications to make these cookies healthier and tastier while not compromising the softness of the cookies replaced half of the flour with ragi flour ragi is a finger millet and has high protein mineral and fiber content reduced butter to tbsp with the additions below there is extra moisture in the batter and no need to use as much butter you could in fact reduce butter further to or tbsp since i found my batter a little sticky and hard to form into balls increased ginger to tsp added half a cup of shredded coconut added half a cup of flax seed powder i havent had a problem with the cookies spreading out too thin in fact ive had the opposite issue of them not spreading out enough it may have to do with where i am located even in the summer its quite chilly i leave my egg and butter out to let them warm up to room temperature and use a stand mixer so they get nice and fluffy i also use molasses which is super sticky so that may contribute to reducing the spread
4,these are good recipe produced a really stiff dough for me anyway wish id started stirring the dry ingredients earlier stand mixer was not happy and im with those who suggested to flatten at least a bit mine didnt flatten as they cooled my mom had a recipe who knows where it came from called super ginger snaps a softtype drop cookie but more strongly spiced still my favorites
4,i wouldnt give it stars as is but they are pretty good the key to getting these to stay soft is to not over bake them which is very easy to do min max you almost have to take them out before they look totally done also for those who had issues with spreading its likely also because of the use of only butter in the recipe butter makes cookies flatter i used half butter half butter butter flavored crisco and that did seem to help i think next time though i would use all crisco though i also nearly doubled the spices i tasted the dough first and it just didnt have that ginger taste i was going for so i adjusted instead of rolling in sugar i used a hard cookie glaze and dribbled it over them came out pretty great
4,added a little more molasses and added some nutmeg perfect
4,very very good but not the best ive ever made
4,made these for a halloween party added teaspoons of all spice and teaspoons of nutmeg because i thought it could use more flavor when i tasted the batter also did as another poster suggested and used oz of cream cheese and that was perfect for the icing icing was thin so next time i make it i will leave out the milk completely very good baserecipe though
4,the only difference in your and my recipe is i like to ad a tsp on cloves and tsp nutmeg for a real holiday flavor and i throw in a cup of raisins too
4,taste great but turned out to be a cake the only thing i can think thata i did wrong was used too small of a pan
4,i love how easy and delicious the frosting is to make no store bought
4,i doubled all the veggies used half and half instead of milk and added one cup of sharp cheddar mmmm mmmm good
4,i had to use cheesewhiz and it seems to work well my family enjoyed it
4,having company for a week any chance this one freezes well
4,i added a little relishmade it even more like a cheeseburger
4,i found this to be a bit on the heavy side for a soup it had more of a stew look but it was very tasty and made for a filling soup
4,great meal on a cool fall day
4,the cookies were delicious soft and full of flavor both my husband and i loved them the only reason i didnt give the recipe five stars is because it says this recipe should make dozen but i made it too the letter balls for the dough and it only made cookies i would double the recipe
4,my husband and i both love this recipe but i leave out the sugar and use stevia instead one pack for us and i disagree with the comment about it not being good for leftovers we think its even better the day after
4,loved this but a little too sweet added apple cider vinegar and it came out great
4,i omitted the mustard and used apple cider vinegar for tartness i also used regular salt and added a little black pepper and diced green onion this is pretty darn good dressing the sour cream makes it really creamy and keeps it from being too sweet i will absolutely make it again thanks for sharing it
4,odd pic shows carrots but not mentioned in recipe ingredients
4,very good i did not use the coleslaw mix because i had fresh cabbage from the garden i really enjoyed the dressing but next time i will add some fresh lemon juice i will definitely make this recipe again
4,delicious i love the flavor the seasoned salt dry mustard and celery salt give it ive used normal coleslaw mix and broccoli slaw ive also halved the sugar its all been good the only reason i give stars is because it needs a splash of vinegar i use apple cider vinegar it also is too much dressing i either double the slaw mix or halve the dressing that being said this is the only coleslaw recipe i make no need for any other
4,this is my goto coleslaw recipe i give it stars instead of because i always add some cider vinegar to perfect the dressing
4,i make a similar coleslaw but i like to add fruit i add pineapple tidbits cut mandarine oranges and dried cranberries have even added diced granny smith apples i like things sweet rather than savory and this fruit addition adds the sweet i crave
4,good recipe but use half or no sugar the first time i made it with the sugar the second time with half the sugar still a good recipe with less sugar
4,the first time i made this for my mom and she loved it my brother had some and loved it too i just made some for myself and i added half a pack of banana cream pudding mix to make it even more moist and smooth i love my revised version
4,this was a really good slaw but like some other reviewers noted it did need a bit of vinegar i added tablespoon of cider vinegar and the flavor elevated at first i thought it was a lot of mayo and sour cream for only one package of slaw mix but it was the right amount before you combine the dressing and slaw taste to adjust flavor to your tastes i also added black pepper just because i like pepper as a volunteer field editor i recommend this recipe
4,i have a recipe thats very similar to this one and i always use applesauce in place of oil in all my recipes also i use a cookie sheet instead of a cake pan and oven for almost hour its always awesome
4,these are really good i added a shake of cloves in it too
4,these are simple to make and tasty a family favorite
4,i used pumpkin pie spice instead of just cinnamon ill put in teaspoons next time overall easy and tasty
4,i used gluten free all purpose flour to make it gluten free for my son also used milk velveeta it was delicious very thick and filling
4,the soup went over well with the family the only changes i would make would be to use the full pound of hamburger and change the ratio of butter to flour to make the roux the recipes directions made a thick dry paste i could actually taste the flour in the soup so when i make this again i will use tbsp of butter to cup flour i may need to tweek it a little so the roux is pourable instead of a lumpy paste
4,i agree with christine picnic and folks will rip the bowl out of your hands
4,to make this a one disher versus two dishes i made the dressing first in a rubbermaid type container then added the cabbage mixture i can flip it every so often in the fridge til dinner time instead of stirring itive made it several times since then and weve enjoyed it we enjoy a hint of vinegar lime juice or other acidic to cut down on the overall sweetness so i did add that in the additional makings i also cut down on the sugar ever so slightly personal preference not the recipes faultto make the slaw the star we make tortillas on these hot summer nights using this slaw a tortilla wrap and leftover grilled pork though shrimp fish or chicken are all okay toothanks for sharing this recipe sorry i did make the modifications so it isnt really the original but i hate doing dishes so i try to conserve whenever possible
4,i felt it was somewhat bland i added celery seed and a splash of apple cider vinegar and that made it much better its a keeper
4,have made this for yearsbut cut the mayo to cup and add or tb of vinegar cut sugar to tb
4,i personally felt it was too rich and that it needed more of an acid so with a little bit of apple cider vinegar it turned out great
4,loved the creaminess next time ill add a little kick maybe horseradish
4,sometimes coleslaw is too sweet and sometimes its too tart this is a good balance i used celery seeds instead of the celery salt because i like them a keeper
4,im not really a fan of banana bread but i had all the ingredients so i tried this one its amazing does anyone know if it freezes well id like to keep a few loaves on hand
4,my tongue is still tingling from my first piece fresh out of the oven hot and yummypros moist and baked through i was really worried about putting it all in one pan because i hate partially cooked banana bread this was banana bread not pudding and i liked very much great flavor however i did cut back on the sugar only cup brown and cup white and substituted applesauce for oil didnt have buttermilk onhand so i just used milk and put some butter in for flavor my dd and i are more than happy with the resultraised up to a beautiful loaf of bread i dont know if it helped that i whisked the banana and egg mixture with an electric beater to be sure i didnt have banana globs i will continue to do thatcons considering how sweet it is i would not follow the recipe sugar recommendationbake time for my loaf was too long and i only had it in for minutes i was glad it was baked through but if this had been for gifts i would not have shared the ends will be way too tough and overdone it is very tough about a half to an inch around if i would have gone the full hr minutes it would have been like a gummy bearoverall love it going back for my second slice now
4,made it for the first time tonight and really liked it the only thing i will do different the next time is double the sauce and thickener cover the pan for about the first minutes add the cornstarch mix and then leave the pan uncovered for the final minutes that might leave enough sauce to put on rice
4,so so so so good i used rice vinegar instead of white vinegar and used frozen concentrated orange juice i also made my own chinese spice powder with equal parts of ground cloves ground fennel ground anise cinnamon and black pepper
4,great flavor but double the sauce i actually made it in a crockpot delicious
4,v ery good flavor i used boneless chicken breasts and cooked them in the crockpot for hours a definite keeper thanks for the recipe
4,these bars are what pumpkin bars should be delicious and moist i chilled them several hours before serving them i plan on making them again for the upcoming holidays
4,if i was just reviewing the bars without the frosting i would give this stars they are so good i baked mine in a x pan per the recipe and had to make extra frosting as there was not enough to cover the top even with a very thing layer oz of cream cheese is a strange amount i used the whole oz brick and added the proportion of powdered sugar and milk needed to finish topping the bars i wonder if theres a typo in the recipe should it be oz of cream cheese or should it have been oz would have been plenty of frosting maybe too much for a x using oz but not enough for the x
4,i added pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon i had a hard time getting it done all the way i thin next time i will only add half of the oil a cup seems like way too much
4,im going with for stars only because these turn out more of a pan bread or cake not bars amazing flavor in the cake and icing
4,made in a cake pan i cut cup sugar and split the cup sugar brown and granulated i also substituted half of the oil with applesauce and added teaspoon of ginger tsp of clove and of nutmeg i made the icing exactly to the recipe solid stars as a cake but i think it would be as a bar i will make again
4,i read williams review which suggested his was better what is wrong with him to be so childish and mean spirited made the soup for my husband last night and he loved it not exactly the healthiest soup but definitely a crowd pleaser for kids and grown men
4,very tasty chicken will definitely make again and maybe next time i will remember to put the green onions on top didnt miss them but will definitely try to remember to add them next time very easy to put together
4,this recipe was very good we are trying to eat lowcarb therefore i didnt make the rice i did double the sauce which wasnt really necessary without the rice but we enjoyed it i also omitted the chinese fivespice powder as i didnt have any on hand
4,this was good and we enjoyed the flavor but i would use boneless skinless chicken thighs next time and perhaps double the sauce ingredients as there wasnt much sauce
4,i skipped the skillet part and just baked the whole thing in the oven really good we all liked it
4,dh loved this it was flavorful without being overly spicy i also omitted the thickening step and did not miss it
4,this was good but i made it with pound of cubed boneless pork a sliced yellow onion a sliced green bell pepper and a sliced yellow bell pepper i tripled the sauce ingredients except for the brown sugar which i doubled i let it simmer for minutes instead of because of the meat cube size we had enough sauce for our rice too
4,thumbs up in my house
4,very delicious and rich and creamy did a few changes just because worked with what i had but still a very awesome succulent soup stars
4,i thought this was good and will make it again but i thought the flavor needed something moremaybe ill add the asian chili sauce like was suggested
4,very time consuming to make a lot of steps and ingredients the taste is that of a snickers bar so for me it is not worth the effort i followed the recipe exactly and made sure that each layer had set up in the refrigerator before adding the next and let sit over night before cutting the fudge cut into perfect one inch squares
4,these are delicious but they are time consuming as many other reviewers have stated also i had big problems with them falling apart too id like to know how they got that pic posted because even in the fridge the chocolate slid off the top of the caramel
4,remind me of a snickers bars time consuming to make but easy
4,i was just wondering if these can be frozen
4,five stars for taste stars for time consuming everyone loves the taste have to keep them refrigerated or the filling sags wonder how it would be with dulce de leche in place of the caramel layer
4,this candy received such great reviews that i tried it i froze the layers and gave them time to set then refrigerated the whole thing it seemed to turn out great so i put them in treat boxes for the holidays after a little while i started noticing the melting that someone else mentioned the candy started to slide as the caramel softened i think these either need to be served chilled or need to be dipped in a chocolate paraffin to keep them together
4,my layers are seperating when i try to cut into square i let it sit for min before cutting then let it sit a little longer but then the marshmallow layer starts to squash out any suggestions
4,this recipe was great but i got so frustrated when the chocolate kept cracking while i was cutting it does anyone have a solution to this problem thanks
4,its a bit difficult to cut as it has to be just right at room temperature to cut but the taste is awesome ill definitely add this to my candy recipe box
4,the taste was amazing but even with wiping the knife off each time the chocolate cracked top layer and the caramel cant be out of the fridge for more than miuntes without melting kinda frustrating as i made them to pass out and they werent cheap to make but very tasty
4,this recipe was fairly easy to make however the icing didnt work well for me while cooking it became very thick and wouldnt spread so i added a tablespoon of butter to thin it out it spread very well i let it set in the refridgerator and did as the instructions said and let it set out for minutes before cutting the icing fell into a million pieces so im not sure what else i could do but it is very delicious as is with or without icing and i would make it again
4,tastes like a grilled cheeseburger different amp easy good over egg noodles the potatoes seemed strange at first but then they blended in amp reminded me of burger amp fries i tweaked it tripled the beef amp added better than boullion beef flavor a cup each of veggies bumped up the spices campbells beef consomm amp french onion soup plus two cans of water left the potato amount the same amp added more cheese left out the sour cream since it tasted good as is all you need is crusty bread amp a pickle
4,these taste great but fall apart
4,this was the best recipe ever for pancakes i tried one morning and the kids loved them i just need to double the recipe this time because it was not enough last time
4,very light and fluffy i also used tbs of oil and they came out perfect
4,good but super thick batter
4,i also had to add a tad more milk but they were great and i will make again
4,this was really good i was skeptical with the orange juice because i have had bad experiences in the past but it was delicious also the crushed red pepper was perfect my husband is pretty sensitive to spice and he didnt even notice i used breasts instead of thighs just because thats what i had on hand excellent and easy
4,recipes looks delicious amp appreciate the helpful recommendations from other cooks although this has to be the most unattractive photograph of a dish ive seen in a long time looks bad tastes good
4,i made this last night it was ok but it sure didnt look like the picture my sauce wasnt red in color at all it was more of a yellowish color it might have been because i didnt have the chinese five spice so maybe that is what gives it the color it wasnt bad tasting but i thought it needed something else we did have it over rice
4,very good i halved the red pepper but it still had quite a bite so go easy on the red pepper if youre not a heat lover i did double the sauce and will definitely do that again next time
4,very good easy recipe i used chicken breasts and did not add the five spice powder and it was still very good i plan on making these again i loved the sweet flavor
4,this was a great simple recipe but like others i did have to improvise a bit the batter was super thick so i added about a halfcup additional milk and i added an extra tablespoon sugar since i am american and finally a but if vanilla just improved it enough to make it wonderful
4,fairly simple enough to follow recipe but like others i made a couple of changes added more milk to make the batter a bit thinner and a bit more sugar to compensate for the added milk i did so after trying to make a pancake with the original recipe and ended up with a pancake that was way overcooked on the outside and still raw on the inside the thinner batter and lower than i would normally set temperature made for a fully cooked golden pancake im just waiting for my daughters opinion on the flavor now
4,i just made these for my brunch and theyre really good i added cinnamon to them but i will add chocolate chips to make them even more tasty
4,the only thing bad i could say which isnt even bad at all is to put like a teaspoon of vanilla i always put vanilla in my pancakes so i was like ok ill just add it in but to me pancakes are sooo much better with vanilla but its a perfect batter and really easy to make into a perfect shape will use this recipe every time
4,just made these for breakfast used whole wheat flour and added about tsp almond extractturned out very yummy will definitely make again
4,
4,these turned out tasty i used butter instead of shortening and changed to gluten free allpurpose flour i also added vanilla extract and used additional milk i am looking forward to trying different variations on these like adding fruit
4,four stars only because it didnt seem to turn out quite like the others said probably my fault howeveri will definitely make it again because the husband really enjoyed it and i think i know what i did wrong hopefully alsodidnt change anything
4,i love this recipe my icing did not breakcrumble what i did was i let the final icing layer set at room temp for several hours prior to putting it in the fridge i let it set overnight and then when i took it out i let it get to room temp approx hour then cut with a paring knife the caramel did not run either
4,i made this recipe a few days ago for the first time after reading all the rave reviews and found it to be awesomely good however like some of the other reviews i too had a problem with the top icing layer cracking and breaking to pieces when i cut it and it didnt stick to the caramel layer under it i was dissapointed by that happening and wondered if anyone has a solution to keeping the top icing layer from breaking into many pieces and not sticking to the caramel layer i followed the directions completely and also followed what the reviewer spoir wrote on december to keep the top icing layer from splitingcracking and it still didnt work i also had a problem of cutting it into nice square pieces since the caramel layer was hard to cut through and it came out in jagged edges it didnt look like the evenly cut pieces in the picture at all and i found it took me a long time to made it well after all this i still will keep trying to make this turn out right since it was so delicious and adictive
4,i love this recipe but every time i make these when i cut them the top layer cracks so they dont look so pretty the caramel mixture also spills over the sides not pretty but very good maybe i should try freezing them so the caramel stays put
4,this soup is quite good but time consuming for preparation i followed the recipe to a twith the exception of slicing the carrots i gave it a star rating as the amount of flourbutter did not thicken the soup cup flour t butter would probably be much better unfortunately the soup was watery
4,this is a good soup i tweaked it as i didnt have the mushroom soup and skipped the flour butter soup directions and made a package of williams sausage gravy really as directed and finished the soup if you dont want to use up another pan for cooked rice add it raw with the first ingredients and simmer for minutes sometimes i add slices of real american cheese to make it even more creamy
4,good soup
4,i made it exactly as directed the seasonings gave it good flavor though i didnt really care as much for the strong chicken broth flavor that the cups of it gave the soup i imagined a creamier broth based on the picture and the can of cream of mushroom soup it contained but it really wasnt that creamyjust very chicken brothy still good
4,looks like a very healthy dish for what ails you
4,everyone really liked the soup but it had a little too much juice next time i will add less chicken broth
4,for those who like a very sweet banana bread this is excellent the only difference between this recipe and the one ive been making for years is my recipe calls for cup sugar amp still excellentjust less sweet
4,the flavor is excellent but like others i must say that i coud not get the center done which is the reason for stars instead of i agree with the person who suggested baking it in two smaller loaves the crusty top is a real plus
4,for my familys taste i will use more hamburger and less potatoes we all liked it though i followed the recipe exactly but might try some cheddar next time
4,we really liked this one i baked it instead of grilling and it turned out really good
4,would make a good grilled chicken sandwich use breast vs thighs with grilled pineapple ring and extra sauce
4,my family favors chicken breast sliced thinthe flavor is very good
4,good basic recipe for pancakes i added apple pie spice and nutmeg as well as vanilla batter was thin enough with only cup of milk would also be good with bananas
4,i marinated sliced mushrooms with this the last hour only grilled with sliced pineapple and served with ricearoni not sure why it says prep time is minutes when it needs to marinate hours i have had a version of this recipe for many years and instead of ketchup it asks for cup dry sauterne and t dijon mustard no brown sugar and half the soy sauce it is not as salty and calorie count is lower but equally good
4,absolutely the best the fluffiest i added only tsp of the baking powder and it turned out perfect i would add another tablespoon of sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla the next time
4,excellent next time i am going to add a bit more seasoning to give it more flavor
4,hearty supper
4,next time would add yoghurt in place of applesauce normally used and gives moisture but also great taste prefer recipes that outline exactly what the glutenfree flour combo is
4,so far the best i have made except it was a bit heavy and i had to cook it for min and it still felt like i needed to cook it more but i took it out any suggestions to make it lighter i substituted stevia for sugar and added xanthan gum to flourdbertan
4,i made it for my husband who is hawaiian he said it was delicious then he gave me his family recipe for huli huli chicken this recipe will be made again
4,this was better than expected and i was expecting something good the only thing i did different was used sherry and chicken broth might use all sherry next time when i make this again i think i will also use a little less soy sauce i found it more salty than sweet
4,we liked the marinade i just added pineapple to it because we love pineapple chicken i added chicken breast along with the thighs
4,the grown ups loved the flavor of this marinade i cubed the chicken and made kabobs the kids complained a lot with this one yikes it was good enough to make again for adults
4,this was not as sweet as i was hoping for the taste of the soy sauce was a little overpowering and i did use the lite soy sauce might try again and alter it slightly
4,i made this recipe using both chicken thighs and breasts and i like the taste of the chicken breasts the best they seemed to absorb more of the marinade and the flavor was very bright i thought the flavor was a little subdued in the thigh meat
4,very good chicken recipe moist and good flavor
4,we enjoyed this recipe l will make it again we liked the sweetness the chicken had
4,clipnmom oz cheese cups when grated i use cheddar cheese or pepper jack because i dont like processed cheese i add a dash of worchestershire sauce too crumbled bacon and chopped tomato on top yummy
4,very nice recipe strong earthy mushroom and rice flavors which i really enjoy
4,really good although i did season it some more makes a huge lot so i hope this freezes well
4,unfortunately i have to rate it before i can ask a question sounds delicious and i want to make it but what brandkind of cocoa powder is everyone using from reading up on cocoa powders dutch seems to be the bestmost flavorable bug of course the most expensive appreciate any feedback
4,this was a rich dense cake that tasted good the frosting recipe as written comes out thin and runny it tasted good but was not like the picture if i make this again i will try whipping the cream first as others have suggested
4,help i have made this twice following the recipe exactly and it falls in the middle each time the cake is delicious but i cant serve it with the sunken middle any suggestions how to solve this problem thanks
4,the cake is great i wish that the recipe would mention that the whipping cream should be whipped st pounds of powered sugar just doesnt make a nice frosting oh it spreads ok but you cant taste the cream cheese when it has a star rating i didnt think i needed to read the reviews for tips
4,made this cake for st patricks day the cake is absolutely wonderful the recipe calls for cups of powdered sugar not pounds as stated in a previous review this is one of my go to cake recipes will make it againand againand again
4,when i visited ireland i happened upon a slice of dark chocolate guinness cake soo goood been looking for the recipe ever since i got back to the states this one is great first time i made it though was a flop nothing but a sinkhole but still actually tasted great saw lots of other people having the same issue cut back on the baking soda nd time i only used tsp and it rose perfectly and dont use the wisk when adding in flour and baking soda use a spoon and stir just until everything is all weti also like to give a bit of spice to my cream cheese frosting add in some good cinnamon and ground ginger to give it a bit of extra kick wont be that perfect frosty white though
4,very moist and tastes ok not sure i will make it again though there is a strong flavor to the cake that i do not really like also i had to add vanilla to the frosting otherwise i didnt change anything perhaps it will taste better tomorrowsome things are like that one thing i really liked about the recipe is that it is quick to make and i did not have to get out my big mixer
4,i made this for a st patricks day dessert it was easy to make and tasted pretty good i think the guinness beer took away some of the chocolate flavor though i used dark cocoa powder and still thought it lacked chocolate flavor i would definitely add more cocoa powder and maybe some extra sugar to sweeten it up a bit the texture was very moist though and my kids loved it
4,i love this cake and so does everyone else ive made it twice and each time it sinks in the middle no one has given me a reason would someone please tell me why it sinks and how to fix it
4,no way this recipe can continue in a small saucepan i had to transfer contents to a laree casserole dish prior to adding the flour
4,i was surprised to not have to use xanthan gum powder for this recipe but i was also intrigued because it was described to taste like the real thing i included chocolate chips and guessed at the reduced time for muffins when they achieved the expected brown colour anyway they turned out slightly dry so i will try removing them sooner next time
4,i could tell the batter was very soupy for a bread recipe i stirred in another cup of gf all purpose flour stirred in the nuts and because i was shy one banana i added a small peeled and shredded zucchini that gave more consistency to the batter i use almond milk in place of cows milk too came out wonderful moist sliced well now we will see how she freezes
4,i hate ranking this recipe because i did not make this strictly according to the directions because i wanted to make it a bit healthier and i eliminated the meat however i have no doubt that had i used the flour and butter roux it would have made the soup even richer and tastier i was happy to find a cheese soup recipe that didnt use broccoli since one of my family members doesnt like it i did double the recipe and it was very good that being said heres what i did i put the onion celery and carrots and cup of broth in the soup pot and simmered for minutes i then added the potatoes the rest of the broth the basil and parsley and simmered for another minutes until the potatoes were done to thicken the soup i then mixed some chicken broth and cornstarch in a cup and added that to the brothveggies mix stirring constantly i heated the milk and velveeta in the microwave stirring occasionally until the cheese was mostly melted i added the cheesemilk mix after the potatoes were cooked i did not add any salt and i did not use the sour cream i ended up with a delicious soup that was a bit healthier and i served it in homemade bread bowls very very good
4,i made this soup but added cup of cooked bacon and tablespoon bacon drippings my family devoured it
4,good but i think i prefer my guinness chocolate cheesecake
4,ive made this cake times and its fallen every time has it happened to you and do you have any advice how to keep it from falling we love the cake and the frosting hides the hole in the middle
4,this recipe was a nice surprise the cake was moist and had a good balance of both chocolate and guinness tastes i also added half heavy cream and half baileys to the frosting but i think next time i will try something else it was ok tasting but i didnt exactly love it either next time i think a little powdered sugar sprinkled on top may taste good all by itself i dont think you really need the frosting at all thank you for this wonderful beer cake recipe
4,served this cake for st pat day partymy husband tried to sneak a piece to take home but got caught and lost it to marilyn it was very good
4,really good easy thats if you have guinness handy
4,this cake is amazing if youre looking for a healthier but equally delicious version of this cake though be sure to check it out
4,it is a challenge to bake long enough but not overbake and cause cake to dry out otherwise our family liked this cake made it for our st pats day meal and my son thought a little baileys to the topping would have been great i liked the cake as is
4,very moist cake made using a cupcake pan without cupcake papers then and topped with strawberries and ganache using oz of semisweet choc amp cup heavy whip cream melted in pan i then hand dipped each cupcake and served in a cupcake foil looked and tasted awesome
4,very moist cake has a hint of the guinness stout flavor great cake to celebrate irish
4,this was a good dense cake the surprise on my familys faces when i told them the secret ingredient was priceless thanks for sharing
4,not a good cake for children the taste of the guinness was a bit too strong
4,can i substitute pepsicoca cola for the beer
4,i used yougart instead of buttermilk and spiced it up with nutmeg and cinnamon delicious n moist
4,this is awesome i may add a little cayenne to kick it up a notch but really good just the way it is
4,pvery good yummmmp
4,we liked this soup it had a good start to the flavor i did add more salt and pepper than was called for i made few other changes too i sauteed the chopped onion in some of the bacon fat before i added the chicken broth i heated up the milk before adding it to the hot broth and potatoes so it wouldnt curdle when added finally i pureed the soup before adding the cheese it came out very creamy and smooth that way
4,i added more pepper and used shredded cheese and i threw all in the crock pot super easy and very good would make again
4,i added a rib of celery and used half the amount of velveeta i added oz shredded sharp cheddar for more authentic cheese flavor i had fresh parsley on hand so i used that instead of dried i think a garnish of chives would be even better than green onions
4,very moist and light cakelike not dense like the usual banana bread i had to bake for the full minto get it to spring back in the center
4,found this recipe years ago in a taste of home cookbook and became a family favorite i sometimes sub diced smoked sausage for the bacon and its insanely decadent
4,pretty good very thick
4,this was just as delicious as it was easy i substituted plain greek yogurt for the sour cream i will definitely make it again a little goes a long way very filling
4,i recently found out that i am sensitive to gluten and wanted to make a banana bread after reading the reviews i decided to make this one and it was pretty good the only changes i made to the recipe was i used cup of brown sugar instead of cup of white sugar and i used pecans instead of walnuts it wasnt the best banana bread ive had but it was pretty good im going to make it one more time following the recipe exactly and see if it comes out better
4,ive been making this soup since the early s of course its better with bacon my husband likes to top his with a dollop of sour cream
4,fixed this just as recipe stated but it was missing something it tasted fine but just wasnt quite there did some research and added a stick of buttermade all the difference now it is a great recipe for me
4,oh my goodness creamy and comforting will make often this winter
4,this soup is delicious but be aware that all the dicing cubing peeling chopping and grating is very time consuming
4,i would cut the amount of onions down a bit if your not a big fan and doubletriple the amount of salt and pepper and if youre looking for just a bit more of a spicy and creaminess i would add cups of perpper jack and colby jack less than half a cup of colby
4,this is good recipe i prepared it last night
4,thank you for this recipe i was surprised to see a recipe in taste of home from some one in sweet valley pa i lived there from to and graduated from lake lehman high school it is my most favorite place i have ever lived
4,how much cheese is to be added in the recipe doesnt say i played with the amount myself very good tho
4,to finish my review it always gets cut in half
4,soup was awesome would definitely make it again i used cup shredded cheddar instead of velvetta i just added it to the butter flour mixture and added the milk too then later i added another cup of cheddar cheese soup was not too salty i actually had to add more salt than what the recipe called for also i would definitely not add the sour cream at all i tried the soup before adding sour cream and it was much better than after
4,very moist and denseyum didnt really taste the guinness though so easy to make
4,loved the cake made it without frosting and it was decadent and rich just has a hint of malt flavor from the guinness this cake is going to be a new addition to our yearly march menu for sure twelve servings makes for a very large piece of very rich cake i think you could get at least servings ive also seen this cake with a peanut butter cream cheese frosting and that sounds yummy
4,my family loved this cake it wasnt to chocolate for them i didnt add the cream to the frosting and it was just right yes it is a thick and heavy but they liked it
4,this is a very good recipe but i changed a few things here is what i did amp it turned out delicious pds of skinless chicken cups of broth i use better than bouillon chicken flavored its in a jar love this stuff cup of heavy whipping cream stalks of celery small sweet onion teaspoons of minced garlic tea cumin tea oragano cups of shredded cheddar cheese salt amp pepper cans of northern kidney beans boiled chicken shredded the chicken added everything in crock pot then added instant mash potatoes it works great on thicken the sauce plus great taste sprinkle some in stir thickens instantly i just judge the thickness cover amp cook on high for hrs it makes a lot so im sure i will be sharing with family or freezing some
4,its a great recipe people who want to change the recipe then write it on your reviews should get their own web page youre supposed to be rating this recipe not your own
4,i would not slow cook chicken breast for several hours thoughno point saute for minutes and add to the beans at the end and leave for about minutes to cook through otherwise a nice change from the usual i had a similar dish in arizona and it was surprisingly good
4,pany ideas for nonalcoholic substitute for the beer in this recipep
4,very good it is moist and fairly dense the icing sets if off and compliments the chocolate there is just a hint of the guinness in it so you know it isnt just your ordinary chocolate cake i would make it again
4,very good it was a bit runny and i will probably mash another can of beans for thickening and maybe add a can of chopped green chiles next time all in all we loved it
4,we really enjoyed the flavor of this dish it was a little more like soup than chili but that did not bother us i will definitely make this again super fast and tasty meal
4,easy recipe it tasted really good excellent flavor my only issue was that it was more soup than chili which many other reviewers said it would be nice if it were quite a bit thicker then i would have given it stars i did really like it and i will probably monkey with the recipe some more
4,a very easy and excellent recipe its not going to be that thick chiliconsistency but the heat level is nice and kidfriendly as advertised i made a few slight alterations i used about lb of chicken and additional can of beans since we like our chilies and soups on the chunkier side i reduced the broth to cups and used liquid from the canned beans when i crushed the cup of beans as directed though i did this with a fork so it wasnt perfectly smooth the flavors are a nice blend although i think i will increase the oregano and cumin to compensate for having more chicken and beans next time the additions of cheese avocado and cherry tomatoes are delicious and oyster crackers are good too my very picky son ate seconds unprompted definitely a winner in my book
4,loved it very easy to prepare not much prep time and delicious definitely will have it again soon
4,i used a whole egg since i did not have egg substitute my kids did hnot like the tomato mixture but my husband and i enjoyed it all would like adding balsamic to it next time as another reviewer suggested
4,the crispy texture reminded of fried chicken but without the guilt we like our parmesan cheese a bit more than the average person so we used the large pencilsharpnersized pieces of parmesan what really made this dish appetizing was the way in which the tomatoes were a bit carmelizedthis contrasted nicely with the crisp coating based on the flavor alone you would never guess that this would be considered a lowcalorie entréesubmitted by michel d harris taste of home field editor
4,i thought this tasted great im watching the carbs and it was a great way to omit the bread in traditioanl bruschetta and still get the flavor
4,good flavor
4,this recipe is fantastic by itself i have played around with it a little bit and i like adding swissamerican cheese before adding the tomatoes it melts so well and gives a creamy texture to the dish swissamerican cheese can be found at any local grocery store its comes in sandwich squares another idea is rather then chicken you can to fish my family likes grouper rather then coat the whole fish i season it and mix italian bread crumbs with melted butter and put that mixture only on top of the fish and add the swiss chesse and diced tomatoes from a can that i drain very well cook it for minutes or so or until it flakes and it turns out fantastic
4,this is good son wasnt thrilled with it but thats cause he doesnt like tomatoes
4,i definitely added a little extra garlic since i love it and i used a can of diced tomatoes which i wouldnt normally do but fresh tomatoes havent been looking that great lately it turned out pretty decent maybe a little more watery than it would have been with the fresh tomatoes i definitely plan on trying fresh next time it wasnt super crispy but i wasnt really expecting it to be anyways it was definitely soggy as leftovers but the flavor was still decent
4,this was a very tasty recipe i didnt have any fresh tomatoes on hand so i used canned and it worked out just fine
4,yum easy to make and is a satisfying dinner i quickly made it on a weeknight too i love garlic but my husband would prefer it be cut in half in the recipe id probably consider it in the future especially when serving it to company
4,this recipe was easy to make and pretty good but just didnt have all that much flavor i dont think id make again
4,super good i will agree with some of the reviews that it is on the salty side but kendya gave great suggestions on how to cut down on some of the sodium content ill definitely keep this recipe
4,this was good not great omitted the onions and added more cheese and breadcrumbs it came out a little runny but that could have been my fault as i probably could have left it in the oven longer probably will need to tweak a bit more
4,salty i doubled the recipe and used only teaspoons of salt in total and it was still way too much these are good but the salt is distracting
4,im eating these potatoes as im typing cut the recipe in half as its just my husband and i taste good i put less salt in it as the cheese i used was a little salty worked out perfectly in the last minutes of bake time i raised the temperature to degrees i like my potatoes golden then i sprinkled on more cheese a blend of cheddar and monterey jack until golden think next time i might add some finely diced ham and parsley or sprinkle with crispy crumbled bacon
4,super easy and oh so delish if you are pressed for time but need a great side dish try semi boiling your potatoes while making your sauce cuts the time down significantly also you can boil your potatoes in chicken broth for extra flavor
4,good basic recipe i will tweek this to make it el paso and corbell family perfect for us thanks for a great start
4,very good flavor but a bit heavy on the onion in following the recipe exactly i felt there was too much sauce which can easily be remedied by adding another potato or two to soak up more of the sauce next time i may add a minced clove of garlic as someone else suggested to see how that tastes as well as cut back a bit on the onion otherwise a very good side dish that was fairly easy to make
4,first time making this recipe the neighbors that i shared it with and myself said it was really good it had good flavor and the potatoes were perfect i usually share with my friends when trying new recipes i like the way this recipe is put together
4,very good
4,very good recipe didnt call for anything out of the ordinary pretty simple dish to make
4,this was very good comfort food is what my daughter called it i used a full lb of ground beef and added a few drops of sriracha sauce i will be making this again
4,nice for something different
4,it was very easy to make and it was pretty good felt like it could use some more flavor
4,nice change have made this twice amp will make it again
4,you should cook the potatoes st
4,the recipe is a good starting point four stars only because it really does need to be tweaked first it is yet anoth recipe for a family of six im retired and ofteen cook for myself alone my wife prefers other things so down to one really big russet potato put through the mandolin at an eighthinch setting then cut into smaller pieces second the sauce as described and then scale down is too thick i found myself addding more ½amp½ more cream flavor and not so fatty as heavy cream third cheddar is nice but i also threw in some storebought cheese pizza cheese i also used some on top during the uncovered baking time nice lightly browned top fourth imade this a onedish meal a layer of sauce a layer of potato a bit more sauce and a layer of sliced baked ham a bit more sauce another layer of potatoes and the rest of the sauce the baking instructions adjusted a bit for a convection oven were spot on the covered cooking time i added the extra chees on top then did the uncovered baking time again adjusted downward for a convection oven a quick and gentle stire after a short time sitting just after coming out brought the sauce together neatly and the result was very satisfactory
4,this recipe is a great au gratin base we use a little extra cheese on top and add some fresh herbs for the one star review you have it backwards scalloped potatoes do not have cheese au gratin potatoes do also these are plenty tender if you follow the directions of cooking for hour covered and then an additional minutes uncovered no need to precook unless you would like to avoid the first hour of covered cooking
4,i followed this recipe exactly i think people that have included in their review that the potatoes were not cooked enough did not interpret the recipe correctly i believe the recipe could be more clearly written that after you cook covered for hour you then remove the cover and cook for an additional minutes that is plenty of time the potatoes were quite soft you definitely do not need to precook the potatoes first that is a waste of every working persons limited time do be aware that you need to set aside at least two hours of time to prepare cook and cool this dish i liked it a lot but would add a bit more than the cup of cheese the next time
4,was easy but i thought it needed more flavor
4,super easy to do i added garlic powder for some flavor and more pepper than was called for i baked at for minutes more like as i didnt hear the timer right away and they were perfect the family loved them ill be adding this as a regular recipe to pull out for a side
4,i added ketchup mustardand chopped up pickles and it rocked id leave the potatoes out next time or else chop then up really tiny
4,i doubled this recipe and it came out soupy so i added leftover mashed potatoes i think if leftover mashed potatoes arent on hand id try potato flakes to thicken it up
4,we enjoyed this recipe i followed the recipe as written except i added another cup of cheese on top and let them brown for us it needed a bit more seasoning and onions
4,really quick and easy sauce to make but after an hour had to turn my oven up to to get my potatoes to cook my husband loved them and i will use this recipe again
4,i love this made a big batch and am going to take it for lunch all week healthy yummy and you can control the spice
4,this has great flavor but chili is misleading it is more like a soup with a chili flavor i did add a second can of beans mashed to give it a bit more thickness and my son and i like a little more heat so i used all of the jalepeno pepper seeds and all very tasty and nice for a cold night
4,need to leave the jalapeno out when the kids are here otherwise it was great
4,cooking for two so cut recipe in half used canned chilies it was excellent
4,i used a qt dutch oven covered in a degree oven for about an hour and a half to cook then i added masa harina corn flour to thicken it up a bit just cup or so mixed with a cup of water to make a paste during the last minutes of cooking move the pan to the top of the stove to better monitor the chili towards the end i thought it was pretty good
4,this chili has really good flavor its a little soupy i ended up having to strain out some of the broth and mash all the stuff together though not to a pulp i added tomatillos diced up in it i used a poblano pepper instead of a jalapeno which is an idea if you want a mellow spiciness rather than a sharp spiciness so other than it being soupy pretty awesome
4,this was pretty good i only used c of broth because of the soupy comments seemed like a good ratio i didnt detect any spiciness off of this and neither did my yr old so if you want it spicy i suggest using some seeds or some serrano chilies
4,this dish had a great flavor and was easy to make but i ended up with more of a soup than a chili next time i make it im using of the suggested liquids and im making it on the stove rather than in the crockpot so it has a chance to simmer down a bit
4,this was really good i omitted the cheese and sour cream and served it with cornbread mmmm
4,i dont know if it was just me but mine was more like a thin chicken soup than a chunky chili like i was expecting it did taste good and my family enjoyed it but i probably wont be making again i have other similar recipes that i prefer more
4,chili was too runny add some flour or corn starch to thicken it
4,i made this without the jalapeno since my granddaughter doesnt like anything too spicy after serving her i added about cup medium spice green chilies otherwise the chili was too bland for our tastes
4,great but not extraordinary
4,i really like the idea of the pumpkin and it does thicken the chili nicely but i also found the chili to be a little bland it really needs a little more salt chili powder and a bit of sweetness to bring out the flavors and enhance the pumpkin so i added t of franks hot sauce a bit more chili powder t of packed dark brown sugar and splenda packets to sweeten a bit more but not wreck the nutritional value of the recipe chili and the intensity of flavors is a personal preference ive modified the recipe to our familys preferences i will make this again thanks for the great idea
4,i love this recipe but it definitely needs more spices i added more chili powder garlic powder and salt this will definitely become a fall staple
4,delicious yes i did tweak the spices cut back to cup chicken broth to make it chunkier amp left out the turkey to make it very lowcal but it was good just add more spice tastes like a spicy butternutsquash soupi even thought i might use my immersion blender amp process it very smooth lots of ideas with this basic soup
4,i used ground turkey added a oz can of green chilies and another teaspoon of chili powder took it to a chili cookoff and it came in nd place many compliments on it
4,i didnt use the chicken broth i used a large can of crushed tomatoes a spicy can of diced tomatoes along with extra spices sugar the taste is a bit bland wo the extra ingredients oh and lots of hot sauce
4,i think i would try chicken next time i would have liked a bit stronger pumpkin flavor as well i tossed in a dash of cinammon which added a nice flavor
4,i made this with ground beef instead of turkey red beans instead of blacks and added more salt and other seasonings some southwest chipotle seasoning additional cumin and chili powder than the reciped indicated very hearty and filling we liked it very much served with shredded cheddar on top we will definately have this again
4,delicious and super easy made the house smell great on a frigid winter day
4,th only thing i will change is the basil i would cut the amount in half i also will experiment and sub oregano for the basil
4,excellent but i think half and half heavy cream would of been better along with a bit of salt or some type of seasoning but overall fantastic
4,excellent recipe altered the timing but over all great thanks for sharing
4,use rotel tomatoes instead of reg to add more spice
4,yum
4,this was a very flavorful chili i used ground turkey and a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies it could easily be adapted to ground beef as well if that is your preference i would definitely make this chili again
4,delicious and the pumpkin gave it a different flavor
4,unique and very tasty
4,based on previous reviews that it was too soupy cut the chicken broth to cups also substituted oz can rotel original plus of oz can tomato sauce for the diced tomatoes used rotisserie chicken instead of turkey and replaced the yellow pepper with celery garnished with sour cream and crushed tortilla chips didnt really taste the pumpkin as much as it just gave it a wonderful earthy taste the whole family loved it
4,good fall soup
4,i made this soup and my whole family loved it it was easy to made and plan to make it often the only think i changed was put in a little more cheese sharp cheddar as we love cheese
4,this gave me a very good starting recipe to work with for cheeseburger soup because i am feeding adults i used a full pound of ground beef and oz of velveeta and pounds of potatoes i am not a fan of the carrots and celery in this soup so i left them out and added garlic powder a little cayenne powder i also used cup of heavy cream and cup of whole milk to have a little more richness in the soupi will make this soup many more times thank you so much for the recipe
4,make some bacon and crumble it on top of the soup before serving delicious
4,knew from the start this recipe needed to be doubled added lb chickenbeef meatballs sliced in half plus about c petite mixed frozen vegetables mins before serving along with a whole wheat hard roll nummy nummy in my tummy
4,i prepared this dish for a holiday gettogether and received great feedback
4,i have made this multiple times the first few times i made it i only used cans of chicken broth and substituted tomato puree or paste for the canned tomatoes this recipe is a little tricky just because if you dont have a good balance of spice the pumpkin can be a little funky if youre not a huge pumpkin fan my family really likes it and overall they are generally picky eaters
4,added a beer hot sauce extra cup of cheddar and chicken broth to give it the kick we wanted served with baguette
4,my family loves corn so i knew i had to try this recipe we all liked it but thought it was sweeter than it needed to be next time ill decrease the sugar by half
4,this was good i used steak instead of turkey and added chipotle powder it was a nice change from our usual chili recipe
4,i changed this recipe up a great deal first i had half a bag of frozen home style meatballs i didnt know how i was going to use so substituted them for the turkey then i thought the spice was too strong so i added another cup of broth it still needed toning down so i added half and half to taste it really turned out quite well i will just use less cumin next time
4,sounds great the photo looks like there are avacado chunks in the soup
4,very easy and quite filling its the perfect chili for autumnwinter
4,i like the idea of adding pumpkin to chili and i enjoyed this recipe after i added lots more chili powder i like more heat than this recipe called for
4,i made this and my family devoured it only substitutions because of what i had on hand were chicken tenders for turkey fire roasted diced tomatoes gave a little extra kick and home made veggie broth that i had frozen previously in place of the chicken broth this is a great tasting soupstew and i will be making it again
4,really good tastes like a southwestern chili will make again
4,yum we enjoyed this very much i used lean ground turkey breast instead of the cubed cooked turkey but made no other changes dont worry if you like my husband arent a big fan of pumpkin you really cant taste it at all it just adds fiber and nutrients and helps to thicken the chili bonus for weight watchers followers a generous serving is very low in points and very filling try it
4,dh and i liked it but my kids wouldnt even try it it was really good though kind of labor intensive though
4,my family all loved this i added a lb hamburger but my year old said it needed more next time i will add more but it was very good
4,very tasty and kid friendly
4,ive been making a variation of this for years my husband loves ittip its way easier to add the extra butter and then the flour to the celery and onion mixture than it is to make a separate roux you have more control over how thick your soup will be and you dont have to mess up an extra pan its an extra step thats very unnecessary
4,i found this recipe to be lacking something so i threw in a few extra things and it turned out pretty well i used only tsp oregano instead of garlic cloves i used garlic powder i also added a handful of spinach and some wild rice i added a little of a seasoning blend and added fresh ground pepper
4,i love this chili the only change i made was to add a jalapeno with the seeds my brotherinlaw was asking me the other day to make that soup meaning chili that has the white beans ha so i guess ill make it again thank you
4,make with a few modifications to make it a little thicker and spicier since our family likes spicy
4,i doubled this and used can of black beans in place of the kidney beans i also cooked chicken tenderloins and then shredded them before i added them to the chili served it with cheesy italian monkey bread the flavor was great my only complaint was that with the broth it was a thinner consistency than what i was hoping for and i guess i didnt mash my beans enough to make it thicker otherwise we really liked it
4,atlanta is iced in and my husband is saying not chicken again but he really liked this recipe didnt have jalapeno pepper so added diced tomato wjalapeno peppers put beans in blender to crush used can would double amount next time to try to make thicker didnt have time to slow cook cooked on stove for minutes and ate with garlic asiago bread yumm
4,i doubled the recipe for superbowl threw in some roasted corn and a oz jar of light alfredo sauce made it thicker and creamier
4,very easy to make i did not use the jalapenos or cilantro but it was still absolutely tasty and filling my husband is not a bean person and he loved it which says a lot since he only likes meat and cheese i would definitely make this again
4,very good
4,my husband has banned me from calling this chili but rather soup i doubled everything in the recipe for my larger slowcooker and then cut out cup of liquid it still came out soupy and i think i would cut out another cup next time stille very good for a cold day when all you want is soup ready right when you get home if you like things spicer dont seed the chili and add more
4,far too sweet for our tastes even with the sugar cut in half next time i will eliminate the sugar altogether and add some salt pepper and maybe onion powder however it rose beautifully and was light and fluffy
4,i made the recipe as written and it was very good but i agree with other reviewers that it is too sweet next time i make it i will cut back on the sugar and may add some sauteed onions andor grated cheddar cheese
4,this is very similar the recipe ive used for years except mine does not include the sugar it also doesnt have the milk use undrained whole kernel corn for the liquid and it specifies to put the corn bread mix in last always a huge hit wherever i take it its my goto recipe when i need something that mixes up quickly star review because ive never made this recipe
4,i really didnt want to rate this because i have not tried this specific recipe i just see people saying that it takes a long time to set i make one similar i dont use the eggs milk or sugar and it turns out great takes about an hour at doubling the recipe will make it take about minutes longer i use half a box of jiffy corn muffing mix with the corn sour cream and butter
4,i wouldnt really call this a corn pudding it is a really great cornbread though i love the texture and sweetness of this
4,fixed this for the first time for a church party and was asked for the recipe and my hub and said this was a keeper a similar recipe lacked the rich flavor this does definitely a pudding
4,as written this is way too sweet so after making this several times decided to go savory with the flavors and it was just rightwe left out the sugar completely added about cup diced onion a scant cup minced canned jalapeos and about cup sharp cheddar all the rest remained the same it did take another ish minutes bake time
4,four stars because i made so many substitutions but this is an easy recipe that adapts well to different tastes i went the savory route used only t sugar added c chopped onion and chopped jalapeno sprinkled cheddar cheese on top the last few minutes of baking wow was it good
4,works great even with the quarter cup of oil i had to substitute for an egg because i only had one egg left also added half teaspoon of salt and baked just a bit longer than the recommend cooking time because i like mine a bit more firm all told i think this is a pretty foolproof recipe if you like corn and cornbread you cant go wrong with this recipe
4,i make this without sugar or milk and it is definitely sweet enough just took it to a church potluck and i was asked for the recipe
4,a very pleasing side dish to complete a meal because quite a few of the comments mentioned the dish being sweet i cut the sugar down to cup and i would probably use only in the future
4,pretty good recipe i made mine lowfat lowcalorie ground turkey no butter but tbps when sauteeing veggies velvetta rf sour cream skim milk etc would make again but add about oz more cheese this time i didnt think it was cheesy enough tasted better the next day heated up
4,very good modified with turkey and added a can of italian diced tomatoes only drawback is that its a lot of prep time
4,i dont think i cooked it long enough the cake tasted delicious but i think it could of cooked a little longer have made it with and without sauce and either way it is a winner
4,cake turned out very well moist and good taste i added nuts to the batter there is an awful lot of sugar in this recipe have another recipe for apple cake that i like better would make again because my husband loved it
4,i made this it was pretty good i only used cup of sugar and it was still way too sweet ill omit the sugar next time id consider this a dessert rather than a side dish but its good note if you make this with cheese it will be slightly less firmer than without so you may want to lessen a liquid ingredient maybe the milk
4,absolute breeze wonderfully tasty dont be afraid of the brown i thought i accidentally left it in too long but the middle was just nicely set and the edges were a lovely dark crispy brown with a nice bit of browning across the entire top
4,i use a similar recipe with no sugar or milk and only egg the center is not supposed to set this recipe is for corn casserole not corn bread think of it as a bread pudding texture very moist is what makes it so good
4,i made this recipe when we were both under the weather i thought it had a very good flavor but i substituted cup of heavy cream for part of the milk i left out the basil but added garlic i went a little lighter on the salt and im glad i di i used real cheese instead of velveeta and fewer potatoes the next time i make it im going to add at least strips of bacon chopped fine and maybe a hit of dijon mustard to keep it cheeseburgery
4,love how easy this is to make but way too sweet at a half a cup of sugar also bake at or like other recipes suggest after mins at center still jiggles
4,very good and simple to prepare the only change i made was not adding the cream corn and instead cans of whole corn i would take the advice from others and increase the temperature to at the center was not done
4,first time i made this as written and it was a bit too sweet for my taste so next time i omitted the sugar jiffy mix already contains sugar and it was stars i have since made it as a texmex side with the addition of a can of green chilies topped with pepper jack cheese i also baked at degrees for minutes in order for it to set lynne volunteer field editor
4,i have already made this recipe for a long time i dont like to add as much sugar and i like to use fresh corn when i can i have made it more like a main coarse and added green chilies and cooked hamburger ham or sausage and then then added choice of cheese i have also seen people keep in the sugar and serve it as a desert with ice cream i also cook mine at degrees for at least minutes i like it to be a little bit brown on the top that way you know it is done all the way through
4,solid recipe and one certainly worth keeping in your stash we live in co and i may have to tweak the recipe for our altitude but the taste is certainly there i made my loaves into muffins and added choc chips to half the muffins thanks for sharing
4,is the nutrtional content available
4,i will make this again for the flavor was very good i gave it only four stars instead of because i thought it was a little too soupy i think when i make it again i will add an extra can of beans and probably a pound of chicken overall though this recipe is very good
4,delicious i followed recipe except didnt add beans because i didnt have them used hot salsa and refried beans as the bottom layer i made a bit of extra sauce we always prefer flour tortillas for enchiladas for us its not an enchilada if it isnt a flour tortilla so creamy and yummy
4,very good the only change i made was adding sauteed jalapeno to the salsa mixture just because we like it spicy and i had them in the garden i will definitely make it again
4,i made this recipe and the filling and sauce were delicious however the flour tortillas did get soggy and gummy next time definitely use corn tortillas
4,this is an easy recipe to follow i substituted black beans for pinto beans i used a can of rotel tomatoes instead of the salsa i also added sauteed onions as well ive used flour tortillas in the past and they were gummy taste much better using corn tortillas
4,so let me start off by saying that the enchilada filling itself is stars very very good definitly different than what my mom made growing up chicana but sooo good i rated because using flour tortillas just isnt a good idea if you want nice crispy enchiladas i would consider using flour tortillas more of a wet burrito type dish they get soggy i used corn tortillas instead and a bit of advice that makes a world of difference is lightly frying your corn tortillas in oil on each side before placing filling in and rolling makes them more durable and much more crispy to hold up against the sauce and for the sauce if you like it a bit spicy even if not they have regular sauce i recommend el pato you can usally find in the mexican section of any store i use the yellow or green cans both delcious also i chopped up white onion and put on top of the enchiladas before spreading cheese i also baked uncovered for an extra mins to get the edges extra crispy mi familia loves it this way served with a simple red rice my mom used to make and it was delicious also i did use cubed chicken because i used some left over breasts from the night prior but i will definitly be shredding it next time my family didnt really dig that all in all i love the filling recipe very very good will be keeping this one thank you
4,the whole family loves this bread as a breakfast item or a midnight snack sliced a half inch thick toasted with a little butter its heaven on a platei would have given stars but i think cups sugar is too much cut back on the pure cane a bit and this bread is a winner
4,i took the suggestion of one of the readers and used a toffee bar instead of the nuts wonderful flavor but even though the pan was sprayed the candy sunk to the bottom of it amp i mean it stuck most of it had to be soaked off next time i will do it without the toffee bar
4,while the recipe is simple the cake was very sweet i would reduce the sugar to cups
4,the cake was moist and good and the sauce made it even better i used cups of sugar and that worked perfectly
4,good flavor and texture followed recommendation to reduce sugar i did cup white sugar and c brown sugar also nutmeg flavor seems a little strong i would reduce and possibly increase cinnamon if necessary make sure you choose to use tart apples to get the best flavor
4,i found the recipe way too sweet i will definitely repeat it but ill do cup of sugar instead everything else was great that would be my best advice
4,i love apple cake and have struggled to find one that i really like and would make again this is it it is also versatile you can add a little less sugar more or less of your spices with or without a topping it is really good with a scoop of ice cream i found it was a decadent dessert with a praline sauce drizzled over it
4,i didnt put the sauce on because butterscotch flavour is my least favourite but the cake was very yummy without it bewared tho i didnt use apples from the store and i mixed up my eating apples with the ones meant for cider almost didnt turn out
4,this is a recipe i would definitely make again i made a few changes and used ground turkey breast and shredded sharp cheddar cheese instead of velvetta it got rave reviews from my family
4,lilaccrew directions statecheeseburger souptell us what you think of this recipedid you modify it would you make it again and what of your statement is a review very good recipe as is but due for health reasons our family too has since found ways to modify it to meet our needs similar to those buzzbombz posted
4,four stars for overabundance of fat sodium content uninteresting seasoningsthought suggestions might be welcome since soup is basically the same name and the different ingredients could offer some flexibility its such a simple recipe i never thought to submit it thanks chocoholiclady for understanding the comments amp reasoninglessened the attack
4,this soup is delicious but i only gave it stars because it is so much work i have found an easier version made in the crockpot that i will make from now on
4,my five kids absolutely loved this twist on potato soup
4,this was very good but does take a bit of time and dishes to prepare i used only tbsp of butter and less flour and broth i added cup queso fresco cheese and we like that a lot i am thrilled to know how to make this great red sauce
4,i made this for my family they did enjoy it i however altered the recipe by adding garlic salt and garlic powder to taste the sauce seemed to taste just like tomatoes to me so it needed tweaking i also dont buy beef broth i made my own with beef base and water maybe that was the difference anyway already had one request for this again we love mexican inspired dishes
4,the enchiladas were good but i was expecting to be wowwed after reading all the reviews and i wasnt maybe it really makes a difference as to how much of the spices was used i put in the minimum amount when it said to tsp or tablespoons maybe i should have put in the full amount i have other enchiladas recipes i like better but i might make this again well see how the leftovers taste tomorrow
4,my kids really liked these
4,first of all i have been making this cake for years it is an all time favorite of mine next there are a few speedboats you hit while making for example the batter is very thick honestly its more the consistency of cookie dough dont try to use a hand mixer on this it will break been there done that the reason for that though is all the liquid that is in the apples will cook out and mix with the batter while baking its supposed to be like that next it is very sweet if you use anything other than a tart apple i always go straight for the big granny smiths anything else just adds together to make a sugary overload last the end result is a very moist very heavy cake best if eaten quickly even better if warm it will not last more than a couple of days pairs beautifully with some vanilla icecream cinnamon and caramel never actually used the butterscotch sauce part of the recipe never felt it was the right kind of flavor makes for a fantastic breakfast or dessert and its perfect for those cool autumn nights and brisk winter mornings
4,this apple cake is good i added walnuts and raisins as some suggested i didnt make the butterscotch sauce i bought a bottle of caramel sauce for topping if youre not eating the whole cake right away the homemade sauce didnt seem like a good idea
4,husband liked this cake however i thought it was too heavy and dense after the first day best eaten first day when very fresh
4,made this soup tonight the family loved it will definitely put it in the cookbook to make again thanks
4,our kids and i love this recipe but my husband isnt crazy about it for some reason i make this on nights he has to work
4,i made it for a work fundraiser and it was a big hit i will make it again but we did add some extra seasonings
4,make a similar version using ground turkey worchestershire sauce touch of chili powder or tabasco garlic sm can of rotel diced tomatoes bag of frozen corn and oz bag of lowfat mexican shredded cheese added toward end dont need the flour with natural starch from corn amp potatoes very hearty comfort food great with corn bread
4,these were really good kids ate them without complaining so thats a win
4,this was a great chicken recipethank yousonny
4,so delicious as instructed flour tortillas did not get gummy or soggy like some people feared in fact restaurants prepare them similarly easy to make for such flavor
4,this is very tasty and truly simple used leftover roasted chicken tomatillo salsa and about double the amt of enchilada sauce this is a keeper
4,this recipe comes together quickly with leftover chicken the salsa and cream cheese makes an interesting base you can kick it up with pepper jack cheese and fresh peppers i really enjoyed chopped fresh tomatoes and green onions on top
4,super easy and really goodi use fat cream cheese black beans fresh chopped jalepeno peppers whole wheat tortillas and pepper jack cheese everything else i left the same i serve with light sour cream and some jasmine rice and my hubby and i love it
4,these were really good simple and fast i served them with my new favorite rice viggo mexican rice
4,these were really good i love the combination of bananas and cream cheese so i knew that i would like these and yes i certainly did i prefer a bit more texture so i added some chopped walnuts to the bars and they turned out great that way
4,little confused on why it says that it makes dozen should i only pour half the batter in and then make again found this to be more cakelike than barlike i also put it in for minutes because the middle was too puddinglike though i was nervous about the browning edges i live at highaltitude if thats relevant overall an easy winner to take to work or a family gathering i put salted caramel in the cream cheese frosting which was amazing i will try enhancing it even more with another banana or some almonds next time
4,i really liked this recipes cause it only has mg of sodium and when u go to make this use unsalted butter i added some applesauce and some roasted pecans and every loved it
4,these were really goodi dont have much experience with cooking mexican food but i work with several hispanic ladies and they said i would probably like using white corn tortillasivwill definitely be making these againas for the sodium police we can all read the nutritional values for ourselves and decide to cookor not cook so myob
4,a little salty for me but hubby really liked it
4,my mom has been making these for years theyre a little spicy for me because my heat tolerance is slim to none but i still love them i cut the spice with a bit of sour cream on top theyre very filling so we usually only eat a half of one enchilada and then serve with some rice or chips and salsa they feed a crowd that way
4,i agree with some of the other reviewers the extra tsp of salt is not needed its already salty from the beef broth also i would use corn tortillas like the texture better not so soft like the flour and i would omit the garlic to me thats not really authentic mexican think ill add jalapeno instead also sauce did taste a bit floury was good but think ill keep looking for a more authentic mexican recipe and was not bland at all i dont know where some of these ppls taste buds are
4,good meal different than traditional enchiladas the garlic taste makes it more unique
4,my family liked this dish i might add less flour to the sauce next time seemed very mild to me in flavor but the dish went together well and froze well a keeper
4,very tasty however and before any of you point it out yes i saw the name of the recipe lol i will say i will put in less garlic next time so that the other flavors can shine as well loved it and loved not using a canned sauce deff in our dinner rotations
4,this was a nice change from my other enchiladas and enchilada casserole recipes the sauce was a little thick and i could still taste the flour which may be my fault may have needed to let it cook a little longer the were even better the next day for leftover lunches and cold i will make them again but they will never replace my other enchiladas
4,very good my friend thought he would prefer it with a little less cheese
4,i just got done making this for dinner tonight i used italian sausge meat as well with ground beef turned out good
4,these were better than i expected i had to make some changes because i didnt have everything once i started i followed the recipe except i subbed chili powder for chili seasoning from the packets i used fresh tomatoes and a little bit of pace salsa to equal the stewed tomatoes i skipped the sage and used the upper portions of each seasoning and added a llittle cayenne pepper oh and i also had to used cheddar cheese i heated the tortillas beforeassembling too it was so good
4,this was very good but does take a bit of time and dishes to prepare i added cup queso fresco cheese and we like that a lot i am thrilled to know how to make a great red sauce
4,didnt change a thing turned out delicious next time i wont cut the potatoes too small like someone suggested
4,the dish was pretty good i added some leftover rice i found in the fridge as a filler and it was nice next time id add corn and black beans to the filling a few notes i wasnt too crazy about the sauce found it to be quite bland and needing to triple the seasoning it was also way too thick and clumpy i ended up adding water to thin it out i also added a bit of brown sugar to cut the salt and acidity next time i would half the amount of salt on its own it was way too salty thankfully the toppings masked the saltiness this also makes a huge batch of sauce i have enough to last me more occasions
4,very tasty but too much salt i reduced the amount but next time will add no additional salt i really liked the flavor of the sauce and look forward to having again i topped with black olives and chopped jalapenos
4,made for our family of two kids and two adults we are garlic lovers so this recipe stood out to me everyone ate it although nobody was rushing to get a second helping i thought the sauce was tasty and the dish overall was a solid recipe that said for the time it took to put together i didnt think it was really worth it i made on a weeknight and dinner was served later than usual for the time it took to compose i likely wouldnt make again
4,it worked fine for me i used half very thick caramel topping and half caramel sundae syrup because thats what i had and it worked fine i baked mine for minutes then turned off the oven for about more minutes my oven runs hot compared to these recipes but sometimes things arent done in the middle so this is my compromise i wasnt sure what you meant by topping either sounds like a cheaper brand of topping and not syrup will have the caramel sink to the bottom i kind of have an issue with toh in general in that this takes way more than minutes to make in general your recipes all the ingredients are prepared pecans chopped cream cheese softened and then you start the timer i wish you would put your times in as if starting from scratch like recipes that call for chicken to be cooked that takes minutes to do i add the time before printing for my recipe cards
4,very nice recipe this soup was really good and filling great leftovers for next day lunch too will be making this again thanks for sharing
4,excellent recipe and directions are easy to follow my only suggestion is to have fun with the recipe and serve pickle relish and ketchup on the side my guestsenjoyed the recipe and laughed made their evening
4,i made this soup for dinner last night based on reviews that stated their husbands do not care for soup but loved this one my husband does not care for soup but i love all soups i thought this soup was really good and would definately eat it again my husband said it was ok and would eat it again as a filler the only change i made was to use pound of hamburger i cant imagine that pound would be enough
4,these taste great but my husband said that he would prefer the corn tortilla over the flour as he found them too soggy
4,i prefer homemade enchilada sauce to storebought so i knew i wanted to try this i felt the sauce was lacking a teensy bit and the amount of flour used seems strange but it all came together nicely i think i might try to add more of the chili powder to the sauce next time though i had enough filling to make more enchiladas too
4,pretty good recipe the only thing is there was too much flour too thick needs more sauce and the tortillas were a little soggy i would subtract some flour add more tomato sauce and cook the tortillas a little before preparing them
4,pthese were great they have a strong banana flavour which we love i used mashed bananas and halved the frosting recipe as suggested by another reviewer the frosting was still very sweet i will make this again and sometimes without the frostingp
4,we enjoyed this recipe but found it to be a little rich next time im using only ounces of cream cheese and im going to try freezing it first so it cuts easier im also going to double the syrup as its delicious thank you for the recipe
4,very good bread pudding but next time i will blend the egg mixture with the cream cheese and only use ounces good enough to try again and again
4,i will make again with revisions creaming cream cheese and a little sugar together and adding it instead of chunks also as another reviewer stated doubling the sauce but with only one cup of sugar it was quick and easy to try but it was a tad bland for my familys taste buds but we will do it again with the above changes
4,i made this for my daughters birthday brunch my family really enjoyed this because of time constraints i didnt make the sauce and served it with syrup but i definitely want to try it with the sauce next time i would say this feeds i used packages of cream cheese but next time i will only use one i thought it was a bit too much also used eggs and it was plenty moist i will make this one again on easter if not sooner
4,we served this on christmas morning and it was a hit next time im only going to use bar of cream cheese freezing it first so it will chunk easier as it was a little too decadent with two im also going to double the sauce as it really added flavor to the mealthanks for a great recipe
4,was a bit hard to tell when done i am a bit ocd about doneness and making sure things are cooked thoughly so mine was a bit over donebut still very good i also halved the recipie and made this for me and my bf on xmas morning well i made it the day before and cooked it on the morning of xmas love that its a make ahead deal the the syrpe that you make with the recipie is very yummy a bit bland as its just sugar and blueberries mostly but very very yummy i would recommend maybe cutting the cream cheese up alot smaller than i did to disperse it a bit more but other than that i loved it and he was sick but tasted it and said it was very good def will be making this again and again especial for xmas morning fantastic breakfast or brunch idea or maybe even dinner
4,delicious recipe i used less eggs and had to bake for longer than the specified time i didnt make the sauce either we just used maple syrup
4,great recipei made this several years ago the topping is deliciousi made this for my boyfriend and we took it to work the next day everyone loved it and raved about it would definitely make again
4,my pie seemed a little eggy what size eggs did you use i also had to bake min longer to bake the center
4,ive been making a pie like this since the s except its called mystery pecan pie and has no caramel in it it is delicious
4,made this awhile back but forgot to rate easy dessert to make and came out looking just like the picture its very good but super rich
4,this was a hit at thanksgiving everyone loved it i poured only about of the carmel on the pie and i wish i hadnt next time ill use the whole jar
4,easy to make yet looks like you spent hours slaving in the kitchen rich tasting yet not too sweet
4,this pie is extremely tasty but a bit too sweet for me my family loved it my only complaint was that it was a bit watery maybe its just me
4,everyone enjoyed the flavor of this pie next time i will make my own crust
4,my pie didnt set upfollowed instructions to a teebut we ate it with a spoongreat flavor
4,delicious easy i am going to try a pet ritz pie shell this next time i did cook the pie a little longer then suggested as i wasnt sure how the center of the pie should be before taking it out any suggestions
4,ive made this several times but have to add much more baking time to get the center cream cheese set also i had to use a deep dish pie crust and still had caramel mixture left overbut everyone loves it so i will keep making adjustments
4,i loved the ease in which this dessert came together i made one for my neighbor and one to share with my teaching colleagues they loved it i expect it to be on a few of their thanksgiving menus i also made the doublepastry pie crust recipe from the website for this recipe
4,very yummy i made this recipe from the cookbook and didnt see these reviews online until after making it so i used the squeezable container of smuckers sundae topping cookbook recipe doesnt specify the topping in a jar turned out with a gooey caramel layer under the pecans on top of the cheesecake instead of at the bottom like the picture shows and like they say will happen if you use the correct product it was still yummy im only giving it four stars though because i wasnt blown away and because of the confusion
4,this recipe was good thought i would try this because of the caramel but it remind me of a pie i make which is a cream cheese pecan pie the recipe was easy to follow i would make it again
4,i found a large can of fresh clams at whole foods in their refrigerated fish section for those that do not have fresh clams at their market and much better then those canned clams you find in the grocery canned meat section if you have a whole foods nearby also being a busy momi had a bag of frozen diced has browns and used those instead of peeling and dicing my potatoesturned out every bit as good and saved me minutes prep time this was a tasty success for a cold winter evening i made homemade bread bowls and hollowed them out to serve the chowder in toast the extra bread you remove as crotons to serve in the soup
4,very good ive been looking for really good recipes that i can use repeatedly and this makes the cut very versatile easy to change up the ingredients with good results
4,this clam chowder was good but not great i didnt find the finished product to be worth the amount of work that went into it it looked simple and it was but there was a fair amount of chopping i served it with good bread and salad and we found that to be quite filling i had some left and froze it well see if it tastes better when i reheat it im not sure i would make this again
4,my husband and i thought it was just okay
4,very good and so easy i didnt have white pepper or thyme which i think would make it better my husband who grew up in the green mountains of vermont loved it the bacon sprinkled on too was a great addition
4,being from new england i love this version of clam chowder no tomato base chowder for me this is pretty similar to what i grew up with except we never had garlic or canned clams it was always fresh littlenecks or quahogs
4,i just made this for dinner tonight i added two cans of cream of chicken soup and an extra clam juice to it i dont like to use flour if i can help it everything else i did exactly to the recipe i liked it and will make it again thanks
4,im confused maybe its my ipad but the youtube doesnt show anything besides the strips of bacon lying in the skillet ostensibly sizzling to the tune of ian posts du da im going to give this a try i just dug razors down here in newport oregon
4,it was decent i think too much sugar for my taste
4,it should be noted that the recipe says simmer covered for to minutes until potatoes are done however in the video it shows that the dish is covered while simmering for to minutes you might want to clarify that
4,i made this recipe yesterday and the only thing i would do different from now on is to cut the crust ingredients in half i thought the crust was too thick
4,i would describe this as a dessert you eat with a fork as opposed to a bar took a lot longer than minutes to cook crust too thick but still very good
4,this is a very yummy way to use up some rhubarb i added some cinnamon and nutmeg into the custard part of the bars and cut the sugar just a tad i also used a whole brick of cream cheese and more like cups of heavy cream for the whipped cream part of the topping and i think next time i will just double the topping part altogether it is so good all in all this recipe is a definite keeper next time i will also up the sugar in the crust just a smidge as that part still needs something more
4,i added a tablespoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of cloves to the rhubarb next time ill add even more very good
4,sounds like a wonderful recipe but can i substitute fresh strawberries i dont have rhubarb on hand and the store is miles away
4,i have found out a few things making this recipe use ice cream topping i used smuckers and not syrup the syrup doesnt set up it needs to cook about minutes longer than the recipe says always delicious and a new favorite
4,this recipe was pretty good i used a pound of ground beef instead of a half pound and i left my potatoes on too high of heat for too long i got a phone call so they went mushy and dissolved other than that it was really good and i would recomend it to anyone who loves cheeseburgers and soup
4,mom and hubby really liked it
4,delicious and quick watch for bags of frozen peeled deveined shrimp to go on sale if youre landlocked like me agree with use of some red pepper flakes for heat but add into the oil to flavor it can use white wine in place of lemon juice or combination of the two add a little bit of the pasta water to make more sauce without adding extra fat
4,my husband loved it a little too much lemon juice though next time i will only do cup instead of the full cup overall very nice
4,this is very good
4,loved the tastehad to make some changes for next timenot enough sauce will ad white wine use less lemon juice will use less bread crumbs thinks just a sprinkle across top to broil and brown is good enough also recipe did not mention pasta amount used in this dish i used a pound for peopleaalthough i tripled the recipei love left overs also stored scampi seperately so that pasta didnot absorb sauce very easy recipe and quick to boot thanksa crowd pleaser served with salad and garlic bread with melted mozzarellajust yummy
4,i omitted the bread crumbs and it was still delicious the lemon juice really brightens the flavor of the dish
4,my year old son loves this delicious dish he likes the honey grilled shrimp better though
4,was good and definately quick and easy turned out a little too salty for our taste would probably cut back on the butter some next time otherwise good flavor and the bread crumbs and cheese make it better than the usual shrimp scampi
4,good kid friendly recipe i agree with the other poster about leaving out the sour cream it did give it a stroganoff flavor i didnt have parsley and basil so i used italian seasoning instead and it turned out just fine
4,i was looking for more flavor in this soup since this recipe was given such high ratings our family rated it as good but average in flavor so i wont be making it again
4,so flavorful i couldnt stop at just one bowl
4,very good recipe not too many ingredients and easy to follow directions i did however make a few changes do to my liking of clam chowders ive had in the past i added a small carrot finely diced instead of cup water i added another bottle of clam juice since i was using fresh clams there was no juice i also cut the bouillon down since i was using the extra juice i also used heavy cream instead of half and half so i didnt need the flour sprinkled black pepper on top after it was cookedit was a hearty thick creamy soup and i will definitely make it again this is the second time ive made it so i knew it needed some tweaking i also let me veggies and clams cook longer before adding the potatoes and broth served with oyster crackersit was so yummy
4,recipe was good next time ill cut the thyme in half and increase the clams over all it was easy to make it was my first clam chowder and i was super pleased looking forward to making this again
4,this was a super great jumping off point for those of us that cant remember the last time weve made clam chowder i made this on a late night craving
4,great authentic tasting chowder i used one cup of chicken stock and omitted the bouillon and water i also found that it needed a little more liquid to thin out so i added more stock until i got the consistency i desired it was delicious will make again
4,this was the first time i made clam chowder and i made this for supper tonight my family and i really liked it i doubled the recipe more than doubled the potatoes and decreased the half and half to cups instead of cups with the recipe doubledthank you for the recipe
4,i substituted leeks mostly the white parts for the onion unsalted chicken broth for the bullion and added salt to taste this is a great recipe thanks for sharing
4,this recipe had good flavors it thickened up quickly to begin with but thinned out a lot after adding the rest of the half and half and the clams i would maybe add less half and half or drain one of the cans of clams next time
4,this chowder had a delicious flavor and i didnt think that it needed any added seasoning i do prefer my chowder a bit thicker and i only used cup of halfandhalf which was the full fat version and i would definitely double the amount of clams used i am particular about the taste of my chowders and usually if there is something about a recipe that i didnt like i wont even bother to remake it with changes this recipe however i will make again with the added clams very tasty
4,made this tonight after seeing the favorable reviews followed recipe as is except cut back on the cups of half amp half after so many said it was too much i ended up using about a cup and a half i thought it was good and easy to make probably would give it a out of a scale of next time i may try what ikenatr suggestedmaking the rue in my dutch oven before adding the liquidsadded notesince my first review above i have tried other recipes that i havent liked as much as this one
4,not only did i roast the bananas but the walnuts as well i also added chocolate chips yummy recipe i will make this one again and again i freeze my buttermilk into ice cube trays so it is always handy
4,after reading the reviews i decided to double the sauce it was very good wouldnt change a thing i did put over fettucine just because my family is not fond of the consistency of angel hair pasta will make again
4,added a couple crab cakes to the breadcrumb and cheese topping lemon was perfect with that addition and will definitely make again
4,quick easy meal can be served over rice or pasta add a salad and dinner is ready my teen daughter prepared when i came home from hospital
4,really good the lemon was a little overwhelming or it would have gotten next time ill use a lighter hand with it
4,the flavors of this dish were excellent next time were going to add tomatoes and artichoke hearts to add a little color and veg
4,uh ohi added cup of breadcrumbs instead of the cup called for in recipe the sauce turned out super think not really sauce exactly it tasted good is there anyway to salvage the sauce
4,this recipe needs about a half cup of chicken broth or white wine to keep it from being too dry otherwise it is very very tasty
4,this was a quicker version of shrimp scampi than my usual but was very tasty i add c white wine to the sauce for additional flavor that we enjoy the crumb topping added a pleasant crunch as another reviewed has said take care not to overcook the shrimp i have also doubled the recipe for company and added lb bay scallops for a seafood scampi that is quite good we enjoy the texture of angel hair pasta with our scampi
4,made this soup yesterday added green chili so now we have the recipe green chile cheeseburger soup was really good
4,pretty good soup but it needs a bit much seasoning such as red pepper flakes amp garlic and some crumbled crispy bacon mixed in would be terrific
4,this was awesome i didnt have the big pan so i did as someone noted and made in x it was very moist and had good banana flavor i would definitely make this again thanks for a great recipe
4,these bars taste great i like to add cup of chopped walnuts or pecans to the bar recipe in order to add extra flavor and some crunch i also prefer a thicker bar so i bake this recipe in a xxinch pan the icing is very good and a perfect addition to these bars
4,just made these today had to use two x square baking pans baked for minutes turned out beautifully think i will cut the frosting recipe in half to save on calories and sweetness next time gets two thumbs up on deliciousness
4,pretty goodi found if you make the banana mix and cover it and let it sit overnight the taste of the bananas just really pops frost the next dayalso it is so much easier to mix frosting if you let the butter and cream cheese sat to room temperture after frosting i stick it back in the fridge to set up just a bittook it to a church function and now have to make a copy for someone almost forgot it turned out better when i made it in a x and baked it for about min compared to the x
4,these bars are really good i have made them two times now within a week the first time i made as writtenexcellent but the frosting was a bit too rich second time i left unfrosted and they are just as good we have been adding a frosting of cream cheese a little confectioners sugar with whipped topping folded in to a few just enough sweet on top
4,delicious
4,i think i overcooked mine a little so ill watch it closer next time
4,made a batch and brought to a school function for others to review and enjoy well liked by both kids and adults a few commented it may be nice to have the addition of toasted nuts or coconut topping also most said it tasted more like cake than a bar everyone enjoyed the frosting thougheven those who normally said they were not banana bread eaters will make again
4,yummy
4,very good i used four medium sized banannas gave it a wonderful taste
4,actually maybe i will make this again i used one pound of ground beef like man suggested and it was a little too beefy otherwise good
4,very nice texture and flavor takes a long long time to cook more than the usual banana bread recipe the crust on the outside of the bread turned out a little thick though i did not burn it will most likely make again and experiment with the baking temperature
4,delicious i need to know how to make the boston clam chowder or do i just add somefew tomatoes carolyn
4,very good chowder poured off most of the bacon drippings saved about tb for sautéing i used oz cans of crown prince whole wild caught clams i also just used the juice from the cans strained the fat free half amp half worked beautifully i used white whole wheat pastry flour which worked well for thickening husband says to rate this chowder at starsi thought stars
4,ive been making this for many years however i used the full fatfull sugar versions of everything except the milk i only keep fat free milk on hand so i will use that also i will dispense with the maraschino cherries although i like them they do add extra sugar nevertheless im glad i encountered this recipe again this will make a great dessert for my husbands upcoming birthday
4,light and delicious the directions were a bit confusing thoughpudding doesnt come in ounce packages that i could find so i used a large instant vanilla pudding mix plus the cooking time for a yellow cake was about minutes not i may have used the wrong cake mix as suggested i used a regular size yellow cake mix because of the x pan i also mixed the crushed pineapple with the pudding and cream cheese then spread it on the finished cake okay i didnt use anything remotely healthy and went with fullfat cream cheese pudding milk and cool whip the end result was fantastic and i will definitely make this again
4,ive made this a few times and everyone that tried it loved it and cant believe its not full of fat
4,made this last night my husband loved it i thought it was a bit too peppery but that is easy to remedy loved how creamy it is will definately make this again
4,this was very good but im not sure what i think about the cream cheesethat part was not quite sweet enough when mixed with only pudding and no additional sugar otherwise great i think it would be good with strawberries instead of pineapple to compliment the cream cheesei used the recipe as a guideline but made my own cake and pudding from scratch and no fatfree or sugarfree stuff i also topped with toasted coconut instead of walnutswe were not patient enough to wait for it to chill so it might be better cold
4,didnt change a thing
4,isnt that called banana nut bread
4,absolutely delicious plus is a light dessert after a big meal
4,this recipe is delicious i made a few substitutions lean ground turkey low sodium black beans lowfat ricotta cheese no refried beans whole wheat tortillas and lowfat cheese i had to cook it a little longer minutes covered and minutes uncovered i like my tortillas crispy
4,this sound amp looks delishi am going to try this
4,this recipe tasted great the flavors really come together and i believe kids would really like it i am only giving it four stars because between them chopping browning and baking this recipe takes at least minutes to prepare
4,good recipe to reduce the amount of fat i used fat free refried beans and nondairy cheese i also used corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas fat free tortillas can also be used to reduce the fat even further
4,i tryed this and it was very good added my home grown green peppers bigger chunks
4,very good i served it with sour cream and thats tops it off to great i changed the original recipe ground turkey breast canned diced tomatoes canned green chiles added mexicorn used la tortilla factory tortillas ff refried beans and ounces vs cheese i baked º for minutes covered then uncovered and baked for another minutes the top got nice and crispy so good and would serve
4,nice comfort food i used diced tomatoes with green chilies bc i couldnt find the mexican ones the sauce was really spicy in the pan but cooled off in the mix of the casserole served with sour cream and lettuce will add jalapenos next time
4,made this for dinner tonight whole family loved it however i made a few changes right off the bat my current changes were i used whole wheat flour tortillas venison burger about pounds two packets of taco seasoning cups oz bags of shredded mexican cheese we also added sour cream and guacamole as a garnishthings i will do differently next time i make it i will use sliced green onions in beef mixture and as a garnish i will use a tub of fresh salsa instead of mexican diced tomatoes and when i do that i will delete the cup water because fresh salsa has way more juice than a can of diced tomatoes and i would definitely break up the top layer of tortillas and spread them evenly cuz those were tough to cut i had to perforate them with a sharp knife to get an even cut even sprinkled with cheese and baked they were not soft enough to cut pieces with the spatulaother than my changes this was an awesome first time recipe for us and we liked it
4,pretty good soup but it needs a bit much seasoning such as red pepper flakes amp garlic and some crumbled crispy bacon mixed in would be terrific
4,very tasty soupbe careful though really really rich and filling my family liked it and i will make it again
4,i made this with corn tortillas you need a few more since theyre smaller my family loved it it even reheated well in the microwave this is going in the easy fast good recipes book
4,im doing this but using lasagna noodles and red enchilada sauce
4,i made this today was very moist tasted great easy to do would make again
4,fallowed direction then added my own twist easier to make own taco seasoning then added pinch of brown sugar and about teaspoon ancho chili spice used ground turkey and corn tortillas flour tortillas end up as mosh for left overs thanks for other comments made me realize its a good go to recipe
4,it was very tasty but hard to cut into portions my husband said hed prefer it if i made the filling and gave him the tortillas and cheese so he could make tacos with it that would solve the cutting problem it is really just a big taco in a dish
4,my kids picked around the beans and the tomatoes essentially leaving tacos i may make this one again i enjoyed the flavor but it was too close to regular tacos to justify the extra time and pans required
4,as written this is just ok to m fairly good but not stars for my taste it is similar to mine except for a x pan i use almost x the beef
4,i made this tonight i left out the refried beans alsothe last two top torilas so only needed didnt need as much cheese as recipe calls for only used cups or less
4,i think this would be great with polenta slices instead of the tortillas
4,this recipe was good i made a few changes for my family we dont care for black beans so i omitted them fast easy amp yummy
4,this a very good recipe i made my own refried beans which is better than the canned my husband loves texmex and mexican food so this will be made again soon i added some shredded lettuce and sour cream on top once it was platted very good
4,i used cans of black beans and omitted the refried beans i exchanged corn tortillas for flour and increased the cheese to cups instead of a oz can of tomatoes try using two cans oz each of rotel tomatoes
4,this was very good my family thought it was delicious i could not find a ozcake mix so i bought the regular size i also used no fat free products by using the regular size cake mix i thought there was too much cake next time i will measure out the ounces other than that i am definately making again
4,easy to make and was a hit with my family especially my grandson
4,great and light recipe i did add vanilla to the cake mix and the pudding and also added orange flavoring to the pineapple my family loved it
4,i have a similar recipe using angel food cake mix and a oz can of unsweetened crushed pineapple mixed together and baked in a x pan then i add the toppings this would be a trans fat free cake recipe
4,i used the cheesecake pudding replaced all sugar free ing added a touch of pineapple kula was great thank you and your momma
4,this us a definite omg tastes sinful and a lot less fat content
4,this recipe is a star sorry
4,i have made this recipe many times but i add a can of mandrin oranges in the cake mix for a bit more flavor
4,this is for labounty a friend of mine makes a frosting out of a large tub of whipped topping and a package of any flavor pudding mixed together the french vanilla is very goodyou can do the low fatsugar free version
4,this is my first try at pumpkin bread i looked over the reviews before starting and im glad i took the advice of using the whole can of pumpkin and omitting the water it came out perfect i used a glass bread pan and it took minutes just like the recipe stated i forgot to add walnuts i think it would be yummy with some spreadable cream cheese
4,im disappointed i made loaves today and neither of them was cooked through to the bottom even though i left them in for longer than minutes and its not my oven
4,before i bake thiswhat size can of pumpkin
4,love pumpkin bread in the fall used choc chips instead of raisins
4,good flavor nice spice mine came out overly sweet though for my taste and a bit heavy not light and airy i had dried cranberries so i used those next time i will try with fresh
4,i made these into mini loaves i used cinnamon chips and less sugar instead of raisins and walnuts very easy to make
4,it was good particularly when i added some mini chocolate chips
4,very delicious and moist i cut the sugar down to cup and used chocolate chips instead of raisins
4,easy simple recipe moist and delicious i used cup less sugarperfect sweetness
4,nice
4,the flavor was very very good but i over cooked it hours in my slow cooker was to long would have been very yummy with mashed potatoes
4,it was good but very salty wont make it this way again because of the sodium content not because of the flavor
4,very good roast but mine was very salty i dont know which of the powdered mixes made it so salty but other then that is was very flavorful i think the brown gravy mix may have been the culprit
4,served this to guests and everyone raved about it i served it with boiled red potatoes and a saladenough saida great complete meal
4,wonderful recipe
4,very good i made loaves to use the whole can of pumpkin i subbed applesauce for the oil
4,good recipe i did go with the extra pumpkin and left out the water iffy about the raisins but went with them tasty addition
4,i use diced ham i purchase in the package instead of bacon the bacon was too greasy for me i also add spinach andor green pepper
4,pthis was deliciousp
4,i have made this many times i have added extra seasoning because the amounts listed werent enough for me also i have subbed the lemon juice for dry white wine a couple of times because i had no lemons very good either way
4,this was pretty simple pretty straightforwards i liked the spices but wanted more on top of my fish so next time ill increase that i put as many capers as i wanted on top so that part was delicious i felt like there was a tad too much butter but thats probably personal preference overall a solid tilapia recipe that ill probably try again with some tweaks
4,i also added a few dashes of old bay this was very good i will be making it again
4,iv been fishing for a long time around yrs so just a tip on how to make your fish tast better turn the fillets over flat side up and you will see a dark line running from end to end this is the blood line it makes the fish taste strong so remove it by slicing it away then turn it back over and make sure its gone there might be a little left on the bottom edge iv shown friends this and every one has thanked me as they liked the taste of there fish better
4,if you are trying to eat healthier dont use tilapia try another mild white fish i used salt water trout filets was very good
4,i left off the capers and the oregano since this was a first for two young boys they ate it with no complaints and it was an easy and tasty dish for adults too use a glass baking dish since the lemon juice can scar a metal dish
4,so easy and really good i left off the capers bc we dont like them really good and easy week night meal
4,very easy quick and delicious i will make this again
4,yummy and easy i think it needs more salt for next time stayed nice and moist
4,great recipe i also altered it as recommended by other users i only used c sugar as my bananas were really ripe i used three bananas and added tsp of cinnamon and used c of coconut oil instead my bread was done after min so keep your eye on it as it does not take over an hour to bake next time i might add baking powder as mine didnt come out as high and fluffy as i would have liked it
4,great recipe i also altered it as recommended by other users i only used c sugar as my bananas were really ripe i used three bananas and added tsp of cinnamon and used c of coconut oil my bread was done after min so keep your eye on it as it does not take over an hour to bake next time i might add baking powder as mine didnt come out as high and fluffy as i would have liked it
4,this is a quick and simple way to prepare fish i enjoyed the fresh lemon juice and the salty capers
4,this was very good might add cup of beef broth low sodium next time instead of water to give it a little more beef flavor also added carrots amp potatoes on top and made gravy with left over juices for a complete meal
4,this was really flavorful and quick to prepare and put in crockpot
4,the finish product was delicious but i only used half of the packages i served it with mashed potatoes and corn fritters
4,it is very flavorful but also very salty i like things a little salty and this was too salty for me
4,very flavorful i use wine and cup of beef broth in place of the wateri have also used onion soup mix instead of the brown gravy mix
4,move over lipton onion soup mix recipe
4,flavorful
4,this was so easy and tasted pretty good although it seemed a little too salty i too put potatoes carrots and some onion on the bottom
4,i just made this for sunday dinner it was really good i put my roast in the oven on degrees for about to hoursi came out great i removed the roast the last hours sliced it added some cornstarch to the gravy prior to serving with some homemade mashed potatoes this is delicious i would definitely make this again
4,loved the flavor but it was toooooo salty
4,i made this yesterday to take to work todayi really enjoyed making this as it was as many have said very easy one thing i didntdo was follow the recipe to a t when i read the ingredients it sounded way too sweet it was going to have a cloying affect reading all the reviews i found others thought so too after they had made it decided to cut the powdered sugar in half didnt add powdered sugar to the pudding either also a change i made was to cut some of the sweetness by adding some creme fresh to the cream cheese another thing i did was melted the butter and i broke up the cookies more fine like a pie crust i knew if i added the melted butter to the cookie crumbs id be able to pat it better into the bottom of my container i put it in the refrigerator overnight because i plan on serving this to my coworkers for the next few days also omitted putting the cookie chunks andor the mini peanut butter cups on top because i didnt know how well it would travel on a plane and the top treats would just get squashed plus seemed like overkillmy husband was able to just have one bite last night and a small bite at that because his stomach was on fire from mexican restaurant we went to for dinner he did say this was very good i actually think ill make this several more times i wish i wouldve known about it last weekend at our yr olds birthday party but i didnt all in all i think this is a hitdinged a point because of original recipe being too sweet for our taste as written plus additionsampsubtractionspsupdate july stmade it again yesterday for a neighbor who is having a st time swimpool filling up party tonight i use the oz pudding mix because i want to make it a large dessert for this us celebration weekend party i crushed chocolate colored rock candy on top for color from winco bulk dept i wont be here for the party tonight but hope it will be enjoyed ask if you care to know how i changed this recipe to suit our tastes happy to oblige
4,too rich and it got soggy fast wont make again
4,amazing tasting i wouldnt have put it in the simple section though it took my two hours and too many dirty dishes
4,peanut butter amp chocolate lovers will adore this recipe my company raved about it amp it was easy to assemble
4,the results are fabulous but i disagree with the submitter that its a cinch to whip up because theres no baking involved bowls two washes of the beaters letting things set up etc i could have whipped up a fantastic batch of brownies which are baked in about the same amount of time or less actually just because you dont have to bake it doesnt mean its a cinch
4,i have not made this yet but wanted to know if you use chocolate cream cookies or oreos i want to try to make it for a dinner soon amp was just wondering what others use thanks for the recipe it sounds amp looks so yummy
4,this is a very tasty recipe i agree with the previous poster make sure you use the amount of meat or it will be salty there has been times where i omitted the italian dressing just using the gravy mix and the ranch dressing is still very flavorful
4,looking very delicious
4,very good even though i didnt reread how to make this i just tossed everything in with the butter dah cooked for minutes perfect
4,i eliminated the capers as i dont like them and i forgot to add the butter after melting it in the microwave but it still turned out great it was very light the bonus was how easy this is to pull together for a meal
4,love it also good with cod will try it this summer with lake perch and walleye
4,my husband didnt care for tilapia untill i tried this recipe now he raves about it i did use a little more lemon juice just because i was not too exact measuring it was tasty the capers really brought it to life
4,since tilipia is an economical and mild fish im always looking to new ways to prepare it this is very quick and delicious the sauce also works well for chicken this is a winner
4,fish is not my favorite thing but since we need to have it a couple times a week this is one recipe i can use to make it okay enough to eat it for people that arent fish eaters use milder flavored fish such as cod tilapia mahimahi
4,this was okay nothing special but i dont think i used enough lemon also think it might be better with a thicker fish thanks for sharing
4,this was my first attempt at making fish i dont eat fish often but am trying to start eating more of it i chose this recipe because of ease of preparation and its use of capers i love them it really was a very easy preparation the result was great the combination of lemon with the spices was very freshtasting and the paprika gave it just enough of a smoky flavor i will definitely be making this again
4,the actual cake was delicious amp moist the icing was just too buttery tasting for me with the sticks however the spreading consistency was perfect i will use my own chocolate buttercream frosting next time i placed chocolate covered strawberries around the top and on the sides it was a big hit with the family
4,this is my go to banana bread recipe made the following changes reduced sugar to cup sugar added cup of brown sugar tea of baking powder used melted coconut oil for canola oil my bread only took minutes to bake at due to nut allergies l dont add nuts
4,when i took it out of the oven i wasnt too excited with how dark the bread was and the fact that it caved in the center some looking at the picture i see that one caved in the center some as well i did add more flour because of our altitude perhaps i needed to add a little more it is a very sweet bread and not the usual banana bread flavor that i prefer but my husband was very happy with it he commented several times that it was good bread i do like how moist it is the main thing to note is its a sweet bread and despite the darkness of it when it comes from the oven and tastes fine and is moist
4,when i have to tweak a recipe i automatically take a star away with that being said this recipe was good and we enjoyed it but it does need the additional brown sugar for me i added a fourth of a cup and everyone loved it i will make it again
4,i used plain greek yogurt instead of sour creamadds protein for same taste i also used less sugar all the way around and plain chopped baking walnuts instead of pecans delicious
4,delicious easy to make healthier use low fat cream cheese and non fat plain yogurt i used splenda and only of cup and no brown sugar on top also dry roasted almonds instead of sugared nuts
4,easy to make and a refreshing new way to eat grapes
4,a staff favourite at our parties it is always requested thanks for sharing the recipe
4,really nice cake you have really done a nice job as you have shared the best things for me even this recipes can be made in busy time also its really special for me thanks for sharing it here on this site
4,i gave it stars because my son really liked it but my daughter and i thought it was just okay
4,my family loves this but it never seems to be done in minutes my oven is set at what am i dining wrong any suggestions
4,not giving it stars because the frosting is just too much for this cake too sweet and trust me i love chocolate i put this in a bundt pan and drizzed the ganache over the top used the berries as a side garnise as well no need for the other frosting was amazing without and much simpler
4,this cake was delicious my whole family loved it it was easy and quick enough
4,love this recipe
4,the cake was tasty did not taste like a box mix the frosting was soft easy to spread would need chilling on a summer day
4,this cake was delicious and everybody loved it but im not sure what im doing wrong with the frosting it comes out too soft how many sticks of butter should i be using
4,i made it with raspberries and it was amazing much better than the strawberries
4,i love the idea of this cake and it is really beautiful i generally dont like using boxed cake mixes though so when ive made this again i use a fromscratch recipe i also use my own chocolate buttercream recipe this one always seems a bit grainy to me
4,took about hours from start to finish to make this cake i made it for a fundraiser bake sale it looked amazing unfortunately it only made at the bake sale
4,turned out well
4,ok so this may sound like a dumb question but im making this now and as im mixing it it is extremely thick do i add the water and oil called for on the box of the cake mix plus whats in the receipe here or just what is called for in the receipe listed here or is the thickness normal didnt see anyone else comment about it so
4,ok so just made this cake have not tried it yet but tried the frosting and i think it is way buttery next time i make it i might just use store bought or find a differnt frostingit is very easy to make
4,ive made this cake times in a month its awesome everyone loves it
4,my husband couldnt stop raving about this dish i used fresh crab but everything else was the same it was work intensive but will make again for a special occasion or large gathering
4,just finished eating my first attempt at this recipe and it was great did make a couple of changesadded chopped onions and one clove of minced garlic didnt have clam juice so used of clamato juice and increased chicken broth to cup we are looking forward to leftover tomorrow
4,agree with most of the reviews definitely an excellent recipe used amp instead of cream still very rich and creamy also used the clam juice from a can of chopped clams and used the clams instead of the crabmeat added some minced garlic extra green onion and extra parmesan cheese looking forward to the leftovers
4,this is a well put together recipe i followed it to the letter and i did find the sauce a bit too pasty maybe less flour next time and bland it needs more seasoning only salt and pepper was called for in the recipe but i would definitely experiment with other spices as well and up the green onions from to like
4,this is absolutely delicious however no way does it serve we had for dinner and have enough for one person to have leftovers it is not as high as it shows in the picture three layers is just not that high i didnt add the fake crab and dont think it was missed i will definitely make it again and pass on the recipe
4,i enjoy this recipe as a way to use my grapes if they arent getting eaten
4,just got done making this cake with my niece easy to follow only used cups butter in the frosting really rich
4,love this cake i used raspberries and blackberries instead of strawberries it was great
4,my sister made this cake for christmas eve dinner we all loved it i will definitely make it for myself in the very near future
4,these were yummy and easy to make i love the almondcherry flavor combination so liked that the almond extract was in the bars as well as the glaze i also sprinkled some blanched almonds over the top of the bars after glazing for extra flavor and texture and it looked really pretty too these bars were a bit thinner than i prefer so next time i will bake them in a smaller pan
4,it was a really good cake the only problem i had was with the frosting so if i make it again i wouldnt use this frostingother wise good cake
4,part if you bake them a bit longer than recommended the crust holds up better in bar form i often bake them mins at home never had a burnt crust the convection ovens at the bakery were definitely faster if they come out with softer crust just cut into smaller bite size pieces or eat with fork the batter is very thick fist time i made i i though i did something wrong you can easily alter the amount of sugar to your liking change up the filings extracts and nuts or other addins as you choose its pretty forgiving its kinda bad hard to mess up this recipe underbaking is usually the biggest issue as is not using enough filling at a bakery you cant skimp on fillings customers dont like that if you do add the drizzle on top it will make the bars a bit wet it the sit out all day bakery tip for dryer drizzle use less milk it should be very thick as in not a drizzle at all but kinda toothpaste like then heat in microwave no more than seconds at a time gets super hot very fast once hot drizzle quickly as it will hardenget crusty very quickly once it drys on the bars it wont make them overly soft works great and you can remix remaining crusted drizzle with few drops of liquid and reheat if it gets too difficult to work with i burned myself a few times with the hot mix so be careful not to overheat it
4,made this cake twice first time we fond too sweet too much sugar second time wait better as i put just i cup of sugar did put a bet of coconut essence to give an extra taste it is a very easy cake to make and very good did not have butter milk so i put yogurt a slice of it is now my husband favorite breakfast
4,very good but too sweet next time ill omit the icing
4,i made this with ham and green chilis so my husband could grab a scoop and heat it up quick before heading off to work in the mornings he loved it and thought the recipe deserved and a half stars he said he left the half star off because there might be a little too much cheese will try with bacon and less cheese next time
4,i rated this a because it tasted ok however it is missing garlic i dont feel this is a lasagna but a seafood alfredo using lasagna noodles it is seafood with an alfredo sauce except for the missing garlic and lasagna noodles
4,i will agree with other comentors it is a very tasty dish but a little bit of old bay added a great deal to the flavor a little dash of lime enhanced it as welland next time i will add some garlic it just seemed to be missing something in its purist form be prepared because this recipe makes a lot of lasagna and it is very fattening and high in cholesterol i cut it in half and still had a lot of leftovers also i think you would be hard pressed to prepare this in minutes plan on at least an hour lastly get your credit card or checkbook out because it is not an inexpensive meal to make once a year on special occasions or if we are having company and want to impress i still liked it though
4,excellent well worth the cost of the seafood
4,after reading some comments and having previous experience with alfredo sauce i added some lemon juice a touch of old bay seasoning garlic and used a shallot instead of the green onion and the sauce was absolutely delicious with those modifications
4,next time will skip the flour i read all the reviews before trying this for the first time i agree with the review about the flour quantity i cut it to cup of flour but still the sauce became like spackle i had to add an additional quarts of liquid to make the sauce creamy next time i will try just an alfredo sauce with butter parmesan and cream and maybe some white wine also i added old bay to the seafood liquid and subbed shallots and garlic for the green onion overall it was delicious
4,the original recipe published in the febmarch tofh magazine calls for only cup flour i believe there is a typo in this online version because cup worked well
4,oh my my my this was soooooo good all i changed was i used regular onions and spenich h and it was so good i will make this again sooner than later
4,being a creole girl from new orleans la i simple love seafood i tried this dish but i used real lump crab meat added the holy trinity onion bell pepper and celery added white cooking wine to the sauce and added a dash of old bay seasoning chile my husband still licking his fingers
4,its is a very good recipe however i find using too much real crab meat will give it an overwhelming taste thats most likely why they suggest imitation crab meat
4,i made this recipe a few times for guest everyone loves it very rich but well worth it
4,i made this as the recipe directed except i prepared my bacon on a sheet pan in the oven and then added it along with drippings to the skillet with onion and it was delicious the first batch went to the kids at church so my own family requested a batch for home simple to prepare hearty and satisfying
4,yummy id make it again
4,would give this stars had i not altered the recipe based on some of the reviews i read i cut the amount of sugar in half which didnt seem to make a difference and only used can of pie filling it seemed like enough i used raspberry but after baking i regretted that decision will definitely make again and use the full cans other than that these were a hit at the wisconsin badger football party i took them to
4,the taste was good but i had trouble getting them completely cooked i baked for minutes until the top was golden brown when i went to cut them the lower crust was not cooked the whole way through i had to put them back in the oven for minutes more next time i will try baking the bottom crust for maybe minutes before putting the cherries on similar to how lemon squares are baked
4,made these today using stevia baking blend and egg substitute made a halfrecipebaked for minutes but probably shouldcould have left them in for another will do that next timedid not make the frosting drizzle and dont need to these have a really nice flavor we wouldnt want it to be too sweet
4,my mom made these and we called them valentine squares very good
4,great feeds a crowd wonderful flavor with hint of almond
4,kind of gooey but really good and super easy to make my family loves em i cut the recipe in the full recipe makes a ginormous amount but almost all of ours from the recipe are eaten already also made mine with only vanilla extract as im allergic to the almond still came out very good
4,easy to make and sweet i left off the icing and didnt miss it had to bake the bars longer as many other reviewers suggested tasty but quite plain otherwise it would get stars
4,i had to bake at least to minutes to get some browning on the top this did not overbake them on the bottom if i make again i will omit the almond flavoring in the icingi took them to work and the reviews were that they were great
4,i was tempted to use my banana bread recipe to make muffins but i saw another reviewer did just that and was unhappy with the result these were good not quite what i was hoping for i would call them onenote but they are really twonote sugar and banana i think the thing that is missing is brown sugar maybe a mix of brown and white would give these a little more depth
4,would have been stars but there was no spice luckily i realized this before putting into cupcake holders added tsp of cinnamon and tsp of nutmeg perfect these were now grandkids ready
4,i read the commnents before making this so used cups of sugar i do have a sweet tooth and added about cup chopped walnuts this is an easy and delicious recipe
4,this is a basic banana muffin recipe but very easy and very good
4,simple and delicious its a little dense but the flavor is on point
4,light and fluffy i added nutmeg and cinnamonand some coconut flakes a pinch of garam masala is nice in the top good basic easy recipe
4,these were easy to mak and very good
4,making this again tonight i thought it was good not amazing but good my bf on the other hand really really liked it guess it depends on what kind of taste you have
4,i know from watching emeril that jambalya normally uses andouille sausage but here in rural western pa we just dont have access to it this is the third time weve made this recipe this time we doubled the chicken shrimp tomatoes and seasonings my family is giving the altered recipe a solid out of
4,wonderfully easy and flavorful
4,very good but mine came out a little soupier than i expected the leftovers thickened up and were perfect i served it over brown rice next time i will use large or jumbo shrimp the medium shrived up too much
4,delishus i loved it but i didnt add in peppers or anything spicy
4,this was not spicy at all but very flavorful i cooked it longer and used pound of shrimp
4,definitely will make again followed recipe with exception of adding hot pepper flakes instead of cayenne really liked the hint of smoked flavor off the sausages
4,excellent flavor and a huge plus for being a onepotfixit forget it type of meal
4,great so simple we usually leave out the shrimp just to save a trip to the grocery store very yummy
4,i enjoyed this casserole and served it for easter breakfast at my house we really liked the combination of the cheddar and swiss cheeses i did add some seasoned salt and pepper to taste as i thought it needed some seasoning
4,added green chilis and chopped red pepper it turned out really good
4,very good i added green chilis as well and it was awesomei think the negative people are real downers and takes away from the fun of this site please everyonebe positive
4,would prefer that people not preach their own opinions that refer to ingredients all can read the recipe and understand and decide if its to their liking
4,this should come with an exercise plan as i made this last night and i thought it turned out real good so much so that ive eaten more than my fair share anyway it is sweet and i love sweets next time i will cut the sugar though maybe cups not also the cooking time is closer to minutes i will try this again with peaches yum
4,my kids love macaroni and cheese with velveeta and they like this one its easy to make and a great side dish i wouldve liked a little crunch on top or something to contrast the creaminess
4,it was a very deliciooous recipe alot better than i thought it would be
4,this was a very nice mac
4,ive made this one i prefer to mix the cheddar with the sauce and melt it that way as others have said adding extra milk isnt a bad idea also i divide this recipe in half because im only cooking for two people i stumbled across another recipe which is very similar to this one it is seasoned with teaspoon onion powder and teaspoon garlic powder my husband likes it this way because he does not care for bland food also we use sharp cheddar or as we call it in canada old or even extra old cheddar
4,a very nice recipe for mac amp cheese it was a little milder than l really like i added slices of chopped bacon and some symbol im sure the leftovers will be wonderful
4,very good flavor and easy
4,really enjoyed this recipe prepared this on the stovetop which i prefer left out the celery and green peppers which i dont care for also did not add any extra salt turned out very well
4,this was tasty but the next time i make this i will not use so much chicken and use more shrimp ill also cut down on the hot sauce everyone thought it was good and the of us voted to do it again
4,love the flavor i didnt have the time to cook in the slow cooker it was quick and easy in my ninja foodie using the pressure cooker feature
4,my family loves it
4,calm down deddmen youll get your pressure up there are all kinds of tastes all types of cooks this is a good crockpot gumbolike dish works great for weeknights maybe sometime we can go down to louisiana and enjoy real jambalaya this is fine for what it is
4,pretty good
4,overall this was good it was a bit overcooked when i checked it at hours it was my first time using a slow cooker though so that could be my fault i might make it again but it gave my husband heartburn last time
4,used turkey sausage and omitted the shrimp excellent
4,nice creamy recipe makes a lot of sauce i increased the amount of pasta
4,this is a quick and easy homemade mac n cheese recipe not one id make for company nothing really special but perfect when i want a quick mac n cheese fix
4,very good with a little tweaking i added a cup of half and half to the cheese sauce and that gave it just the right consistency i gently stirred the cheddar into the finished sauce off heat until melted instead of tossing it with the pasta and that worked out fine i found it was easier to mix the sauce and the pasta together in a large bowl before transferring to baking dish x pan worked fine i also sprinkled a liberal helping of shredded cheddar cheese over the top prior to baking
4,this recipe is fairly easy to make and tastes really good i will be making it again
4,ive been looking for a great macaroni n cheese recipe for very long this one is the best yet i added extra cheese and used fat free milk definitely making it again
4,next time i will use a little more macaroni the cheese sauce was great but there was a little too much
4,it was a bit mushy to me but good i would cook the macaroni less than package directions in the future
4,sweet and moist i will be making this again
4,super rich amp creamy very fullfilling dish used cp cheddar amp cp swiss because thats what we had on hand amp it was delicious we will definetly be making this dish again
4,excellent thanks for sharing my girlfriend liked it and shes pretty finicky great big ole spoon of coolwhip was the only improvement here thanks again
4,very good probably the best crisp we have had it was even better when i added chopped almonds to the top layer of the crumbly stuff next time ill use more cups of apples and cup white sugar in the syrup instead of cup it was on the cusp of being too sweet we didnt have ice or whipped cream so this rating is just the crisp
4,i made this as recipe is and it tastes good but i didnt like that the bottom layer was a little soggy so next time i make this dish i may change the layers to apples on bottom amp crust on top and see if i like that better good recipe though would make again thanks
4,ok
4,sounds good
4,while this recipe was good i found it to be a little too sweet i will make it again but cut back a bit on the sugar maybe its because i used honeycrisp apples my guests raved about it
4,should be called best ever apple crisp
4,amazing this recipe was so delicious the only change i think ill make is to add less sugar and a little more cinnamon otherwise delicious
4,i made this as a sweet potato apple mix with a cup mix that was slightly heavier on the apple sidei only made a half of the crust sprinkling it over just the top of the casserole it was wonder addition to our meal
4,ok easy to make not a strong flavor bacon was a nice change from sausage but maybe could use some vegetable
4,good easygood staple for a morning brunch
4,very good i will make again i backed off on the flour and add a little more milk broiled for min after minutes
4,yummy thanks the family enjoyed this very much
4,finally a homemade mac n cheese thats creamy and not dry
4,my favorite macaroni and cheese recipe
4,for homemade mac n cheese this is the best ive tried definitely not dry i agree with the other posters who said the sauce was thick and pasty there was also too much of it for the amount of pasta next time ill use a whole oz package of macaroni cups uncooked and alter the flour and milk as suggested by others to get a thinner sauce
4,cookies were divineps if you dont follow the recipe you cannot exactly blame toh just a thought use it dont use it
4,i am trying to find a new favorite chewy oatmeal cookie this one is pretty good i was curious about the affect of the instant vanilla pudding the cookies seem pretty sweet i will probably try them again by the recipe and see if they are the same i didnt add the nuts and i thought my dough was a little dry but the chewy factor is there they dont flatten much so i kind of pushed them down when they came out of the oven its a keeper for sure
4,this was my first time making apple crisp and i thought it was very good after reading the reviews with some saying it was too sweet i only used cup of granulated sugar and it came out perfect i would use this recipe again
4,per the reviews i cut my sugar to c brown and c white and it was plenty sweet for us i couldnt even fathom c of sugar otherwise it would be a star
4,this was really good but also very sweet we really enjoyed it but like other reviews i will cut back on the sugar next time i will be making it again
4,this was good and a nice change but i felt it needed a bit more flavor for my tastes i liked that it used potatoes instread of bread i did add ground pepper but felt it still needed something else i will try it again but next time will try some of the other suggestions like pepper jack cheese instead of swisss andor southwest potatoes instead of plain potatoes andor the addition of sautéed peppers and garlic this is just a personal preference for something with a little more kick
4,this was good except it was hard getting the bottom crust out when cutting and serving the next time i make this i will cut the topping in half and only put in on the top of the apples i will also cut down on the sugars as someone else did
4,it was way too sweet i could taste the brown sugar may try again but will cut down on both the white and brown sugars
4,i thought this recipe was too sweet also and a little dry i cut down on the white sugar only used a rd cup and i added a few more apples to add a little more liquid
4,these cookies were really good i had only half of the amount of chocolate chips so usedbutterscotch chips with the chocolate chips yummyjust couldnt stay out of the cookie jar
4,yum
4,burnt the first three dozen the cookied didnt spread as they baked so i ended up with burnt little balls flattened out the last batch a bit and they baked perfectly
4,the vanilla pudding mix keeps these little fellas so moist i used more brown sugar then regular sugar and raisins instead of chocolate chips i cant wait to try different pudding in these
4,just made these using a couple of the other reviewers suggestions i used chocolate fudge pudding and whole wheat flour my husband loved them i felt they were a bit on the dry side though tasty the dryness could be the result of using whole wheat flouri will try the recipe again with all purpose flour to see if that was why they were so dry
4,good but a little dry
4,a coworker of mine is allergic to chocolate and nuts so i made them with butterscotch chips they seemed to be a good pair tasting with the vanilla pudding
4,very easy to make and they were quite a hit
4,i made these last night for v day they look great and the one i ate was delicious i am glad the weather is cool as i am sure they have a low melting point the piping bag suggestion for the filling was so helpful i wonder if that would work with the chocolate also
4,way too much salt i should have followed my instinct and added only t instead they were good aside from that
4,great family friendly recipe easy to make on a week night will definitely make this again
4,we really liked this dish i didnt even serve anything else with it because it is a complete meal in itself until this recipe i thought all shepherds pie dishes were baked in the oven pretty easy to make i even used venison ground beef instead of regular ground beef
4,my kids like this better than reg red bean chili
4,im not really a big fan of apple pie or apple crisp but since its one of my dads favorite desserts i made it for him and i decided to try some of it myself with a little vanilla ice cream on the side it was delicious my whole family loved iti will definitely make it again
4,this was good but too sweet i will cut down on the sugar in the syrup also i baked an extra min and the fuji apples were still a little hard
4,i made this for dinner amp it was yummy the whole family loved it especially my year old i used bacon grease that i already had to saute the onions amp carrots but i had run out of bacon so i didnt have any in the soup i also didnt have cheddar cheese so i used colby cheese and i had to use bouillon cubes instead of the granules
4,i tried the receipt because is was an award winner and it was my first time making apple crisp however i have tried a coworkers apple crisp and it was one of the best i will make this receipe again because it was easy to follow instructions the con overpowered with sugar
4,love this make it for work all the time because it works for those needing gluten free always takes longer to cook then this says though
4,it was easy and delicious but too sweet for me how could i make it less sweet i think it was the syrup
4,i made this recipe and really enjoyed it
4,this was good i halved the recipe carefully staying within the correct amount of ingredients there was not enough liquid in proportion to ham and veggies this soup was tremendously filling must be the cheese
4,i made this exactly as the recipe reads it is good but rich and a little heavy it was good as leftovers not sure i will make this very often but will keep just in case need some comfort food on a cold day
4,i have made this many times now and i am pretty happy with the recipe one thing i did differently was cooking the cubed potatoes in the microwave with some water for a few minutes before adding them as directed i also have not added three cups of cheese probably just one cup or less also one time i used creamed corn in place of whole kernel corn for a thicker soup and most of the time i do not bother with the bacon but use c of butter to saute the onions
4,i would definitely make this again i thought it came out a little thick and my boyfriend wanted more bacon but those were the only complaints
4,i thought this soup turned out great i didnt like the idea of thickening before the potatoes were added so i mixed the flour with the shredded cheese and added it then also added more milk based on other reviews that said soup was too thick result was great soup and it reheats really well the next day too
4,hello fellow cooks we love this recipehave been making it since i do have a question the first time i made this it was perfect ever since after i add the cheddar cheese at the end it all separates and curdles i have added it when the soup is hot and when it has cooled still the same problem what am i doing wrong it tastes just as delicious as the first time when it turned out perfectly but looks very unappetizing i tell my kidsjust eat it with your eyes closed lolany suggestions would be so appreciated after cooking for years this is frustrating thank you
4,hello fellow cooks we love this recipehave been making it since i do have a question i hope someone can help me with the first time i made this it turned out perfectly i have made this many times since but ever since then when i add the cheese at the end it all curdles and separates i have tried adding it when the soup is hot and when it has cooled somewhat still the same result it is still delicious but looks unappetizing i tell my kidsnow grownjust eat it with your eyes closed lol what am i doing wrong after cooking for years it is rather frustrating any suggestions would be so appreciated happy cooking
4,this was good but can use improving i used eggs didnt have swiss cheese so used some sour cream added salt and it still needed some when i served it very good idea and you can definitely play with the recipe add ingredients that you like
4,tasty and easy to create but somewhat bland i will definitely make it again adding green amp red peppers perhaps black olives my son added salsa as a topping saying it was perfect
4,this is a great casserole for breakfast or any other meal it lends itself to being very adaptable i used pepperjack and a little less cheese also i have tried it with spicy italian sausage and another time with diced polish kielbasa always rave reviews from the peanut gallery
4,this recipe is tasty and easy to make i gave it stars as it could be considered a little bland next time im going to try pepperjack instead of swissall in all i liked it and would not hesitate to make this dish again thanks for the recipe
4,very good and makes a lot love it with any kind of bbq
4,good soup for fall and winter served with biscuits or cornbread great way to use up holiday ham
4,lovely but i substituted ham with chicken
4,used ham instead of bacon its a keeper
4,i thought this was a great recipe i just added a bay leaf thyme and garlic powder to add more flavor i also added more chicken granules to it i did double the recipe as well turned out great
4,i really liked jim and austin soso ashley big no
4,pretty good weeknight dinner recipe and easy all the kids really liked it i didnt mix the bacon in the whole pot because i figured the kids wouldnt eat it like that so just crumbled in mine and my husbands separately good either way
4,very good
4,we really enjoyed this recipe however it is very high in sodium will probably make it again but not on a regular basis
4,my husband really liked this used sasuage amp added a dash of cayenne pepper will try pepper jack next time we like kick
4,very decent basic recipe for cottage pie shepherds pie has to have lamb or mutton nice for meal when you dont want oven on edit because cindy it is cottage pie call it what it is it is still a good recipefor not turning on the oven you are being ridiculous
4,made exactly as written and it was good i would add seasoning next time the reheated leftovers were even better the next day will make again and think garlic mashed potatoes would be great thanks
4,this was pretty good i just used mixed vegetables this recipe is very similar to another one of our favorite taste of home recipes stovetop goulash
4,i made this the night before thanksgiving day i when i was plenty tired and had had enough dishes to wash during the day i was so glad it could be served in the same skillet used to cook it in and not have to transfer to the oven like other shepherds pies i always use yukon gold potatoes to make mashed potatoes withit really ratchets up the flavor i do think as another reviewer stated that the meatveggie mixture needed some salt added before the potatoes were spread on top update i am scheduled for foot surgery soon and cannot stand for long periods of time so i made this even quicker for the sauce i used campbells beefy mushroom soup with some sour cream added and for the potatoes i made very thick instant ones with some of the sour cream added i received no complaints from menthey loved it
4,this is a good base to start from i use broth in place of water in any meat based recipe have used beef or mushroom in similar recipes i dont like adding flavouring cubes granules or liquids if they contain msg and other chemicals i check for id rather get flavour from natural sources so my allergies dont act up plus its healthier i have used corn and peas also mixed frozen veggies and peas and carrots whatever i have on hand or am in the mood for i have been known to make the meat and veggie mixture in multiples of the amount in this recipe in a dutch oven so i can freeze some for later use have also added mushrooms fresh preferably or canned i always grind a generous amount of pepper into the base always taking samples for tasting before calling it complete the same with salt which i go easy on the sour cream is a nice twist and i have also used cream cheese in the base sooooo many possibilities thanks for sharing
4,good base recipe next time i will add seasoning needed salt pepper thyme and bay leaf the sour cream made it very creamy next time i will stick with just the beef broth and put some sour cream in the potato i did add celery and carrots
4,i did a few things differently first i didnt put all of the veggies in because it looked like way too much i also didnt put in as much onion and instead added some chopped celery because others stated it was a bit lacking in flavor i added some parsley basil and steak rub seasoning i also used storebought mashed potatoesat the end i stuck it all in a dish and put it in the oven at deg for about minutes next time i will also broil it for a couple minutes too like others suggestedone thing i did notice was a distinct sweetness to it i think it was a combination of the ketchup and the large amount of corn next time i will cut down on the corn and add in a different veggie maybe broccoli while the sour cream made the sauce taste good i didnt really get a strong sour cream flavor info for those who are on the fence about adding in the sour creamoverall a good dish and pretty quick when using leftover or storebough mashed potatoes we will make this again with a few changes
4,pretty good but make sure to use a skillet i also recommend changing the last step i used a cast iron skillet amp after adding the cheese i put it under the broiler for a couple of minutes
4,excellent easy fast and enough to freeze for another time just hubby and me
4,this was very easy to put together from start to finish minutes substitutions instead of frozen corn i used a can of yellowwhite corn which i drained omitted the peas as my boyfriend does not care for peas browned the hamburger with the onion amp garlic and used johnnys seasoning salt on the meat for the mashed potatoes i used a package of idahoan bacon with cheese mashed potatoes adding about c extra water then right before serving i put it under the broiler to get the cheese browned my boyfriend said its a keeper
4,i have not yet prepared this dish but just by reading the ingredients and the instructions it sounds very easy to make and also very tasty its now on my must try list of recipes ill add in some sauted mushrooms since my family and i like them otherwise this dish sounds terrific to me and i cant wait to make it
4,good meal
4,easy weeknight dinner the sauce needs a little extra seasoning
4,edit made with miracle whip light was much better especially the next daythis looks and sounds unappetizing but intrigued by the numerous star reviews i went ahead and made it i only had low fat mayo no miracle whip so i used that i only put one onion in because it looked like a lot but might add half or all of the second onei was expecting it to taste like coleslaw and macaroni salad i think it pretty much tastes like coleslaw with a bit of pasta added it makes a ton
4,i thought it was delicious took a big bowl to a church potluck and most people passed it by i think if theyd have tried it theyd have liked it dumped out a lot of it sadly
4,made this for a family gathering it was so good will make it again
4,i think you can use small macaroni in this recipe it taste wonderful made with mayo instead of mircle whip good recipe
4,i have made this salad many times everyone really likes it we dont like miracle whip so i use mayonnaise very good
4,it tasted fine but it just wasnt enough for me to want to make it again
4,quick simple and delicious
4,this is a really tasty cake plain but i see some cherry sauce in its future
4,i made this and loved it its simple and yet still good and shes right it would work great with any fruit and even as a strawberry shortcake but for simple its still yummy and you can eat it without frosting
4,i thought this cake was good but not really anything to rave about if i ever make it again i will probably make a frosting for it poke holes into it for pudding or cut it up to be used in some other sort of dessert
4,made this early one sunday morning when my daughter and granddaughter came up stairs for breakfast my daughter told her daughter that it was breakfast cake and she ate it the following sunday she asked if we could have breakfast cake again yes we did
4,this recipe was super good and easy i believe the yield says twelve but i assure you it would serve many more i brought this up to my cabin during the fourth of july and it really went well with every main dish we made i didnt have cider vinegar or celery so i went without and i still thought it was delicious i would definetely bring it to a potluck to share with friends
4,pretty salad that is very tasty adding this to family favorites
4,excellent
4,this salad was easy to prepare it and it makes quite a bit perfect for a crowd it was bland for me i feel like it needed more seasoning might try some seasoned salt next time
4,very good it does make alot will make again
4,big hit ive made it twice and will be making it again
4,i used mayonnaise instead of the miracle whip and added some salt and pepper good coleslaw recipe but now i want to find a recipe for the reversemacaroni salad with a bit of coleslaw mixed in
4,really good and easy too i used a combo of bacon and sausage that worked out well
4,this was kind of boring by itself but a good standard to add green chilies and spices could probably also use only one cheese
4,enjoyed the cottage cheese made it creamy easy to make and i used turkey sausage vs bacon
4,i liked how the whole dish was cooked on the stovetop rather than a mix of stovetop and oven it was more convenient i changed a few things i used beef broth instead of water and bouillon and i didnt have worcestershire sauce so i replaced it with bbq and hot sauce past shepherds pie recipes have been extremely bland so i think the bbq sauce and hot sauce actually made the recipe more enjoyable for us
4,ive made this a few times and i always add diced tomatoes mushrooms and garlic and i substitute the ground beef with seasoned ground turkey i top it with more mozzarella and parmesan cheeses one jar of ragu is enough for mebut either way it always comes out good and beats standing over a stove for hours
4,this recipe is in my regular rotation i like using a pound of italian sausage but either way is good taste belies the effort
4,my year old granddaughter enjoys cooking with me i was looking for a very easy recipe for the two of us to make and this worked well she loves watching cooking shows on tv and decided we should add more sauce the next time i think i would also add some garlic and add onions as i brown the beef
4,i would suggest adding onions and garlic while browning the beef and add the sauce after the beef is cooked so the beef would be equally spread throughout all the layers it wouldnt add to the labor and it makes the dish more flavorful its an easy recipe and next time i will try with refrigerated ravioli because thats what i have
4,the first time i made it it was a little dry since there is not much sauce i then added a nd oz jar and it came out perfect very good
4,this went together super easily and was very good i think maybe i would use a bit more spaghetti sauce or maybe i used a few too many raviolis i did not use the basil i will make this again for sure
4,this was very good and very easy i did substitute italian sausage as many suggested and i agree that the finished product would have been way too bland with just ground beef my only thought on this recipe is that ravioli pasta is much thicker than sheets of lasagna so add more meat and cheese to compensate
4,very easy to make and tasted good
4,very easy dinner to make
4,this recipe was so super simple with only three ingredients that most people will have on hand my daughter isnt much of a ravioli fan but she loved this recipe i am totally adding this to our weeknight rotations comes together in a snap
4,i added garlic salt and pepper along with italian seasoning but the dish as a whole was big hit
4,read the reviews and was a little nervous to make this i added the tsp of salt and i changed the vanilla to tablespoons it turned out very good its a good base cake plenty of options came to mind after i tasted it
4,very nice and fluffy my family loved it soft and spongy i added tablespoons of coco powder to theflour and it turned out really well thanks for such sweet recipe
4,could you tell me if you have ever put this in a bundt pan instead of the x pan
4,very good as a snack with evening tea
4,the cake tasted good but it was not light and fluffy it was heavey and had the texture of a pound cake can anyone tell me what may have caused this
4,pjust made this today and it is a good basic cake that is easy and quick i baked my in a bundt pan for about minutes i only had whole milk used organic unsalted butter decreased the sugar to cups increased the vanilla to tsp added tsp salt my mother was an excellent baker and even when the recipe didnt call for salt she always put a little in all her baked goods i also added a tsp of king arthurs princess cake and cookie flavoring the cake is similar to a pound cake but not quite i sprinkled it with confectioners sugar and will be serving it with fresh strawberries and whip cream next time i will try making cupcakes ill let you know if it doesnt work but i have a feeling it willp
4,i want to make this casserole for company has anyone tried making it and freezing it ahead of time
4,does anyone know if this can be made ahead and frozen it is delicious and id like to have it in the freezer for unexpected company
4,lot of potatoes and potato taste in this recipe almost tastes like a hashbrown casserole
4,good flavor but mine turned out a little on the dry side i think it needs a little milk
4,simple oldfashioned delicious cake would be great to use for strawberry shortcake as others have mentioned somewhat reminiscent of a good twinkie sponge
4,i tried this recipe today it turned out good amp was very delish
4,i havent tried it yet but wonder how the amish prepared potatoes for it im sure they didnt use frozen hash browns
4,i made this for our christmas morning breakfast and we really enjoyed it now that ive tried it once i would add some additional ingredients next time i made it
4,i made this casserole yesterday with lb of breakfast sausage its okay but dont think it has enough flavor that i would make it again
4,i made this last night someone else went to the store for me and picked up both ravioli and tortellini i used italian sausage browned with an onion the ravioli went on the bottom and the tortellini on the top layer since i cannot stand the taste of jarred spaghetti sauce i used a refrigerated one buitoni i have found that their marinara sauce to be the closest to homemade when i served it the ravioli was too chewy and flavorless i will go with all tortellini next time my dinner was a ht
4,good and easy recipe
4,good recipe kids loved it its a keeper
4,dish is good just wish i would have added more meat and sauce to the dish a pound is just not enough for this dish in my opinion also next time i may add sausage to it as well
4,this was really good and simple i made this camping oven in trailer and i dont normally do anything too complex due to sizeroom constraints will definitely make again but will use italian sausage instead of hamburger
4,really easy love virtually no cleanup love more i added some seasonings and such to the sauce but just to spice things up good concept but we were disappointed overall think it was the frozen cheese ravioli not a big selection in our region for frozen pasta think ill try a chicken artichoke alfredo version next time and use a refrigerated pasta instead of frozen also will cut the recipe in half for the two of us not bad though will keep working at it
4,i was really surprised that this dish was not runny with using frozen ravioli this was so easy and delishious i used mild italian sausage its what i had on hand and a little extra italian seasoning to our liking thank you for sharing will be making this more often
4,so easy to make and delicious perfect weeknight cooking
4,can you use fresh ravioli or do you have to cook it first
4,
4,very easy to make will make again i used beef ravioli
4,easy to put together and the kids loved it
4,one more blue ribbon for this recipe it won my chili cookoff at work beating out variations of red chili the only thing i did differently was not to rinse and drain the beans halved the onions and added a teaspoon of yoders habanero sauce from shipshewana in at the very end with the cream
4,used cheese to cut down on cal amp fat will use finely shredded next time
4,these are very similar to paula deens chicken georgia recipe
4,very good i think next time i wont add the extra salt i think with the chicken broth it added enough salt it was very tasty and moist will definitely make again
4,my husband loves this recipe the only thing i find is i have to bake much longer than the minutes sometimes an extra minutes
4,my grandmother made this and when it came out of the oven she would spread some butter on it then sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on it
4,pchicken is tender and very good one of my favorites my mom makes this often and i asked her for the recipe now i can make it alsop
4,this is a great cake for strawberry shortcake we usually prefer biscuits but this cake is a nice change i reduce the sugar just a bit cup less as its a bit sweet i also add a pinch of salt i bake in a inch pan for minutes check with a toothpick minutes before the directions state you dont want a dry cake when i sugar my strawberries i keep them a bit tart to offset the sweetness of the cake this is a little bit fussy but it really is a delicious cake
4,it came out exactly as described the negative comments id hazard to guess just cant cook that said i didnt particularly like it but what do you really expect to get from a hot milk cake ffs
4,my family really liked this casserole the next time i make it i want to try other veggies and meat i think you can do a lot with this and it will always taste good
4,very quick to put together and tasted really good will certainly make again
4,very easy and good motleygirl no cooking ravioli it cooks in the sauce in the oven if it doesnt say to cook it dont if you precook it the pasta will beswollen and overdone chewy not a stupid question at all i learned from experience
4,comforting is the perfect title for this noodle soup super fast and very good i used up some frozen egg noodles i had and it almost tasted homemade kids loved it because no veggies they dont count the carrot and celery sticks i served on the side
4,i added more cheese and italian sausage with the groundbeef it was very easy to make and all my kids said it was good to eat
4,a very easy reipe and very tasty everyone loved it
4,good easy cheap and quick all good things added mushrooms artichoke hearts and lots more cheese mmm good
4,great with ground turkey and spinach ravioli for something a little less fatty but just as delicious
4,we used the ground beef would be even better with sausage and added onions garlic mushrooms dried parsley rosemary and thyme this dish is easy and hearty will make it again this winter using sausage this time
4,made this for dinner tonight pretty tasty i read other comments that it came out too think so i i used water and chicken broth only added can of soup and a cup sour cream also added carrots and onion
4,thats a lot of water im by myself does anyone have suggestions for half that seems it wold be very watery thanks
4,great soup its not watery as it sits it gets thicker i did add some chopped onion celery and carrots
4,i cut the recipe in half but forgot to cut the spices in half because of that this had a lot of bite also used white kidney beans as we cant get great northern beans where i live next time when i make it properly i think i will still cut back on the cumin and cayenne pepper
4,this is very good my family enjoyed it it wasnt very soup like though so i added more stock because it was thick
4,peggycamp baking cocoa is cocoa powder it is unsweetened and in the baking section of the storeas with a few other reviews i always substitute coffee for the waterit enhances the chocolate you will not taste the coffee
4,this was a yummy moist cake the frosting threw me a bit i think i will use cream cheese in it next time overall good easy to follow recipe the turns outs beautifully
4,loved the consistency of the cake and the frosting was very easy to workthe cake is not as sweet as a typical cake due to the brown sugar but rather has a very rich complex flavor and is wonderfully dense if you have to bring a showstopper dessert to impress your friends fire up the oven
4,i made this for a teachers birthday everyone including the st graders loved it its a very easy recipe to follow and turns out just like the picture
4,this was good it is chicken season to your own taste duh why are not intelligent people even trying to cook the recipe ingredients tell you how much chicken and step tells you when to put on the cheese do you people need help crossing the street
4,omit the salt and use low or no sodium broth plenty of salt in the cheese your ankles will thank you
4,i liked this recipe used boneless chicken thighs and yellow onions i sauteed the onions before i browned the chicken i will be making this again thanks for sharing
4,i didnt pound the chicken but let the breasts cook until their temperature was about degrees very good recipe
4,i added a handful of left over italian sausage from the previous nights lasagna omitted thw swiss cheese and used freshly shredded potatoes it turned out a bit dark from the fresh potatos but we all really enjoyed it there was enough for left overs the next morning which were even better
4,this was easy and tasty i would add garlic to the mushroom saute next time and double the recipe i bet itd be great as leftovers
4,cake was good not the frosting we didnt care for it at all
4,the frosting has a tangy taste to it kinda different but not badthe cake is moist but lacks chocolate flavor
4,this cake turned out great really moist and fudgy i did take others suggestions and use coffee instead of the water i cant rate the frosting though some people said it tasted strange and i couldnt risk my picky eaters bday cake tasting weird
4,this is one dynamite cake if you havent tried it please do you cant go wrong i never use coffeejust follow the recipe
4,the cake itself was excellent and i will absolutely make again very thick three layers and super moist i was not thrilled with the frosting it has a sharp taste to it possibly from the sour cream it ended up tasting primarily like powdered sugarsour instead of being chocolatey like i was hoping nonetheless i received many compliments and as some other commenters have said it does keep well for several days
4,made this cake this weekend wonderful it is not a fluffy cake but a moist fudge texture i was hoping for a much richer chocolate flavor the frosting goes on smooth and make the frosting cake look nice i will definitly make this again but next time i will add expresso powder to the cake
4,easy to make tasty i halved the recipe and made cupcakes baked for about minutes they were a little too full next time i will make a few more so they dont overflow
4,what temp and time would you use for x cake or is it x sounds great
4,the first time i baked this i forgot to add the boiling water i thought it would be really dry but it was still surprisingly delicious currently have this recipe in the oven with the boiling water added this consistency after adding the boiling water worried me it seemed a little too liquidy than other cake recipes i have made is this normal
4,the cake is great one of the best chocolate cakes ive ever had however i am surprised how many good reviews there are on the frosting i didnt like the taste of it others i served it to liked it but i could taste the sour cream i think a homemade buttercream would be delicious on this cake
4,this is a deliious breakfast casserole my entire family enjoyed it i am making it again this weekend while we are snowed in thank you for submiting it
4,used chicken stock added carrots celery and onion seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before cooking it cooked cups of noodles separately the soup is bland but indeed comforting
4,what a tasty and simple recipe this is comfort food at its best for the cold weather
4,my husband was wanting chicken soup and i found this recipe i read the reviews and made some of the suggested changes along with some of my own i poached the chicken and then slightly shredded it added carrots celery and onion i used amish noodles giving more homemade flavor i then added salt pepper garlic powder and some parsley stirred in just before serving i also omitted the sour cream didnt really fit with the soup my husband tore it up he ate bowls i also served it with whole wheat french bread
4,i took this to a potluck yesterday and received many compliments i too added carrots can drained cut up a little in the can before adding to soup and finely diced onion and celery cooked in broth until soft the night before while i was cutting up the chicken i agree that maybe cups of noodles would have been plenty gave this stars instead of because all those noodles soaked up all the broth while it was on low in the crock pot during the party even with my adding lots of extra broth it was so good i will make it again but with less noodles and not for a longstandingtime event
4,made this for the first time using the frozen sugared sliced strawberries and it seems to have made the jello not set right has anyone else had this issue should i have have rinsed them off first i bet it will still be good i normally use fresh strawberries and have not had this issue
4,i enjoyed the soup but cups of uncooked egg noodles was way too much cups would have been plenty i added fresh carrots celery onion and garlic the veggies could have soaked up some of the broth but i doubt it would have left me with that little
4,this is a delicious dessertsalad one that our family enjoys on most holiday dinners and so easy to make we never tire of it the savory and sweet really compliment each other jean
4,sarah gelatin has a working temperature range and heating it too high will denature it effectively removing its gelling capabilities the recipe says to boil water then dissolve the jello in a bowl that doesnt cook it any further and the bowl actually brings the temperature down did you dissolve it in the pot while still simmeringboiling i wouldnt even boil the water just get it hot enough to dissolve the jello hope this helps and is in time for you to try again cheers
4,i was looking for the recipe my grandma used and while this is close its not the right recipe the jello layer is too thick and the middle layer is too loose however out of all the recipes my relatives have tried since my grandma passed away this is the closest i think i will use one box of jello and one package of strawberries next time and for the filling cups of cool whip and powdered sugar instead ill let you know how it goes still a tasty dessert with this recipe
4,in regards to happycamperd comment about it being really sweet i used fresh strawberries that i froze and sugar free jello and it tastes just as good
4,i used about cups of pretzels to fit the x dish to get enough base to cover bottom of dish i found it interesting that it only called for the boiling water to make the jello but it worked the jello box calls for two cups boiling and two cups ice cold water my guess is person who commented they had too much jello followed recipe on jello box and not this recipe i sliced up frozen strawberries as i didnt have presliced and added them when not completely thawed to act as substitute for cold water and it worked the jello doesnt look as pretty as picture but that may be because i let it sit too long to gel in freezer
4,easy to make but too sweet for our taste im going to try making it again using less sugar
4,pretty good i followed recommendations to use melted butter cut the sugar amp used buttermilk i also made it flour to cornmeal amp soaked the cornmeal to eliminate any gritty taste one thing i usually do to up the flavor is to add pureed corn but i didnt have time next time
4,heavier than id like which is why i didnt give it stars but the taste is good and it has good crumb maybe i need another t baking powder
4,i cut the sugar to cup i would not do that again it was not sweet enough i would also swape one cup flour for one cup cornmeal
4,this is a very good and moist cornbread really liked the flavor only thing is too much flour causing it to have too much of a cake texture next time i make this i think i will add less flour and more cornmeal overall a very good cornbreadbetter than any other recipe ive tried
4,so i really liked this cake a lot however i totally forgot to add the water i completely missed it i really just thought the water was in the ingredients to melt the chocolateduh my fault so for those of you that made brownies like methis is probably whylol
4,this cake is fantastic however the frosting is missing an ingredient my frosting is really thin its not as thick as in the video like another reviewer wrote the frosting ingredients are incomplete please help
4,i have a feeling the people who did not get a rise in the cake used baking powder instead of baking soda
4,this is a delicious cake but i have difficulty getting the layers out of pans intact and frosting it because its so delicate what am i doing wrong
4,being from a state where beef is whats for dinner my initial reaction to this recipe was less than excitement but the reviews convinced me to give it a try we really liked it a lot i had to thicken it up a little with some cornstarch to suit my chili tastes next time i make it i will add a vegetable like cabbage or corn to increase the textural diversity but overall this is a really good chili and i will make it again
4,to avoid issues that some people had you must pay close attention to kitchen tips listed amp details cool crust completely i chill the crust after it has cooled a bit on counter be sure to spread the cream cheese layer all the way to outer edges so that it is touching the edges of the panthen chillthis avoids letting the jello topping seep down into the crust do not cut the amount of sugar in the crustpart of recipeit is needed to make it crispyto speed up the jello portion i dissolve the sugar c to cup not full cup into only cup boiling waterthen when sugar is fully dissolved i add in the remaining cup very cold water or cold juice drained off from thawed strawberries to equal cup be very sure the jello is partially set before spooning evenly over chilled cream cheese layeryou do not want the jello fully set but you do not want it to be a pourable liquid either if the jello fully sets before you get to itjust warm slightly for a few seconds at a time in the microwave till it is semi set bt not warm sometimes i grate some dark chocolate over the whipped cream garnish dallops before adding the pretzel garnishif i remember to pick up some chocolate covered pretzels for the garnishgood recipe but the directions could include more specific details and the sugar in the jello could be cut down to cupmaybe even c especially if the frozen strawberries are sweetened type
4,we love the flavors togetherthe sweet and salty i had to make crusts in order to completely fill my x pan i think it would be better to have a thicker cream cheese filling it was definitely not as thick as the picture seemed to take quite awhile at least hours for the gelatin layer to partially set then again maybe it set too much because it seemed to slide off the cream cheese layer once it was cut i like the idea of using a oz container of fresh strawberries instead of the frozen
4,this is a delicious dessert made recipe as is and the jello strawberry layer did not set and was soupy it was suggested next time to layer fresh sliced strawberries on top of cool whip layer and then once the jello mix has sighty set to carefully pour over strawberries if you make the recipe as is i would suggest using a packet or two of the knox gelatin or draining some of the syrup from the strawberries no one complained about the taste or it being soupy so it was a win regardless next time ill read the other reviews before jumping in
4,my kids enjoyed this it was ok to me i think i would of liked it better with fresh strawberries and not frozen next time ill try with fresh the flavor was good though
4,i would use an x dish for this recipe and i cut the pretzels to about cups otherwise its too much crunch
4,pmy husband and i really enjoyed this baked spaghetti my only change i made was to leave out the olives because we arent fans of them next time to appeal more to the kids i will likely used crushed tomatoes instead of diced because they turned their noses up at the tomato chunks and be sure to dice up the peppers smaller than i didp
4,i made it it was easy to make and i liked the buttery smooth texture and flavor it complimented my bean soup very well do i prefer corn bread without sugar depends on what mood im in and what im eating it with if i were having it with greens id probably prefer the old fashioned no sugar cornbread
4,my husband and i had this with a big pot of ham and beans it adjust enough sweetness it is a big recipex so next time ill probably cut in half it tasted really good with the beans on the coldest night this year
4,theeee best ive ever eaten
4,if you let your batter sit for around min you will not have grainy corn bread
4,this is how my husband makes his neighborhood famous cornbread except he substitutes the last four ingredients for a package of jiffy cornbread mix he also only adds three tablespoons of sugar rather than a full cup half a cube of butter one egg teaspoon of oil and it turns out great everyone loves it so easy he also uses whole milk
4,im from the south and dont put any sugar in cornbread so i made it without and it was really good my mother always used some hot bacon grease in hers
4,i made this to go with easter ham dinner everyone enjoyed it but mine was very dense not light and fluffy like some have stated still very enjoyable and moist the next day
4,pretty good came out golden brown and served it as a side dish with red beans and rice i used skim milk but otherwise followed directions next time i would decrease the sugar a little bit maybe cup but otherwise no changes makes plenty
4,should have read other reviews before making it seemed like a version jiffy cake mixvery similar
4,i love this recipe but i put spaghetti sauce in mine we like it much better with the sauce
4,i will try this recipe but definitely need to add garlic also i would use mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar cheese love cheddar cheese but pasta needs garlic and mozzarella
4,i used italian sausage instead of ground beef it was really good makes a lot
4,used this recipe for the first time for a christmas party this year i knew there was going to be a crowd so i doubled the recipeit made a huge amount the baked spaghetti was the hit of the party we didnt bring one bit home did increase the amount of cheese i mixed the cheese into the spaghetti before putting it in the baking dish really spread the cheesy around nicely love love love this recipe the family has been begging me to make it again already
4,i liked this because i felt it was a little different than the typical baked spaghetti casserole my boyfriend said he would have liked it better with more tomatoes i personally like the cream of mushroom sauce on the top and wouldnt change it if it were for just me
4,very good although i made it without olives dont care for them also made a side portion without meat for the vegetarian everyone enjoyed it
4,i made this with keilbasa and no green peppers or mushroomsit was wonderful
4,fairly easy to make and rather tasty we all went in for seconds on this one
4,really good but were a bit spongy and some didnt rise
4,i used up some leftover uncooked pasta shells spirals and didnt blend the tomatoes and paste since i dont have a blender everything still turned out well i usually prefer something other than chicken in my pasta dishes but overall not a bad dinner
4,this was tasty and the house smelled wonderful as it cooked we really liked it but didnt love it it took a fair amount of prep too
4,i made this and i think it has great flavor i just dont understand why it was so soupy i cooked my pasta al dente to have it soak up some of the juice next time i will omit the juice from the tomatoes and cut back on the chicken broth by cup
4,so good and very easy to make
4,this did not take as long to make as i thought it would i did do a few short cuts though i didnt blend the tomatoes and it turned out just fine i only simmered the chicken mixture minutes and only left the dish in the oven for minutes after uncovering it still was delicious ground beef or sausage could easily replace the chicken im not a big fan of chicken in red sauces but most dishes of this kind use beef or sausage so the chicken was a nice change of pace the chicken could even be shredded or cut very small so its not as noticeable this could easily be prepared ahead of time for a busy next day prepare the chicken mixture and refrigerate since its the step that takes the longest or prepare the entire dish and bake it the next day we are a family of and so there is only a few small servings left over next time i may double it and bake it in a x pan instead of an x
4,pretty good i followed this recipe except for the salt and red pepper flakes the chicken was tender and had lots of flavor
4,i make this quite often and every time i do even folks like my mother who swear they dont like chicken chili love it i think it is absolutely perfect the only change i make is using fresh garlic and toasting and grinding my own cumin seeds love love love this
4,my husband doesnt like lots of beans so i only added one can of beans in exchange i added a can of drained corn i also added c sour cream and c plain lowfat yogurt i also added green onions it turned out great
4,good but was time consuming
4,this is yummy
4,very good could use a little more spice
4,i usually try to make a recipe once the correct way and then make changes on the second time but for our maiden voyage tonight my whole family liked this a lot and they didnt think we needed to do anything differently in the future as someone else wrote it seems a nice way to serve spaghetti to switch things up a bit very nice
4,gad i love everything about the looks and sound of this cant wait for a free night
4,made this for a work function and it was an odd recipe but it was quite delicious it was a hearty meal to feed a bunch of hungry guys at first we were nervous when it was spaghetti with cream of mushroom soup but the combo actually made a delicious topping
4,this is a nice change from traditional spaghetti i left out the olives since my family doesnt like them
4,this was delish laholm you can use a simple white sauce flour milk butter instead of the canned soup
4,yum i also dont like canned soup i make a white sauce amp add lots of mushrooms i eliminate the green peppers and olives just my preference
4,i made for a church function today and used crushed tomatoes and added another can of mushroom and a heaping teaspoon of minced garlic but pretty much kept the rest the same oh substituted wine for the water and next time will definitely add wine to the sauce the bottom layer was too dry so will add sauce to the pasta before putting that layer down and before adding the burger to the sauce probably will make more sauce but all in all pretty well receivedthen again could probably be very good without layering and just mixing it all together definitely would cut prep time
4,wasnt sure my husband would like it due to the mushrooms but he loved it great flavors black olives really livened it up
4,this is a good recipe the only things i did different was to omit the mushrooms and olives and instead of oregano i used italian seasoning i also used roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup per another reviewer and for the tomatos i used hunts diced tomatoes with basil garlic amp oregano good flavor will make agan
4,these were good but i did take others advice and cut the sugar down to cups and they were still a little sweet for me but yummy all the same
4,i made exactly as directed easy and a good recipe my family of enjoyed and my husband just took the leftovers to his card night so hopefully the guys will like it also
4,i originally got all mixed up and put the pineapple in the cake and the mandarin orange in the topping which i made with oz cream cheese instead of the whip topping yesterday i made this again and was careful to follow directions exactly i very much preferred my mixed up version and will be making it that way from now on
4,one of the best desserts on the planet
4,this should be stars but the website wont let me give it stars
4,you can make this cake up to two days ahead and it actually tastes better than when made and eaten on the same day it tastes very rich but isnt nice cake for springtime
4,how long do u leave it
4,me and my mom made it but it did not tast done so we put it in up to an hr but it steel was not done
4,simple and good however i didnt do the local lofat noyolk method wo guilt next time i will use mandarin oranges instead of pineapple in the topping as well as in the cake the pineapple overpowers the orange flavor which i love to almost nonexistent
4,i made this cake for guests and every one loved iti thought it was easy and good
4,i made this cake for guests and we all loved it i thought it was easy and good
4,this was so simple to make very moist and tasty and much more volume than a regular cake good pot luck dessert
4,this recipe is delicious however i have made it more than once and the frosting is always super liquidy no clue why ive even tried making it with extra powdered sugar
4,made as directed thought it was better the next day when the flavors came through better was rather bland when we had it for supper the evening i made it
4,still needs more flavor this will probably be better tomorrow it takes a very long time to make though so im not sure if ill make this again i think its a great base recipe for sure i wanted to rate this as is and not make any changes
4,i made this recipe for my family last night and it was a hit i added tbsp of chinese chili sauce instead of the flakes added cloves of garlic and used boneless chicken breasts my picky children and picky hubby loved it i served this dish with oven toasted italian garlic bread
4,fantastic flavor quite zippy too the one major thing id change is that the peppers got quite soggy cooking as long as the chicken next time im going to add them at the earliest halfway through the chickencooking time the rest of it was fantastic
4,oh and i also completely forgot the chicken stock it was still a little thin so i added some cornstarchwater mix and it got nice and dense
4,my family really enjoyed this casserole it gave a little different taste then the usual spaghetti or lasgana i have five children and every one of them enjoyed this i used chicken breast marinated in a garlic dressing instead of the thighs since i dont care for dark meat thanks for the great recipe
4,recipe was easy and a quick after work fix taste was good will definitely make a again
4,at first i made the recipe exactly as written the flavor was great but they spread a lot in the oven the second time i whipped the egg whites until fluffy and then gently folded in the remaining ingredients no more spreading and i was able to get more cookies out of the mixture so yummy
4,i made this as a bundt cake very moist and delicious a little too sweet for my taste with the frosting so will make it again without frosting and perhaps will cut down on sugar
4,this was a pretty good meatloaf i usually dont like putting raw onion in meatloaf want to saute it but this came out really well will definitely make it again
4,to buddystar rubbed sage is just crushed sage that is rubbed between your fingers and then added to your mix this is a very good recipe but i omit the sage but at times i will add some chopped green pepper
4,the only thing i changed was half the sugar i dont like sweet meat yum
4,great
4,very good and very tasty i changed a little bit by replacing some of the crumbs with bran and added garlic
4,my polish granny made this for years from scratchi would like the try this quicker version than compare
4,nice light refreshing cake my husband does not have a sweet tooth so he appreciated this cake the most he cant stand super sweet buttercream type frostings the mixture of pudding pineapple and whipped topping was perfect the cake was much more spongey than most cakes which made it come out of the pan without any problems at all i think i overmixed it because there were very few discernible bits of mandarin orange in it next time ill mix it less for sure thanks for this lovely alternative to the heavier sweeter quick desserts
4,this is now my favorite cake it turned out flavorful and moist and best of all the caloriecount is reasonable for a dessert i added teaspoons of orange extract to bumpup the orange flavor bettyann in san antonio texas
4,i have made this cake many times it is a favorite in our family but i changed it to use banana pudding mixsugarfree and use a small can of crushed pineapple which is sufficient also use cup canola oil instead of applesauce my great grandsons special cake it tastes like a banana flip
4,i modified this recipe for the slow cooker i used about cups of cooked shredded chicken and omitted the oil i then added all the other ingredients except the creams to the slow cooker i also added an extra cans of beans i slow cooked on low for hours and then added the creams about min hour before serving it was delicious and i was very happy with the way i turned out in the crock i have added it to my will make again recipe collection
4,i made this recipe in two batches one with whipping my egg whites into stiff peaks then combining the next one without whipping my egg whites the whipped egg whites batch turned out excellent crispier with a bit more depth the nonwhipped recipe still turned out tasty however i found it comparable to a mounds candy bar without the chocolate coating im looking forward to trying this recipe with the traditional almond extract or maybe lemon
4,i never do these but i read the reviews and made the macaroons it never ceases to amaze me how people can supposedly follow the same recipe with such different results toll house cookies being the prime example anyway sorry i did change it a little i have made macaroons before and just wanted to experimenthowever i didnt change any measurements just tweaked things a little i used almond flour rum instead of vanilla added some candied ginger and a dark chocolate button on top theyre fabulous but i mainly wanted to mention how they came together they didnt but i piled them in heaps on the cookie sheet anyway and theyre fine also this recipe with no change in amounts on the ingredients made big macaroons macaroons are so rich and sweet and basically unhealthy most recipes dont recommend making them very big cant figure out how people could think the recipe doesnt make enough last of all i think the freshness of the eggs makes a difference staler egg whites are watery i could have used a little of that
4,these are good macaroonshowever you need to beat egg white until frothy with solid peaksadd cream of tartar to make whites turn out better add sugar and vanilla to whites and then add to coconut mixture bake at not also bake for minutes not
4,ive never made macaroons before and i made these twice in hours i have a couple of cookie events coming up and had coworkers try them they raved about them i did cut the sugar drastically only because i dipped them in chocolate which added a lot of sweetness congrats on your blue ribbon
4,good recipe anyone whose ever made these kinds of cookies knows you need to whip the egg whites unsure why people get mad about that i made it keto style with unsweetened coconut coconut flour and stevia came out just like your photo and they taste great thank you for the recipe
4,i loved this meatloaf i would have given this a star however my family did not like the barbecue sauce
4,very good flavor for a traditional meatloaf
4,this meatloaf was very good my whole family loved it and my husband is not a meatloaf guy i didnt have any problems with it being dry at all or falling apart i give it stars only bc it was a little too sweet for me as well and without the sauce the meat was pretty bland although my husband liked the fact that the meat wasnt overly seasoned bc the sauce had a great taste the only thing i may do next time is season the meat a little more and probably not put as much brown sugar but i wouldnt make many changes bc my family husband and kids loved it i paired it with some mashed potatoes and green beans overall a great meal
4,delicious this recipe is good i just changed two little thing instead of c sugar i do tbs and the sauce i pore everything on the meatloaf made it like this every time including the very first love taste of home recipes everything i made was delicious
4,my family really liked this one and while i did too i think i might tweak it a little maybe a little diced green pepper in it or a little more worcestershire sauce definitely a keeper though
4,i have made this and easy meatloaf several times for this recipe we really like the ketchup mixture topping
4,i havent tried this recipe but it seems like it is an awful lot of calories for just one piece of meatloaf that is almost your whole meal worth of calories donalee
4,i made a bundt cake instead of cupcakes its a very moist cake very yummy although very sweet it didnt even need frosting but was yummy nevertheless im going to make it again but will use less sugar
4,not as creamy as the picturemore like a soup but delicious
4,watch the size egg you use after i mixed all ingredients the batter was very runny i noticed i had used jumbo eggs thats all we had at the time the recipe does not say what size eggs to use but obviously not jumbo i added more coconut to the runny batter and the macaroons turned out great next time ill use smaller eggs perhaps some clarification on the size of eggs to use would help
4,lovely recipe the ingredients arent enough for the amount that it says they should yield i doubled the recipe in hopes of having a full dessert i ended up with decent sized macaroons
4,these macaroons turned out great my family and coworkers loved them when i took them to work
4,these were delicious and very easy and to those who complaini followed the receipt to the tee and had wonderful resultsi find that when u change something then yu are bound to have something go wrong
4,ive made this twice and heres how i like it i doubled everything except the sugar and made larger cookies from a double recipe and i baked them only minutes
4,making this today as i have all ingredients think ill half it though as its just the of usthink hubby will love it
4,garnish with cilantro additions puree an additional can of beans to thicken chili season chicken with poultry seasoning to enhance the flavor add sliced cremini mushrooms for a heartier bowl
4,this white chili is awesome i have shared the recipe many times family and friend favorite
4,very good i didnt read the reviews first bad decision i was in a bind with little time and not enough potatoes to fill the bottom of a x in first layer i quickly made some instant potatoes not something i would make for christmas eve but was in a bind i mixed with the baked potatoes turned out great
4,i love this recipe cake is moist and flavorful i have found though that the baking time is off by about minutes i have increased baking time accordingly for the icing it calls for tablespoons of flour which is used for thickening the best icing i have ever had you wont be disappointed
4,a very moist cake i put sliced strawberries in between the layers topped it with whole strawberries and drizzled it with chocolatei would prefer a buttercream frosting over this one
4,pi liked this recipe quite a bit the one thing i would change is the amount of brown sugar i have a real sweet tooth but this seemed like a bit too much sugar to me especially for an entree next time i will likely reduce the amount of brown sugar by half but overall a very good meal loaf p
4,i have been carrying this recipe around since i found it in an issue of the taste of home magazine that is dated i have shared it with everyone that has asked for a moist chocolate cake and the icing recipe that is with this cake is excellent it is not sweet at all you can actually eat the whole piece of cake without scraping the icing off due to heavy sweetness i truely believe that every cook out there should have a copy of this recipe for it is the bestbarb smith
4,good recipe but the sauce was a bit too sweet and tasted more like a barbecue sauce i would cut the amount of sugar by half next time i baked mine in muffin tins at for about minutes
4,as im not eating meat at the moment i substituted the bacon for salmon flakes worked a treat
4,i didnt read views first but knew that ratios were off i halved the bacon cheeses and sour cream to the lbs of potatoes used oval baker smaller than x very yummy but maybe still less sour cream
4,if the reviewer thinks this is vile then it isnt a review is it its a recipe that is a treat not something one would prepare every day its like a loaded baked potato on a grand scale perhaps the person who thinks this is vile should go to a more mundane food websiteone for people who are afraid of food its all in how moderate you are btw my preference was to cut back a little on the sour cream and cheese i eliminated the mozzarella and used cheddar and jack added a little garlic powder and chives it was great with steak tips and green beans with mushrooms this is a bona fide review because i actually made it
4,my husband i liked this recipe it was a nice change of pace i did tweek it a little half the sour cream slices of bacon cup moss cheese and cups chedder thanks for sharing
4,excellent recipe but i missed the fact that the potatoes needed to be already baked before assembling the casserole mine turned out tasty but potatoes were still very undercooked even after adding minutes to the cooking time needless to say ill have to try this again
4,awesome recipe but listen to the reviewers that made modifications i doubled the amount of potatoes and only used cups of sour cream and it turned out great but if i make it again ill cut back on the sour cream even more it tasted wonderful though and everyone loved it
4,delicious i only used slices of bacon and not all of the sour cream cheese mixture but it was fantastic and my guests all asked for the recipe
4,while this recipe was a smash hit with me amp my family i would definitely have to say its miscatagorized theres nothing quick about this quick dinner recipe i mean for real who just has medium potatoes laying around already baked and cutting them into cubes once they are baked is next to impossible so before they even went into the oven to cook as a casserole id already spent nearly an hour on what was supposed to be a min prep time had my boys not told me how great it was amp what an awesome cook i am amp it actually taste really good i dont know if id even have made it again good thing my main dish could be reheated in the microwave or itd have been super cold by the time this was done
4,this recipe is good like it is or can switch it around a little by using the ranch dressing already mentioned also the potatoes can be cut up and boiled then drained and dried off with paper towel it would be quicker than baking them
4,made it for a family get together casserole did not last very long the men loved it
4,this was very easy and my family loved it i did use lowfat sour cream and my son added cheese to his bowl
4,the flavor in this was very good it is easy to double for a large kettle i found it slightly soupy for my taste but i added some mashed potato flakes and it was great the leftovers made a great base for green chili chicken enchiladas
4,cake is absolutely awesome prepared according to recipe without modification no issues with batter running over cake pans although one pan came close suggest using deep pans cook time was minutes frosting is a separate subject although it turned out without issues was not runny or grainy and did not have strong flour or shortening tastes i will not make it again the only positive thing i can say about it was that it was not a terribly sweet frosting which i liked i did not like all the fat and hydrogenated oils and will look elsewhere for a frosting recipe to compliment this outstanding cake
4,i made this for my grandsons birthday i did not use this frosting as chocolate frosting was requested it did take a little longer to bake but the awful part was while baking in two pans the batter ran over the top and i had a huge mess in the bottom of the open i would have to have put it in two pans when i make this again i will definitely use a x x pan
4,the cake is super moist however the flour and shotening in the icing should be swithed out because it gives the frosting a bad taste the amount of the frosting needs to be decreased because it ran over the cake and everywhere else some of the batter stuck to the bottom of the cake pan perhaps a lining of parchment paper would have been better other than that it was a wonderful cake
4,i was very nervous about baking a chocolate cake i have had my share of to drybut not this one it was wonderful the only adjustment i used just a little more then a quarter cup of coco powder the color was just right will bake again very very soon
4,i dislike coffee flavor of any kind could i substitute water i know coffee is supposed to enhance the flavor of chocolate but yucki love chocolate but cant even take mocha
4,athpro you will never taste the coffee i am a cake baker by trade and use it in all chocolate cakes i hate coffee too
4,this was really good even though i cheated and used canned frosting i had extra batter too
4,holy hot wings is right i thought i died and went straight to expletive it was so hot even my husband who loves anything burning his throat thought it was too hoti am going to make it again but this time use much less hot sauce i did use franks as some others recommended so maybe that was the problem i love the ingredients for a dip so im hopeful the next try will be better
4,oops i sent the wrong review please forgive me
4,i used chopped smoked ham instead of bacon and mixed it all togther instead of layering i lined the crockpot with a cooking bag and poured it all in cooked on low for hours delicious and you can do other things with the oven or just mix and forget about it it doesnt hurt to have it set longer
4,i made this once and everyone thought there was too much sour cream next time i will use less sour cream and add some italian spices and garlic to the potatoes this will add some flavor as it was a bit on the bland side
4,just looking at the recipe the cups of sour cream seemed overdone so i reduced the sour cream to oz used only pound bacon omitted the extra salt and reduced the amount of cheese though i didnt really measure that i had less than c of mozzerella so i sprinkled on some grated parmesan my lbs of potatoes seemed a little scant even in my smaller oval casserole so im really glad i had decided to reduce the other ingredientsbut overall it was very tasty and i will definitely be adding it to my potato dish rotation with my changes of course
4,yum tastes like a loaded baked potato i used a lb bag of potatoes and cups sour cream and liked the result also added green onions to the first layer as well as topping with them at the end will make again
4,i made this for easter and everyone really liked it i also made a separate one with only potatoes cheese and bacon both were delicious i used regular baking potatoes instead of red i will definitely make this again
4,this was really good my family all enjoyed it good leftovers also
4,i was looking for something different than the usual cheesy potato casserole followed the recipe as written and was not disappointed tastes great when i make it again i will use the entire lb bag of red potatoes final product was a bit more saucy than id have liked
4,this sounds so good but ill cut way back on the bacon use fat free sour cream and reduced fat cheese and ill bet the taste will be pretty much the same as with all the bacon and full fat cheeses
4,really easy and tasty loved it
4,i made this quickly after working a hr day i added sautéed chopped onion cumin sazon extra water salt onion powder and pepper as it was a little bland for my familys tastebuds we topped with sour cream amp shredded cheese fast amp easy
4,i made this with lean ground turkey for a healthier version and it was delicious we ate it all week and im making it again tonight
4,pyum just needs some extra humpf to get five starsp
4,this recipe is great however if you use only butter cop the frosting is much better whip butter and sugar till light and fluffythen continue as stated
4,hey how can i half this recipe but still use eggs and the rest i would like to half
4,loved loved loved this cake i not read the reviews beforehand did not use parchment paper but mine thankfully did not stick i had deep pans also so no overflowing either but i will say cook time was way offit was considerable more but it turned out so yummy very moist cake i will use again but with a differ icing was not a fan of that icing at all
4,i loved the cake so moist chocolaty and soft this will be my new go to chocolate cake recipe however we were not fans of the icing it was kindabland and runny not really runny but thinner than i would have liked
4,despite the degree temperature i made this because of all the peppers from our garden we thought it was a tasty soup i did add onion garlic and worcestershire sauce and substituted beef broth for the water
4,i made this several weeks ago with minor changes omitted the brown sugar and added hot paprika i also didnt add the rice until just shortly before we ate because i dont like mushy rice there wasnt a drop left
4,very good i did make a couple changes though i was worried about the brown sugar since i dont like meat to have any sweetness to it so i gradually added white sugar and decided t was enough i also added a t of garlic powder as for the rice i added a cup of uncooked instant rice toward the end of cooking time and it was still plenty soupy oh and i also added a small chopped onion when i browned the burger
4,very good i cooked the hamburger and peppers together and added an onion substituted beef broth for the water and left out the beef bouillon husband a very picky eater agreed that it was very good we ate ours with a little cheese on top
4,i do substitute beef broth and it could use more green peppers but it is yummy on a cold night i think that its funny that some folks substitute all of the ingredients is it still the same recipe
4,i love this recipe but my problem isnt the recipe itself but the comment made by the submitter that leads pple to believe they created this recipe the recipe has been around for a lot longer and theres a starlite tavern in pa that has one of the first versions of this not this place good either way though and i recommend it
4,recipe was very good with the exception of the rice i think it would work better with uncooked long grain rice otherwise the soup is too watery i ended up using x the amount of rice called for to make it thicker
4,i thought the tomato base tasted on the bland side so like one of the reviewers i added a couple dashes of garlic powder when browning the ground beef which definately zips it up plus i added about dashes of worcestershire sauce and shakes of cayenne pepper to the soup this recipe is easily customizable to your familys taste buds i will definately add to my recipe file thanks
4,this recipe was good i used beef broth in place of the water and the boullion and also only used half of the amount called for for a thicker soup the flavor was rather mild and could use some spice but it was good i added velveeta cubes on top that melted over the soup which greatly enhanced the soup makes tasty leftovers too
4,i cut this recipe in half and added a can of tomatoe soup its delicious
4,i would give it a star but it is just a little too watery for our taste i only used lb of hamburger and added extra rice but next time i will cut back a bit on the water
4,these cupcakes are easy to make and have a wonderful flavor the cream cheese frosting with added cinnamon is a hit and i will be using it for other cakes like carrot cake the cupcakes tend to collapse and become flat topped instead of the usual cupcake shape however the shape doesnt detract from the flavor my family loved them
4,too much icing left over could i use the already made cream cheese frosting in the tub
4,super easy to prepare and very tasty
4,i liked this but for me personally i tasted it before i cooked it and liked it better before it was baked everything is cooked so there is no danger of raw food it reminded me of a loaded baked potato salad that you can buy for a ridiculous price at the deli i would make it again but probably serve it cold as an alternative to the everyday yellow mustard potato salad
4,great basic recipe can use as is or adjust our family does like a little extra flavour in our food so we usually add more spices than a recipe calls for and i did add a few extras to make more soup to last longer with portions to freeze for later apart from the basic recipe i added can black beans diced green pepper diced white onion can leftover tomato soup just to avoid wasting it some cumin paprika black pepper garlic powder onion powder oregano parsley adobo seasoning chipotle chile powder and about cup of cheddar cheese and some more water i added black olives to mine but not the entire pot because a lot of people hate olives i love them though and they are a great addition then we topped as desired with sour cream cheddar cheese and crushed tortilla chips when serving it worked out great this recipe is versatile in how you can add to it or adjust it to make it work for you stretch it for extra servings i would have never thought about using the ranch dressing packet but that was a good idea
4,i only gave it four stars because i tweaked it a little i added chick peas and a dash of salt to mine as well as used ground turkey instead of beef to make it a little healthier and added an onion as well we topped ours with cheese sour cream and tortilla chips
4,this was really good i tweaked it a little to make it my own first i cooked this in my crockpot on low for hoursbrowning the meat first with the taco seasoning which i doubled for more flavor i also used beef broth instead of water i added another can of diced tomatoes in addition to the stewed and also added in a oz can of sliced black olives at the end of cooking i added in oz of cream cheese to make the soup a creamier version served it with some cheese sprinkled on top tortilla chips and sour cream my whole family loved it will definitely make it again
4,pretty good if youre looking for a quick easy recipe some people will complain about anything and everything as a professional athlete i understand that its important to have a healthy overall diet but not every meal has to be perfectly healthy your kids will be ok
4,i did not make this recipe as stated as i have been making my taco soup different after sauteeing the hamburg i add one large chopped onion with cloves garlic minced one to cans diced tomatoes with or without green chilies stewed tomato are great also add to this one to pkgs taco seasoning now add one to cans of black beans and same amount of canned corn or frozen corn add salt and pepper to taste and enough water to make the soup just right simmer for approx half hour i used to make this for my sisters restaurant in wyoming years ago everybody loves it please be sure to drain corn and beans no need to rinse some times i add some chili powder also
4,need nacho chips for a topping
4,soup is fine but the ranch dressing mix was left out of the the recipe shown had to look at the video to confirm that it was in there lol
4,this is basically the weight watchers taco soup recipe i use ground turkey healthier and more beans and throw in a dried chipotle pepper to make it more like chili than soup i also do not add the can of stewed tomatoes just two cans of the tomatoes with green chilies
4,tasty but way too sweet cut the brown sugar by at least half
4,this classic comeback was republished in the septoct issue where i saw it for the first time i just happened to have made stuffed green peppers the day before had two leftover so i combined this recipe with my leftovers and it was terrific now i may just make the soup and skip the stuffed green pepper altogether wonderful
4,make sure you stir occasionally as i didnt and some of the rice stuck to the bottom of the pan
4,soup needs onions and i wont be using brown sugar as for the rice i always cook it or pasta in a separate pot as was suggested to me by a friend who is a chef when you are ready to serve put rice or pasta in the bottom of bowl and ladle soup over the top no gross soggy rice or pasta ever again
4,i always follow a recipe exactly the first time i make it then make my own changes here is what i changed it was too watery with quarts of water so i used no water and a oz bottle of v also instead of all that rice i used half rice and half quinoa instead of beef bouillon granules i used roasted beef base absolutely delicious
4,excellent recipe i mixed red yellow and orange with the green pepper for color and a milder flavor i also added an extra pound of ground beef and served it over fresh bowtie pasta if desired on the side to add some substance and stretch the batch to all the enthusiastic consumers
4,this was very easy i used fresh tomatoes and beef broth instead of can tomatoes and the bouillon it felt like maybe something was missing for our tastes so i added garlic and cayenne pepper it was the little extra something we liked in our soup to take it to the next level i will definitely be making it again
4,this is nice
4,made this last night and husband loved it thats enough to make me add this to my recipe collection this is sure to be a regular at our house
4,family loved this soup
4,this is one tasty pot pie recipe its definitely a keeper in my household i believe in trying a recipe as written first and making adjustments later if needed so thats what i did many have said its very thick as written and i have to agree it tasted great but was overly thick for my liking the second time around i used a cup of flour and for me that was the perfect amount
4,lord hammercy this pie was a back breaker for me i had to keep thinning out the mixture with more chicken broth than anticipated but i finally got there thanks for a very tasty pie this recipe rocks will def make again
4,very good and summer good
4,i added tablespoon of lime juice to the recipe
4,i made this today for st patricks day it is so refreshing light and delicious
4,this was awesome light amp fluffy and low calorie i made it for work and even coworkers on a diet ate some
4,i actually made this with berry jello and whipped strawberry yougurt everyone that ate it loved it i cant wait to try this with another flavor
4,i made this pie for st patricks day and it was a big hit for an added touch i served it with green candied maraschino cherries and green sprinkles
4,i love this recipe i made my own graham cracker crustbetter than store bought amp easy to throw together you can definitely pick out the gelatin flavor you like and match a yogurt to it for peach strawberry or any flavor you like most of the ingredients i had on hand
4,my pies set up very well i tried it with nosugar red raspberry jello and reduced fat raspberry yogurt it disappeared as fast as the keylime pie
4,i made this pie for st patricks day as lime is not my favorite i will make it only for special occasions like st patricks day but it was quick and easy however i found that all the jello did not get completely folded in as there were a few chewy pieces of the jello spread throughout the pie i also found that the crust apparently absorbed some liquid from the filling as it was a little softer than i would have liked maybe that was because i used dream whip instead of cool whip which i did not have on hand and no time to go out and purchase some
4,this was greatand you dont feel terrible getting another piece i plan on making it again with other flavors
4,next time i would use a little more spices i only had half the tomato sauceso added oz of tomato with green chilles i also added tbs of worcestershire minced onions and garlic i would also add celery
4,this recipe gave me a starting point i had a bunch of peppers of many kinds chopped em up used ground turkey i had on hand plus a can of rotel and another of diced tomatoes threw in some clamato juice pretty tasty but i didnt think it went very well with rice which i kept on the side so i can freeze the soup leftovers when i that it out out i may add chili powder and beans as its a good base recipe for chili overall pretty tasty
4,i made it and it tasted great however a package of knox gelatin was needed to make it firm today instead of key lime i made it with strawberries excellent
4,great recipe we used carb master yogurt to cut the carbs my daughter is a type diabetic so we gotta watch those anybody knocking this recipe or anything sugar free some people arent as fortunate or have no choice with certain things my daughter can still consume sugars etc and to be honest white bread would spike her more then a snicker bar lol contrary to belief
4,very good amp easy
4,loved it i did not have key lime jello so i used unflavored gelatin and substituted lime juice for the water the pie was awesome this will be a repeat at our house
4,this is a good pie
4,i love key lime pie and dont eat it because of my diatbetes so was very excited to see this easy recipe for a lime flavored pie it was simple and very good still cant eat too much of it but its a nice treat i added some lime zest to it for extra flavor definitely make ahead of time so it has time to really firm up before serving giving it a rating only because it isnt really key lime other than what is in the yogurt
4,actually key lime juice is yellow not green and the limes themselves are more a yellow color theyre a lot different than regular limes but that is neither here nor there this is a very simple recipe for a nice treat especially for diabetics ive had this and its tasty
4,for those hung up on the color of this piekey lime pie really is not green unless food color is usedkey lime pie is a pale yellow green i intend to make this soonlooks so good and inexpensive and light on the calories and fat the other flavors people have mentioned sounds great too
4,i prepare a dessert bar for the fire depts monthly fundraising dinners and i always include a diabeticfriendly dessert i will definitely try this recipe key lime pies go over well with our guests so i know this keylimelike substitute will make our sugarconscious guests very happy i cant wait to try it with other flavors too this sounds like a winner thanks star rating for all things about it addl star missing only because i havent made it yet
4,quick and easy very light
4,really yummy i cut the recipe in half and ended up using the full amount of liquid and it still was not very soupy so that is the only thing i would change about it in the future
4,really good quick recipe i used diced tomatoes instead of the stewed and substituted salsa for the ranch seasoning i served it with crispy tortilla strips and shredded cheese
4,really good recipe my whole family liked it i added a little more water to make it more soupy and left out the can of pinto beans will make it again
4,this soup is really yummy i have had several requests for the recipe after having tasted the soup when ive made it this definitely does not happen with most of the recipes ive tried this one is a keeper i will be making it again and again
4,this is a really good soup for the whole family to enjoy after reading the reviews i did make a few minor adjustments i used black beans instead of pinto beans large oz canned diced tomatoes in place of stewed and diced w green chiles cans and more water to cups because i wanted a true soup i did add the can of green chiles and there was plenty of flavor i will definitely make this again
4,i had to moderate the recipe a little i added some elbow macaroni and left out the diced tomatoes with chiles my husband and i both have acid reflux i still enjoyed the taco mix without all the extra hot ingredients it is yummy
4,it was a good recipe but wasnt a wow recipe we also added sour cream shredded cheddar crushed chips it was an easy recipe to throw together on a weeknight but not one i would choose over my normal chili dish or even our chicken enchilada soup staple
4,for those who need low sodium i make my own mixes and just leave out the salt they work very well in most recipes
4,we always used the beef or onion flavored ricearoni mix the sauce packet and water and cook the meatballs covered according to the box directions will have to try the tomatobased version soon thanks for the memory
4,we were disappointed after all of the great reviews for this recipe the only changes made were to add tsp minced garlic and use less sodium chicken broth this was just okay for us perhaps we prefer beef chili instead
4,these are very good and excellent to make ahead and freeze one reviewer said not to add the water to the meatballs but to put it in the sauce this is incorrect there are two different water measurements and the first one goes in the meatballs which is needed moisture for the rice
4,i made some adjustments firstly i cut the recipe in half i cooked the potatoes and carrots in three cups water three cubes of chicken bouillon stained the broth to use it in the roux i used three cups of chicken broth cups milk and between cups heavy cream the sauce was perfect with the extra liquid my husband and i absolutely loved it
4,stars very good and easy to fix
4,easy and tasty
4,used johnsonville hot italian sausage and closer to oz spinach all three of my kids said theyd have liked it to have had more tortellini overall very good though
4,wasnt sure about the recipe when i started out with the first few ingredients but loved the end result i used whole grain tortellini and added some fresh tomato i let the first ingredients simmer for about hour before i added the rest
4,the day i made it i wasnt terribly impressed but it was better the next day it gave the flavors time to marry
4,i really like the flavors of this soup this is the ideal soup to pair with a salad and breadsticks
4,a bit too much spinach for my husband and me i think i will substitute some zucchini next time other than that it was easy to prepare and tasty to eat leftovers were even better
4,i liked this soup i made a couple of small changes i did not add the water and im glad that i did i used a lowsodium organic chicken broth i also added about tbsp of tomato paste i used hot turkey sausage so i didnt need the red pepper i love basil but i chose thyme and oregano as my seasoningthis recipe came together fast and it is very good thanks
4,fast and delicious
4,please review ingredient list it says a small package of lime jello ounces i think thats a mistake our small packages are ounces not so i used the complete packageand it tasted delicious note i did not use reduced fat ingredients
4,this was very good i used regular lime gelatin not sugarfree since the sugarfree gelatins always take forever to dissolve completely the pie was very tasty and looked cool and lovely i brought it to a club meeting and it disappeared almost immediately
4,i have this recipe and it called for instant rice not long grain rice it cooked perfectly each time
4,this was a good recipe different from one my mom made but better i omitted the brown sugar because i thought it would be too sweet i noticed some comments indicating that the water made meatballs too mushy the water isnt supposed to be added to the meat mixture but with the sauce after the meatballs have been browned
4,all my family love these porcupine meatballs actually ive never seen them published anywhere came from an old edition of better homes and gardens cookbook betty
4,been making these for years from a recipe of my moms it can be much simpler than this mix ground beef salt pepper and rice to bind mix and shape into golf ball size balls put porcupine balls into deep casserole dish mix or cans of tomato soup and a can of tomato sauce with enough water in a separate bowl to make sauce cover the balls pour sauce over the balls cover and bake at check after an hour or minutes be sure to get the porcupine balls covered in the sauce since this is what cooks the rice if they are not covered the rice will be hard and crispy if you like it a little spicy add some tobasco sauce siracha or cayenne
4,my mother made these using a can of tomato soup for the sauce ive made it with green pepper plus onion and an egg
4,very similar to recipe from wwii using the rice to stretch the scarce meat
4,the sauce is thick and very tasty the only negative i have is that as others mentioned the rice was not fully tender even after cooking longer than called for next time i make these and we definitely liked them enough to make again i will either try minute rice or else use precooked regular rice i got one and a half inch meatballs from a pound of ground beef
4,very good i doubled the recipe and will finely dice the onion next time my yr old son loved them
4,we like this recipe as its very tasty and different i added diced celery and bell pepper since i was out of the green chilis and added an extra can of beans my husband really liked it
4,i have been working on adjusting a similar recipe for years and for my tribe here are the only changes i make on the cups of milk make half of this liquid whole milk and the other half and half or if you have heavy whipping creme us it this makes a huge difference and might create the need to cut back on flour as this gets really thick fast next is while the sauce is simmering throw in two slices of american or velveeta cheese last but not least is two to three cloves of garlic pressed put this in during sauce thickening i sent this home with my daughter and her husband ate almost a full half pie at a sitting he is skinny as a rail and eats like a bird but he said this was one of the best dishes he has ever had he would not say that for fun its goooouooood also i substitute shrimp for the chicken some times and make shrimp pot pie ummmmmmmmmmmmmmm gary
4,i make a similar soup but also add zucchini yellow squash and carrots
4,my boyfriend is a trainer and picky eater this fit the bill for us both
4,new family favorite instead of water add more chicken broth instead of diced tomatoes add diced tomatoes with green chili rotel works well wonderful with fresh bread
4,yummy doesnt freeze well with the tortellini in it
4,turkey italian sausage is very bland so i added some fennel seed anise seed and oregano very good especially with my husbands homemade italian bread i think next time i will use regular italian sausage for better flavor
4,this is a hearty and wonderfully flavored soup i used spicy italian sausage added chopped green pepper a couple chopped carrots and a cup of corn and some extra broth delish
4,this turned out well
4,i too make mini meatloaves but i use a small corn bread loaf pan to form them spray the m ini pan an d pack with the meatloaf mixture shake out into the baking pan continue withe the balance of the mixture
4,i have froze these before they thaw in microwave or gravy on stove top or in oven
4,this was very tasty the meatloaf i usually make is very similar to this except without the cheese so it wasnt a stretch to think my family would like this recipe especially my year old of course this is definitely a winner
4,this was very tasty my meatloaf recipe is very similar to this except without the added cheese so it wasnt a stretch to think my family would like this recipe especially my year old its a winner
4,this is very tasty my meatloaf is similar to this except without the cheese so it wasnt a stretch to think my family would like this especially my year old its a winner
4,needed a little more seasoning added some garlic yum
4,pthis is nice and wonderfulp
4,i used extra lean ground beef and it was rather greasy we didnt taste any cheddar cheese in the meat loaf so im thinking the melting cheese added to the grease in the pan we liked the ketchup mixture but will cut back on the brown sugar next time since it was a little too sweet for our taste
4,i loved this recipe because it was fast and easy tasted amazing this is a great meal to make if you have a busy schedule my husband loved it and wants me to make it again very soon
4,what kind of potatoes
4,had no issue with flour as others have had it was the perfect consistency very tasty teenage daughter said it was the bombthe prep work took a lot longer than min as recipe stated
4,i would use the potato and carrot water and less flour and milk the starch from the water will help to thicken the sauce and add flavor
4,my year old helped me make these so she could take a treat to daycare they were a big hit they never knew that they were eating their vegetables great recipe
4,very yummy and the frosting is fabu
4,very yummy my mom always made these growing up the only problem i have with the recipe is theres too much milk and makes the mixture too soupy i put cup or less and it comes out much better texture the original recipe form taste of home cookbook calls for ounce can of evaporated milk i need to try that
4,these were delicious cut back on milk and brown sugar as i dont like them too sweet they can also be frozen
4,very tasty we loved the sauce this is a little different than my usual meatloaf recipe and i think my family actually liked this one better
4,made as one whole meatloaf after all meatloaf is supposed to be easy loved the sauce very good also made with leftover rice next time because i needed to use it worked out fine
4,so good and easy to make i have made them several times because i can use gluten free oatmeal we have celiacs in the family i doubled the recipe but made a single recipe of the sauce i like the flavor of the meatloaf to shine through
4,what a great recipe for family fare been meaning to try these for some time and today amidst everyones middecember runningaround i discovered some plans had changed and i needed to provide a last minute supper whilst still running errands i found i had all the ingredients and they came together and cooked speedily i made exactly to recipe and they tasted great this must rank as a toh classic thanks for sharing and for keeping available for decades for us to enjoy
4,i cannot see the recipe because of the advertisement covering it i only see the partial ingredients egglands best takes up a huge square over the ingredients
4,omg its looking so tasty
4,pretty good i didnt add any brown sugar or onions because i didnt have any and i had to use bread crumbs instead of oats but it was still great
4,these little meatloaves are tender and tasty the sauce is sweet which my kids love i do wish i could have tasted the cheddar because i love cheese
4,i thought it was very good just a little too sweet so im making it again and cutting down on the brown sugar
4,an easy to fix favorite with great flavor usually have all the ingredients in the pantry so its a good quick and easy workday meal at our house
4,these were really good they turned out much more spikey and porcupinelooking than the picture shows
4,we made this tonight following the recipe basically word for word i simply doubled the ingredients because i just couldnt see pound of hamburger filling up three people we used white instant rice for the recipe and it worked great in my opiniontwo adults and our year old daughter she ate five of the twenty meatballs that i was able to make for the pounds of burger i browned in olive oil on medium high heat and basically just browned both sides because the skillet was a little crowded i removed the browned meatballs to a plate while i disposed of the grease from the pan i also rinsed the pan with hot water once the grease was gone i returned the meatballs to the pan and covered with the sauce x recipe for mesimmered on a low bubble for minutes turning the meatballs a couple times they were just great i couldnt believe my daughter ate five of the twenty i made my only suggestion is to take the time to make the meatballs evenly sized and to be sure and mix the ingredients thoroughly before turning into meatballs i suppose the only thing i changed was that i mixed only cup of water to the ground beef and added two eggs in the sauce i did not add the water at all just the two oz cans of tomato sauce tsp of worchestershire sauce and tbsp of brown sugar of the meatballs were eaten only due to stomach capacity of satisfied kansans we will make this more often so easy
4,sorry about the long review i need to stop drinking before posting use tsp of worcestershire sauce not tbsp and after i returned the meatballs to the pan and covered with sauce i also put a lid over my pan while it simmered in the sauce
4,these are good after reading the reviews i decided to double the sauce i had only one can of tomato sauce so i used that and one can of petite cut tomatoes i omitted the water since the canned tomatoes have a lot of water in them it turned out great my husband loved them and i usually dont get good reviews for my meatballs
4,this was a delicious recipe i used soy milk instead of normal milk and it was a good substitution i also used canned peaches instead of fresh or frozen and it was still delicious though i would say to reduce the amount of water in the topping by about cup and honestly i might suggest doing that anyways it was a lot of liquid leftover
4,the directions do not include the use of the half and half cream should it be included in the sauce
4,this was very good i forgot to put the sour cream and whipping cream in stiil good
4,dilogsdon the cream is an additional topping that you put on when your ready to eat it as much or as little or none as you want
4,this was quite good i used one g bag cups of frozen peaches thawed we did find it a bit too crusty for us but tasty nonetheless
4,very good but the icing makes this cupcake complete
4,turned out great the frosting turned out more like an icing for me either way it was delicious had a maple taste to it
4,i made these today my husband and son said these are execelent they we easy to make i added about cup more zucchini cooked only for about min the frosting is really good but hard time getting it the consistancy i wanted but u should try them theyre greatttttt u wont be disappointed
4,this was a nice treat the frosting is very sweet but my family loved it i think they tasted much better the second day as the flavors seemed to blend more and the intensity of the frosting seemed to mellow a bit
4,the cupcakes were moist amp were liked by the crew of volunteers at the food pantry i did not like the frosting much too sweet so instead frosted them with cream cheese frosting
4,very good recipe the frosting is a little time consuming next time i will just use a quick cream cheese frosting to cut back on time a little
4,easy to make frosting took a while because of letting it cool but well worth the effort
4,i made these for a sale at work they loved them rondha sullivan
4,mine were a bit dry even though i didnt drain my zucchini good flavor great frosting leave the frosting get to room temp before adding confectioners sugar and you wont have any problems with the consistency
4,my frosting did not turn out like the picture but the cupcakes were great i love the oj and extract in them
4,i thought this was very good the only issue i have is the amount of thyme listed in the recipe i didnt even use full tsp and it was still very overpowering next time ill use tsp if any at all i also made it in a x baking dish instead of two round pies which worked very well would definitely recommend just use less thyme
4,delicious
4,we tried this recently as i have a surplus of zucchini my boys loved them i had no problem with the frosting as is make sure you let it actually get down to lukewarm if you are having problems with the consistency setting it in a pan of cool water can speed the process i baked mine for min for the first then the second as i found them a little dry
4,i love how versatile zucchini is these cupcakes are so moist and a great way to use up all those zucchini you have growing in the garden kids will love them too and a great way for picky eaters to more veggies karen wise volunteer field editor
4,a great fall treat
4,loved the frosting cupcakes were a little dry and i only baked them min would try next time
4,i made these gluten free and sugar free still very good
4,only made the muffins without the icing as i dont like caramel but nice and light and moist a good recipe to exchange the zucchini for carrots but my zucchini was ripe the carrots arent yet next time
4,i was a little dissapointed cupcakes turned out on the dry side perhaps the bake time should be reduced will not make again i will stick to my no fail zucchini bread
4,very good but the frosting was a little tricky kinda came out a little runny but not bad
4,i used applesauce rather than oil next time i make them i will use half oilhalf applesauce to remedy their dryness at the edges they stuck to the baking papers
4,very tasty
4,amazing frosting was very sweet i added the entire c of powdered sugar and i wish i would have added a little less but these were fantastic
4,for those that had an overwhelming thyme taste use dried thyme leaves not ground thyme fresh thyme works best in my opinion especially if you can find lemon thyme it is easy to grow too best in x x inches deep pots and potting soil use started small plants rather than seeds so easy and cheaper in the long runi like to add the juice of one lemon in this as well the only way to make this even better is to have some homemade stock on hand i save and freeze all chicken bones in a bag in freezer
4,okay did not have everything and needed something quicker but used as a starting point made half the recipe and wanted to reduce time by dicing up cup of small new potatoes from a can for starters added about a cup of fresh mushrooms diced up along with onions to saute in butter substituted oz package of mixed veggies for all other veggies will use more next time used overflowing cups of rotisserie chicken along with jell from drippings in container mixed everything together along with cup of sour cream and placed in x casserole dish and topped with parmesan cheese and then small cutouts from pie crust oh used thyme leaves and it was all wonderful i will definitely be making this again and probably in the very near future
4,very good my first attempt using fresh peaches found it a little difficult slicing the peaches off the pit
4,very simple and easy to bake
4,it was good
4,i just finished eating small bowls fresh out of the oven and my oh my was it tasty although i didnt follow the recipe to a t i had to use bread flour because i was out of allpurpose crazy i know i also used brown sugar instead of white i used fresh peaches peeledsliced and added cup of fresh blueberries upon reading the reviews i decided to go with my own topping recipe i used a half stick of butter cup packed brown sugar cinnamon nutmeg and a splash of milk it made a saucy caramel i drizzled half of it over the batter and baked it at for appx min until the top was browned and i could stick a toothpick in and not have any batter on it very very good
4,really good but really sweet bars should be cut very small
4,good but real sweet cut into small sections a little goes a long ways came back to give more stars it grew on me and i was sad it was gone im making more i did not like that it was sticky did not come out like a hard bar but was tasty
4,my husband and i loved it and i would make it again for us but the kids did not care for it too many beans for their taste i followed another reviewers suggestion to cook it in the crockpot on low and stirred in the sour cream and cream about minutes before serving
4,cups of flour would have been way too much i stopped at just over cups plenty
4,reserving judgement until the boss weighs in
4,really needs to have weights for salt sugar and flour tasty recipe though
4,excellent recipe i did sub nutmeg for cloves and baked in greased floured tiny cupcake pancame out perfect at minutesa keeper
4,i have made this recipe a few times now and it has become my go to recipe i generally always end up using a mixture of whole wheat and regular all purpose flour and it turns out great i use this recipe not only for bread but also for homemade calzones and stromboli it really is a great all purpose bread dough
4,my bread didnt rise i followed to the tee
4,the zucchini muffins were okay however it was some of the best icing i have ever tasted the icing was beyond amazing
4,great frosting to use on other cupcakes and cakes
4,gt i totally loved these cute cupcakes but i turned them n holiday breads i used the zucchini crushed pineapple raisins amp either chopped walnuts or pecans salted wow they were so good i made and all of them got sold at the christmas craft festival this year i will make these again both as cupcakes and breads
4,really yummy cupcakes i would make these again i liked the flavor of the frosting but it didnt set up very well maybe it was soft because my butter wasnt cold enough the cupcakes are delicious without frosting
4,yummy very easy too
4,what can i substitute for the orange juice
4,this was very good i only used half of the thyme and made my own crust delicious i used low sodium broth and no added salt
4,they were good i like cloves but dont love them if i did these might get stars
4,thanks
4,omg i made this bread for my fist time to make bread and it was ausome thank you for letting me use the recipe ill use it many more times thanks again d from texas
4,old yeast isnt necessarily dead ive used rapid rise yeast thats close to months beyond the expiration date and it worked perfectly however if the yeast was stored in a warm area either in your home or in a warehouse somewhere along the line that could kill it long before the expiration date dissolving it in water thats too hot will do it in too best to have the water to if you set it out to rise is in a cold room that will prevent any rising i warm the oven a bit before i start and turn it off after a minute or so when its around that seems to work well for rising if the dough doesnt rise even after its set in the oven to bake then the yeast was dead
4,i keep yeast in the freezer and use as needed im using yeast from my freezer now that is over five years old still very active
4,really yummy and easy to make id recommend halving the salt though
4,i love how easy it is to follow too bad i didnt follow it i forgot to put the oil in didnt even clue in until i was reviewing cook times we shall see i will rereview once ive tried it
4,very easy i think theres a bit too much sugar though it could do with maybe one tablespoon less
4,turned out really good i shouldve formed mine better i just dumped it in there so the top was a bit funky d i did halve this recipe my first attempt at making bread and it makes me want to try other recipes really tasty im glad it was a success
4,ive made this recipe twice now both times as freezer meals for expecting mamas if you dont like the way the filling tastes after youve added broth and milk add spices salt pepper sage garlic onion etc note this recipe makes a lot of filling so use a large saucepan with high sides to cook and have three pie shells ready just in case this recipe always turns into three pot pies for me
4,this soup is good and easy to make i did make a few changesi used leftover chicken cans beans a little extra water to simmer in and i left out the cream because i didnt want it any thinner i would use milk to thin if needed it was yummy and easy
4,i made them but i think i cooked them to long they are good and we can eat them but minutes is not long enough to cook them and minutes is to long i will try again fancybetty
4,i love horseradish but family doesnt i mixed c horseradish sauce with c mayo i think it needs horseradish i put horseradish on the table and we who loves it added more i dont prefer the sweet hawaiian rolls but i did use them as they are the rage and seems everyone loves them
4,i read the reviews and decided to go easy on the horseradish sauce as well i added more to my serving because as the saying goes you can always add more but you cant take it out this was as easy to make as presented i did separate my portions in the baking pan which added a couple minutes only and this make serving easier the sandwiches baked up warm and tasty i gave it stars because my husband found the sweetsavory too sweet i will definitely make again but use less brown sugar
4,made this for the superbowl party while the flavor is delicious they were sort of messy to eat they weret a huge hit but they were tasty
4,this was good but would have been better without the horse radish i would try mayo next time
4,these sandwiches were a hit at our family gathering the buns ended up a bit soggy though i will try again
4,made these for sunday breakfast and i was disappointed that they needed to chill once assembled my fault so we saved these for monday morning i like the fact that you take them from ther refrigerator and pop them into the oveni thought the sauce was a bit too sweet kinda like the sweet ketchup sauce one would would put on a meatloaf all the flavors came through wonderfully next time i will cut the sugar to tablespoon and carmalize the onions prior to adding other ingredients a keeper recipe for a quick flavorful breakfast if you plan ahead
4,we love this recipe any one i make this for loves it and asks for it i would give it stars but for one thing as delicious as it is i think it is much improved with the addition of some cilantro
4,i loved this recipe however cut the salt and pepper in half or at least i did otherwise it would be too saltyalso i have an electric oven and at degrees it only took mins to bake the amt of thyme was fine my husband loved it and had two helpings i didnt think it was too thick at all it was perfect because you added a lot of liquid ingredients milk and chicken broth and butteri didnt rate it a only because the salt and pepper was way too much definitely have to cut it in half otherwise it was excellent bon appetit
4,good quality recipe and bread thank you
4,am i understanding that i am supposed to let the dough rise twice as the directions say in step and also in step so far this has been a very simple and easy recipe to follow for this first time bread baker
4,bread tastes really good and it was fairly simple to make but it crumbles a bit and was hard to make into sliced bread it didnt rise as well as i would have liked
4,new at this homemade bread thing enjoying it very much but this recipe has been the best by far texture was awesome best that ive made i save this recipe on my phone instead of trying to find it again and plenty of thumbs up from everyone
4,good basic white bread i bake a lot of fancy breads and thought i would give this a go and it came out fine i also made it out of a pan and just did two free standing loaves it had a nice crust and the bread itself had a nice sopping up power with my tomato based sauce it was a little heavier than store bought mass produced halfbaked store bought garbage but that is obviously to be expected we went through both in less than days id make it again for those having issues following directions is key use bread flour be patient put away your bread machine temp your water let the starter work dont use too much flouronly what it needs you probably wont need all cups if this isnt taking you a good hours to make youre doing it wrong
4,i made this bread different times once i didnt realize that my yeast was no longer active and ended up with a very dose loaf but my kids still loved it even i did then i made the second round with an active yeast and it was much better my youngest while having his first couple bites send to me mom this is the best bread seriously oh my gosh you should be a chef hahahaha i totally took credit too lol thanks for this easy recipe definitely a winner around my place
4,recipe reads simple the recipe is easy to understand does the recipe go well with a bread machine
4,i am a baker by trade but when im home i like to use this very simple recipe i do use an egg wash and i reccomend a very light sprinkling of flakey salt it is delicious and beautiful
4,bread turned out great could i use honey to sweetin and result
4,i love this bread eady to make and wonderful
4,too spicy for my taste i should have left out the cayenne pepper otherwise really good flavor
4,we are a garlic family so this was a great recipe for us my kids had seconds so this momma was thrilled the meat was fork tender and the sauce was a nice mix of sweet and savory between the sugar and the soy sauce would make again plenty for meals this this family of
4,next time a little less sugar and more cornstarch
4,very good family enjoyed it but suggest just a tad of heat added and only cook for hours thanks
4,one of my goto recipes easy to prepare and so good on rice i can never quite get the cornstarch exactly right to thicken the sauce so i end up adding more than the recipe calls for to get it thick enough really just wind up eyeballing it
4,my hubby hates chinese food which he considers dishes like this but he really loved the flavor the chicken had and we ate up all the leftovers
4,this was good not amazing but solid
4,i used boneless chicken breasts for this good taste and easy to make just dont over cook it like i did
4,so easy to make love to serve with rice
4,my dh loved this i did too but i think hours was too long or where i bought the thighs i used brown sugar and after tasting the sauce i thought it missed some brightness i had an orange that im using in a marinade later in the week so i grated the rind into it glad i did it really made a subtle difference
4,this recipe is really yummy i substituted water chestnuts for the celery and it adds a nice crunch to the soup i definitely added the hot sauce and i thought it would have tasted bland without it also nice to have a cream soup without cream rather healthy
4,i made this delicious but gets dry pretty fast and crumbles i will try adding an extra tbls of oil
4,delicious but part of one loaf was kind of doughy could be my oven its new and we have yet to figure it out
4,so this is a great recipe for ingredients but terrible directions and video i used the recipe as stated except i didnt need quite as much flour but followed mixing kneading rising and shaping instructions from youtuber bake with jack seriously do yourself a favor and watch his yeasted bread tutorial then make this following his directions you wont regret it ive made bread before but its never turned out as good as after i used his instructions with this recipe the combo will reward you with amazing delicious bread every time happy baking
4,yum great chicken pot pie recipe made my own homemade crust recipe on allrecipes great consistency would add a little more spices
4,tasty based on the other reviews used less flour and increased the spices a little
4,easy and yummy my son and i really liked it but it didnt win over my husband who doesnt care for cauliflower most of the time
4,good stuff even people who are afraid to eat cauliflower will like this if they have guts
4,very hearty chunky soup i made it as stated but used a cup of veggie stock and added a half onion it came out very thick had to add a little extra milk its a great and easy recipe but as others have said bland i added extra salt but still kind of lacked something and i didnt want to be pouring the salt in still great and i cant wait to make again with some herbs and with broccoli too thanks
4,i tried this recipe for the first time today have to say that there seemed to be toolittle seasoning involved so i used my go to combo of onion powder white pepper and sea salt i literally use these seasonings in every savory dish also added parsley and basil flakes i didnt have shredded cheddar so i used six cheese italian shredded cheese that i did have this soup will move into my personal line up the hubby is the soup king here but this one is mine we both loved it
4,i have made this soup twice now love the flavours i do find that it is a bit thin for a creamy soup i tried pureeing some of the cauliflower and adding it back in but i think next time i make it i will try reducing the amount of water used to cook the vegetables overall a yummy soup recipe
4,this was very good and very easy i added frozen peas i had on hand after tasting it and that made it even better i also thought it needed more salt and would like to try it with garlic like others have said next time i make it but over all very good my husband even liked it but he said could we add some bacon hes a meat person
4,tasty but a bit bland i think that i would add some onion to this recipe
4,love the texture of this soup its rich thick and chunky most comforting i did make a few changes and exchanges i added garlic and onions i also replaced some of the water for white wine and right before serving added a pinch of nutmeg janietaste of home volunteer fe
4,i had a nice sized cauli which i prepared some skim milk some heavy cream but no other veggies so instead of celery and carrots i added a can of mixed veggies used cup milk and one of cream plus cup kraft shredded pepper jack it was a most delish soup and i will enjoy it often this winter the pepper jack was a real winner
4,i thought the flavor of this soup was very good i will make again but next time i will cut the water by cup i thought soup was too thin
4,good but a little bland as is i added sauteed onions and garlic with a splash of sherry and a pinch of nutmeg now excellent
4,im not sure how thick the soup is supposed to be but it does seem to be thin i added red onion kale and a pinch of cayenne pepperim taking it to work for a lunch hope everyone that tries it likes it
4,what happened to the bacon lol
4,what can you substitute for the bouillon cubes too much sodium for me could i use chicken or vegetable broth this sounds so good
4,i made this pot pie for dinner very good i cut the recipe i half came out great the next time i make it ill make a looser gravy since we like lots of gravy in ours
4,very good the only thing i would do differently would be to add a rd can of beans
4,really liked it very tasty i used two chicken breasts and two chicken thighs
4,this was great i dont care for salt but i used low sodium soy sauce and it was fine will definitly make it again
4,this was really good i made for a dear friend and she still raves about it
4,i made some tonight and when i got it out of the refrigerator to cut it my bottom was still a little creamy which i didnt use foil cause i cant stand foil it makes me cringe hopefully by in the morning it will harden up but it tastes really good
4,thank u for this fast easy delicious recipe i just added a lil vanilla
4,great flavor but not as thick as i would have like it but even my fussy eaters who were not looking forward to it liked it
4,ive been looking for a great chicken chili recipe this one doesnt quite fit the bill for my family although its good its just missing that something special maybe cilantro would make the difference
4,very easy to follow and truly fantastic go easy on the thyme maybe just bake the chicken with rosemary and thyme and not stick it directly into the roux and dont dice the potatoes too small or they kind of turn into a mash when baked
4,i made this with almond milk
4,pretty good i doubled it and added chopped onion because a soup without onion seemed weird and extra cheese i also added some freshly grated parmesan and romano cheeses lawrys garlic salt and tony chacheres creole seasoning instead of the hot sauce i omitted the salt and pepper from the roux and added to taste after i combined the cheese sauce to the vegetables i wouldve gave it to a without my tweaks i will use this recipe again for broccoli cheese soup
4,i made a half recipe for taste testing and thought it was very good i will make it again but the half recipe only yielded cups of soup i did not see where anyone else questioned the quantity i track all the nutritional data in recipes and this makes it difficult to accept the portions and calorie count shown for the recipe i doublechecked the amount of the ingredients and found i was accurate with that anyone else find it does not make the quantity stated
4,made this last night very easy made it substituting cups of low sodium chicken broth for the water and bouillon and served it with hot pepper sauce on side a great basic recipe but definitely needed the hot pepper sauce as it was bland will make again but definitely with adjustments to up seasoning thanks debbie
4,i used ham pieces in broth that i simmered from leftover baked ham bone instead of a chicken base because i had it on hand we like cauliflower and ham so i thought it would be good it was
4,would like to make for concession stand food can i use biscuits instead
4,i made this for dinner tonight and everyone enjoyed it the sauce was so good what i liked most is that it didnt required canned soup i used my own chicken broth and next time i will make my own crust i prefer to cook from scratch and not used processed food so good and perfect for a chilly night
4,i dont have vegetable bullion how much vegetable broth should i use
4,i use a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket i make it without the green chilies so to give it more flavor i add concentrated chicken broth i use a little less sour cream and heavy cream like the others had suggested to make it thicker it freezes well
4,there is something wrong in this recipe no way would this be servings of cup each its maybe cups total and thats after i added additional tomato celery and a little extra pasta i dont know about you but my idea of a main dish salad like this with a pound of bacon in it would be more than cup so please investigate and fix this otherwise this had good flavor
4,has anyone tried this with fat free milk and reduced fat peanut butter
4,going to make it
4,since mayo is loaded with soy oil i use quite a bit less of it than this recipe calls for i use about cup and mix it with some sour cream i also use the spices to taste thats not nearly enough salt and pepper my mom always added a dash of nutmeg to her potato salad and i do too it adds just a little different flavor but dont use too much just a dash or two maybe equals about tsp or so i know a dash is different for everyone if im feeling lazy or dont have a lot of time i sometimes add the precooked bacon bits this is very similar to the kind we grew up with
4,tasted great next time i may add sweet corn
4,this was very good but i will add an extra can of beans next time
4,got good reviews but i wanted a little something more flavorwise i will tweak next time maybe it needs some bacon
4,i thought this was good i added about a half of a vidallia onion finely chopped to the dutch oven with a couple of tbls of butter and let that cook for a few minutes before adding the rest of the veggies i let the veggies cook for a few more minutes tossing them together and adding salt and pepper before adding chicken broth cups instead of water and omitting the boullion i then made the cheese sauce adding fresh nutmeg and then added the cheese sauce to the vegetables i did not add the hot sauce
4,just made this tasty soup with the addition of dijon mustard and a small potato very satisfying with warm crusty bread
4,good recipe you need to add onion to your ingredient list and sauté the vegetables in butter first and then follow the rest of your recipe as written also just a pinch of nutmeg will really enhance the flavour
4,i liked this recipe as is but i agree with a couple of the comments especially the one about the soup being bland as written so i made some slight modifications second time around which prospective cooks may want to consider i added a lot more carrots and celery around cup of each plus two large finely diced garlic cloves i found the carrots and cauliflower cooked much faster than the celery the first time i made it so next time i added the celery to the soup base minutes before adding the carrots and cauliflower i also added some cumin to the bechamel sauce i do like some kick to my soups so i added hot pepper sauce as directed the first time i used red pepper flakes second time as i thought the tabasco sauce turned the soup a bit too orange i like the suggestion to add some chopped onions as well i will try that next time just to keep tweaking the basic recipeas apparently that is what i do
4,great basic recipe i added teaspoons tuscan seasoning onion more celery more carrot minced garlic and more chopped celery yum
4,i love this recipe however to make it gluten free i do not add the milk butter or flour instead i just leave a couple of large pieces of cauliflower then when it is done i remove the large pieces and put them in the blender then add it back to the soup voila cream soup without the gluten i do add some salt and garlic as well i think it is delicious
4,i like this recipe i followed the recipe as stated except i added cups of vegetable broth instead of bouillon and cups of water the broth was pretty thin so i added additional tablespoons of flower mixed it with the broth and added back into the soup that thickened it up the taste was a little bland but still good next time i may add green chillies will make again
4,very good soup i added tsp nutmeg because thats what i doto cauliflower soup i also used store brand extra sharp cheddar cheese told once to always use extra sharp cheddar to get more taste for the buck
4,tasty comfort food substantial meal for a cold day my husband loved it the prep time is not accurate if you peal and cut your own potatoes onions and carrots count on prep time of at least hours if you buy a rotisserie chicken from costco or another store you need to buy two chickens for this recipe this recipe makes large pies its enough supposedly to feed people but realistically pies will feed about adults because you will eat more than an eighth of a pie we are average adults and the two of us ate a half of a pie its so heavy that you will not need anything else other than the pie for dinner the diced potatoes get lost in the pie maybe i should cut them in larger pieces next time this would be a great hit for a pot luck
4,this was pretty good my st attempt at making a chicken pot pie and it turned out it was very easy to make too so that was nice i will make a few changes next time and see how it goes ill probably do less thyme and will try homemade crust but all in allvery good recipe will be making again
4,i liked this recipe and would have given it a star rating but the meat sauce was too dry i added a cup of beef broth during the last half hour and it was fine
4,my picky husband rated this an out of and this says a lot based on the reviews i added a can of diced tomatoes with its juice it was perfect
4,did you know that you do not have to cook the lasagna noodles they turn out just fine
4,easy to fix the sauce had good flavor
4,im making it right now d
4,i followed recipe exactly and it was very good but i definitely will cut back on the garlic next time
4,good recipebut to saucy for me next time will cut sauce back
4,very very good i added half cream and half milk instead of just the milk a bit more pepper and used medium white cheddar and half a medium onion very very small chopped this is now one of my favorites thankyou jp
4,delicious a fair amount of prep work but the results are worth it thick creamy flavorful
4,this was really good love the bacon i think it would also be good if made with ranch dressing instead of the mayo mixture
4,i saw this same salad in the jewels food store deli bought a half pound figured out simple ingredients looked up recipe found this one only difference is they added cheddar cheese green and red pepper i added cup cesar dressing and little grlic powder yummmm
4,sounds good cant wait to make it
4,we thought this was very good although i dont know how it could possibly serve people with a pound of bacon i served it as a main dish and it served four with no seconds we do have big appetites though i added a little kraft zesty italian right before serving because it seemed a little dry
4,my family and i loved this salad but i did doctor it up quite a bit i decided to follow a few of the other reviewers suggestions for the dressing i used cup of ranch dressing one cup of mayo vinegar amp cajun seasoning i also poured bacon grease over the noodles i used the entire lb box of noodles i had a few items i needed to use up in the fridge so i added a partial red pepper amp green pepper in addition to the veggies listed in the recipe i put cup of gorgonzola cheese and it was a perfectly flavored salad to go with our bbq chicken we added a splash of italian dressing to the leftovers the next day and at it with grilled flank steak yum thank you all for your suggestions
4,this was very good but do make sure to season the macaroni with salt and pepper its just a tad too bland but with some added sampp good stuff
4,pretty good i made this for church gathering and everyone gobbled it up i added some extra mayonnaise and it need a little more kick so extra vinegar too
4,made this with tinkyada gf noodles very good
4,no matter what mac salad recipe i make my husband always rates it ok this salade he liked and even had seconds it seemed kind of blah so i added l cup of sweet pickles we thought it added alot
4,great recipeit does a wonderful job of disguising the healthy ingredients however it has way too much sugar in it for me i doubled the recipe to make it the same as my regular pancake recipemeaning it now calls for cup sugar my normal pancake recipe only has tablespoons of sugar for the same amount of flouroats because we use syrup on our pancakes i dont feel like i need my pancakes to be sweet tooits just added sugar that is unnecessary so next time i will reduce the amount of sugar to tablespoons and add teaspoon of vanilla otherwise its a delicious recipe also they brown quickly due to all the brown sugar in the recipe just turn down the heat so they cook a little more slowly and youll be fine
4,yummy
4,yummy i used frozen shredded zucchini and just drained the liquid i used ground turkey and red pepper and even my picky son liked it
4,we really enjoyed this i was concerned about putting a whole green pepper on top of the cheese so i put most of it in with the beef and onion to cook i also added some italian seasoning and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes
4,great i think you could use italian sausage or ground turkey and i would add more onions and more green peppers next time i will also use some reduced fat cheese to cut calories somewhat i also threw in somme fresh basil into the sauce and will add even more next time
4,dont you just love the smell of pomposity in the morning this recipe specifically states that it is american lasagna that differentiates it from italian lasagna but i have always found that rather than disparage a recipe because of your purist tastes or dismissing it out of hand try it different people like different things i quite like both this version and the ones made in italian kitchens you will find differences in recipes from your own mario and giada and im not sure i would rank either of them among the world class of chefs that you seem to suggest they are martin i would also note that some of the best cooking came from the kitchens of housewives unbelievable
4,real chefs will tell you to try their recipe and feel free to take the recipe and put your own spin on it using ingredients you like martin you are out of line with your criticism i have eaten a similar lasagna at the home of italian friends how many times have you heard real chefs say traditional recipes will be different depending on the region of italy it came from so why dont you learn to keep your opinions to yourself and comment on the recipe only if you made it seeing your displeasure with the ingredients i doubt thats going to happen so keep it to yourself love your comment bldrblue
4,i so love the substitution of cottage cheese i much prefer it to ricotta as i think ricotta tastes kind of dry great recipe
4,i cant wait for christmas i will surely prepare this lasagna for dinner with the use of bentilia to substitute the noddles used for healthier christmas eve dinner and of course to enjoy the dinner without hearing the kids complain
4,my first time making lasagna i followed the recipe except i used store bought spaghetti sauce my family really enjoyed this dish
4,this is a very good recipe but ive now made it several times with and without the sausage and we think its better without the sausage since its less greasy i just add a little of the traditional sausage spices to the grind beef and increase the ground beef lean proportionately we make it about nice a month these day sometimes more often in winter
4,made this for the first time tonight and loved it with a few changes made the meat my own way adding onions peppers and garlic to the meat and sausage mix and instead of tomato sauce and paste i used a large jar of my favorite spaghetti sauce which cut down the prep time the rest i followed exactly i let it rest for about hour before cutting into it and just reheated pieces in the microwave this was a real hit at my home and i had plenty left over for the next day definitely will be making this again and may try adding hard boiled eggs to the meat this time
4,i let my shredded amp salted zucchini sit for about minutes then squeezed as much of the liquid out as i could by handfuls since i felt i would be able to get more out that way after i pressed it into the dish i used several paper towels to soak up excess liquid after baking the zucchini was still a little liquidy but not bad im wondering how it would be with egg instead with the eggs it didnt seem to bind the zucchini in fact it seems the cheese would do a good enough jobi used spaghetti sauce and added a little more garlic and a very small sprinkling of oregano and basil
4,my son said that it tasted like my homemade pizza before he knew that there was zucchini in the crust my family liked it i will make it again
4,tasted great but was too mushy
4,awesome way to use up all that zucchini
4,was delicious mine came out a little soggy but perhaps i didnt get all the moisture out of the zucchini
4,very good my husband and toddler went back for seconds will try adding mushrooms to sauce next time
4,i cooked the green pepper with the beef and onion plus some garlic next time im not using any salt and i may try ground turkey
4,great recipe but for our family i will omit the thyme next time i did increase the broth by cup to make it creamier
4,i followed the amounts given and could have made pies next time i will not add the potatoes just a personal flavor choice and i suggest allowing the filling to cool before adding the top crust looking forward to trying this with other poultry and veggie combos
4,very tasty and filling great way to use up leftover chicken i used evaporated skim milk for the milk which gave it an extra creamy taste without adding any more fat and i used fresh thyme and a heavy sprinkle of poultry seasoning i made four deep dish individual pies and i could only eat half of one
4,my family did not care for it the first time i made it because of the thyme one whole pie went to waste made it again without the thyme loved it no leftovers this time loved the ease of the refrigerated pie crust
4,this was a great dish i didnt have any milk so i used cream of chicken instead it made the filling very think but it tasted fantastic
4,delicious and super easy to make
4,i cut in squares and took to a potluck it was a hit my changes were i used ground turkey and pork sausage had eggplant in garden so grated in with zucchini will make again
4,easy to fix and great taste i used pepperoni instead of ground beef to make more pizzalike family would have liked it more if had a firmer crust
4,this was a great recipe to use up zucchini i would make this again
4,i forgot to tell you that i added c quick oatmeal and c chopped walnuts to the reserved crust for the topping
4,my husband loved this dish and was happy that there were leftovers for his lunch the next day after reading other reviews i was very careful to make sure i really got the moisture out of the zucchini and was glad i had this came out great i will definitely be making again and may follow some of the suggestions for other toppings like pepperoni or maybe even using the sausage in place of the ground beef
4,this wasnt bad but i thought the green pepper overpowered everything and i like green pepper i used spaghetti sauce and added some garlic powder and fresh basal to the sauce i think i will try again but will put mushrooms and black olives on top and skip the green peppers definitely worth making again with some tweaking
4,my son didnt really like this but i did of course he doesnt like lasagna i cant explain it so that may be part of it but i liked the zucchinii might have to experiment with it a bit more
4,made this for dinner last night it wasnt bad but i wasnt blown away by it i didnt really taste the zucchini so it would be a good way to sneak some in on a veggie hater left off the green peppers amp topped mine with mushrooms amp black olives i will probably make it again but not often as there is a lot of cheese
4,i made this casserole just as wrtten and it was good the next time i made it i used italian sausage instead of the ground beef and it was fantastic
4,when i first mentioned this to dh his response was somewhat short of enthusiastic but his motto is ill try anything once he absolutely raved about this dish after reading many of the reviews i made sure that my zucchini was as dry as possible i didnt use salt but squeezed the shredded zucchini through some linen towels and then lit it sit for about a half hour then squeezed it through paper towels i really wanted a firm crust so baked it for minutes rather than that timing was absolutely perfect the edges were just starting to brown i added garlic red pepper flakes and some dried oregano to the sauce and sprinkled some fresh julienned basil on top of the casserole right before baking the ground beef was more prevalent a flavor than i had expected and the zucchinie was less this is a great casserole in which to hide vegetables wed love to try it with italian sausage instead of the ground beef but unfortunately that would raise the fat content through the roof all and all a yummy recipe
4,very good the process of drainig the zucchini was long i drained it for minutes squeezed it and drained again for minutes i then rolled it in a towel to make sure all the liquid was gone i used mild turkey sausage and added garlic and italian seasoning to the meat i will make this again but next time i will cook the zucchini longer until it is golden brown and starts to get crusty
4,good stuff things i did differently i sauteed fresh garlic clove and one finely chopped jalapeno upped more spices added a dash of cinnamon and shredded a preroasted chicken to save time i also added more cayenne pepper because it just wasnt spicy enough for me i also mashed up one can of the beans to help thicken it a bit and i used garlic salt instead of reg salt i added bacon crumbles and sharp cheddar this made it super flavorful and clearly not healthy at all but so good
4,i am not a fan of pancakes so used this to make waffles they were very good i loved the texture and hint of brown sugar taste great for a changei keep dried buttermilk on hand but after reading another review thought i would add that you can also use t vinegar plus enough milk to make cup as a buttermilk substitutei usually make a large batch of waffles then reheat in the toaster but for some reason these seemed a bit dry when i reheated them you probably would not have the same problem with pancakes
4,these were a total surprise to me when i read the ingredients it sounded like nothing i ever tried so i wanted to review it for sure i was expecting them to be really sweet but they werent at all the batter was much thicker than i am used to but that was just fine i didnt have whole wheat flour so i just used regular and i had no buttermilk so i used what i had in the fridge the only thing i would edit about the directions for this recipe is you should have a cooking temp on there because i didnt realize that they should be cooked at a lower temp because of how thick and it seems a few others had that issue as well if someone would like thinner pancakes they could easily just add more milk until the get the right consistency for them great recipe really nice job i will make it again for sure thanks for sharing
4,i liked these but mine came out kind of dry made the recipe exactly except i doubled it i may have put too much batter on the griddle for each one it was very thick so i should have added a little more buttermilk worth trying again though
4,i live alone made this recipe loved it much better than pancakes from a box mix loved that they told how to freeze soon as they cool they will go in freezer for a good quick breakfast on another morning
4,the recipe only made pancakes which was just right for people they were very filling they turned out a little dense and dry i recommend adding more liquid as some others have suggested not too sweet thankfully because they needed maple syrup for moisture i will probably look for another pancake recipe to try
4,these were good and i love the idea of putting oatmeal and whole wheat flour into pancakes to make them healthier and keep the kids fuller longer i thought the oatmeal seemed a little dry in them so next time i might add a little more milk and let them sit a few minutes before cooking them update i have found that if i let the batter sit for a few minutes before making them that the oatmeal is no longer dry in the pancakes and they are perfect also the leftovers make excellent sandwiches with ham and swiss cheese
4,i added a banana so tasty
4,i served a stack of the for dinner one evening i added a handful of blueberries to the batter my husband liked them for his dinner
4,added cinnamon amp nutmeg like others a little water because batter was so thick too but it is nice to eat a substantial pancake and not one that is tasteless have made it twice so hearty and good
4,very delicious tasted like doughnuts and were very sweet imwould modifynthe recipe to make it more diabetic friendly i added vanilla cinnamon and poudre douce which probably gave it moremof the dessert flavour no syrup required yummy
4,nice wholesome taste and texture but a little too sweet for my taste
4,if you puree i use my hand blender one can of the beans it becomes the thickener with no need for flour
4,this is a go to dish for me every summer especially with a garden full of fresh zucchini there is lots of flexibility with this recipe and you can add garlic to the ground beef and onion mixture and add in some italian seasoning to the sauce mixture i have done it both ways and our family loves it including my year old son
4,this aint pizza until you use a pizza crust so i did well sort of i placed a readymade roll out pie crust over the top increased the temp and saved some of the cheese to sprinkle on top for the last few minutes of baking
4,very good but add to your notes about crust z ucchini must be squeezed very wellusing several double layers of paper towels and repeat several timeseven after draining then crust should be kinda thin ish but even everywhere in pan or thicker parts do not crisp up well then be sure to cool crust completely so that meat
4,a great way to use zucchini really good tasting but our first question was where is the crust the casserole baked up nicely and looked good but we couldnt find a crust my family said i should add noodles i might add more flour i added cut up ham and black olives instead of the hamburger and peppers yummy flavor
4,good way to work some veggies into our diet
4,very tasty to those who thought it was too soggygoopy squeeze the zucchini in your fist to remove the extra liquid we loved this
4,i made this today and it was easy and delicious i will definitely make it again
4,very good and easy i used tofu for the hamburger
4,this dish was very tasty my husband loved the dish i added slices of pepperjack cheese to the topping will definitely make again
4,this is delicious but needs to be seasoned i added oregano basil salt and pepper i added a couple of cloves of garlic to the onionhamburger blend while browning my antizucchini family really enjoyed it
4,my picky family liked this recipe i made it as written except that i added minced garlic when browning the ground beef and also used pizza sauce instead of italian tomato sauce i may try some other options next time like adding mushrooms
4,these are a delicious alternative to regular pancakes i make them all the time
4,very good version of pancakes i have made these a couple times love themalso like to add some cinnamon and spices like that
4,very good but too many unnecessary ingredients ill continue using my moms recipeleftover oatmeal from breakfast an egg a little flour and enough milk to make a batter unbelievably light amp served with hot brown sugar syrup
4,i added cinnamon to these pancakes and they were yummy more filling than regular pancakeslexkygirl
4,i liked the lime flavor but expected more spiciness will try using hot salsa next time
4,good recipe but on day you need to serve the rest or freeze it chicken only tastes good for max of days
4,i had to make it faster so i eliminated the slow cooker amp used oz cans of chicken amp just warmed it up in microwave next time ill change chili powder amount by cutting in half very tasty
4,this was very good but a little runny maybe if i drained the salsa it would have been thicker also would swap out flour tortillas to corn
4,very good and easy
4,i made this recipe for a group of friends although i did exclude the italian dressing and cup of the salsa but it was a very big hit i made one casserole with lean ground beef and one with chicken i shredded and was suprised to find the chicken went over better with all the exact same ingredients it also cut very well after cooling with the excluded ingredients not messy or sloppy at all
4,the cumin was a bit overpowering for me but this is the first time i have ever used it my husband and his friend enjoyed it greatly
4,very good and easy had corn tortillas so i made layers
4,this is such a family favorite that i no longer need to read the recipe its a winner
4,pretty good nothing fancy but certainly tasty i think next time id go a little lighter on the cheese add some extra zucchinisquash and play around with some spices or a little more imaginative of a sauce also im having difficulty understanding where the similarity to pizza is imagined to be all that said i liked it plus as a concept ie squasheggcheese based its a great way to use up the tons of summer squash from the garden
4,we need a good substitute for the eggs thanks
4,i cant wait to try this love zucchini and pizza this was good i think ill use stewed tomatoes next time for more flavor
4,when i want to make chicken pot pie this is the recipe i turn to i have thought about reducing the butter a touch to cut down on the fatthats why i gave it stars instead of it seems like a bit too much butter in the filling
4,this potpie would have been delicious but i thought it had way too much thyme i will try again with only a smidgeon of thyme
4,this was pretty good a great way to use up zucchini as there is always an abundance this time of year i did use italian sausage because that is what i had on hand ill definitely make again but think i will bake the zucchini crust a little longer so that it gets a little crispy
4,i really enjoyed this recipe my husband told me to remember this one
4,quick and easy makes for a wonderful weeknight dinner when you have kids with sporting events or other things going on i also like to add green chiles to spice it up a bit
4,okaythis wasnt my favorite recipe ever but it satisfied a major mexican food craving tonight i made it with corn tortillas and the flavor was good worth making i think id prefer even a bit more cheese next time gooey is good
4,easy and quick i think gr turkey could easily replace the beef easy stand by meal
4,i left out the beef and used straight beans it made a great meatless monday meal
4,i left out the beef and used straight beans it made a great meatless monday meal
4,ive made this twice now and will be making it again and again i use soft corn tortillas for a more authentic enchilada flavor and double the cheese the contrast of the cool lettuce tomato and cilantro topping is fantastic be sure to use a very sharp knife to cut the casserole as the bottom layer of tortillas can be a bit of a challenge to cut neatly
4,i love mexican dishes and it is often difficult to find ones that my wife will tolerate the cilantro and the subtle flavor of the dressing made this a meal that she will most likely let me make again a dollop of sour cream would have probably made it even better
4,mine didnt come out near as neat as the picture and the bottom tortillas didnt come out until i cleaned the pan but i will make this again in a wider dish with tortillas on the side
4,this recipe is delicious i always add a little extra lime juice and make sure you buy very goodflavorful salsa or this recipe does tend to come out bland which is why it got instead of stars my husband and i love these tacos with all the fixings
4,is pretty simple and tasty and inecpensive
4,i like this recipe a lotits so easy to makeand makes enough tasty leftovers for a few more meals
4,love them i always add a little extra chili powder and lime juice and i put them on hard taco shells or make the chicken for nachos family favorite
4,this is a quick amp tasty recipe not sure where the other readers saltiness was from unless it was from too salty a salsa or from the cheese as there is no added salt here
4,this was so easy and good i used fresh limes there were on sale and definitely more then the recipe called for i also used about tsp of chili powder instead of the tblmy husband ate about of themand he is a fussy eater
4,pturned out fabulously i loved how easy the chicken was to shred up i was a bit concerned when i started to make it thinking the lime and chili seasoning wasnt enough and the recipe would burn but it didnt and made its own juices with it the only suggestion i have is to heat it longer than mins the finished product made a lot was a bit drippy but was still very good had plenty leftover meat mixture and used it for lunch the following date and crushed up some organic blue tortilla chips and mixed in with it super yummy that way too overall happy with this and would make it again since my picky family really enjoyed itp
4,very good flavor and super easy to make great for those days you just want to have super ready when you get home from work
4,i make lots of slow cooker meals and this was a great change from the ordinary stews etc i followed the recipe exactly and we all enjoyed it
4,this was just ok it wasnt bad but i thought it was missing something corn cilantro not sure what i gave it stars because of the ease of the recipe not sure how this recipe wins cookoffs though
4,i havent tried the recipe yet but it looks delicious i just wanted to make a comment in response to the information you shared about stock vs broth im not sure what youve shared is accurate its my understanding that both stock and broth are made from the bones the difference is in the length of time they are cooked bone broth is cooked longer with the intention of leeching more nutrients from the bones chicken stock is more for flavour where as broth is more for health benefits im open to being challenged on this just wanted to put forth a different perspective thanks
4,this was delicious and so quick and easy to make with simple ingredients this is a keeper
4,this recipe tasted great it was also really easy to make i did use cups of the cheese instead of because it just didnt seem like enough even though that added a lot more calories next time i might try saving the sour cream out and putting it on top
4,good recipe and easy to make next time i will try throwing some jalapeños on top as well since we love spicy food
4,we liked it
4,turned out really well it is a wonderful dish
4,im giving stars only because my bottom tortilla got too crispy to cut which made it messy i also substituted pintos for the black beans great flavor but may try cutting tortillas into strips as ceannze mentioned
4,ive made this twice the first time i added the italian dressing and it was terrible tonight i omitted the dressing and although it was much better it was missing a little kick next time ill try hot salsa to see if that helps
4,next time ill leave out the italian dressing it gave it a sweetness that i felt was out of place and ill use more beef and less onion between the salsa and the whole onion it was just about too much but in general a good recipe
4,this recipe is really good i changed it up a bit i used ground venison and made my own italian dressing i also doubled the recipe and used one can of black beans and one can of refried beans i disagree with most of the people on here about this recipe being fast and easy i started it at and by the time i was done with all the chopping it was definitely a weekend meal
4,i thought the flavor was good but it didnt end up looking like the picture the next time i make it i will add more layers of tortillas so it has more consistency overall a good filling meal
4,this is an excellent recipe especially if youre a beginner it tastes way better than buying them ready made i would however suggest only making this if youre used to spicy food because the amount of chili in this recipe is far more than regular taste buds can handle so if youre thinking about following this recipe you should half the amount of chili you use but for the rest this recipe is perfect
4,my family gets excited when they know im making this im still working on modifications as i personally find it a bit bland but fresh thyme garlic powder and even tobasco as another poster mentioned make it a bit more interesting i just use lactose free milk and get the consistency i like white wine would be a nice addition stars for an excellent base recipe that needs modification
4,deliciousalso used dried porcini sherry nutmeg reg cream
4,needs to be a little bit thicker for my taste flavor great
4,cooked it by the recipe but i did add a little garlic powder as suggested by another review and i am so pleased with the outcome it is absolutely delish tho next time i am going to try adding some cooking sherry also as another reviewer didi love cooking sherry and i do believe it will be a wonderful addition to an already great recipe
4,this was a fast and easy recipe my grandson who hates mushrooms loves it he is years old he just pushed aside the mushrooms and ate the soup the base must be it i made it exactly how they said and it turned out great very pleased
4,this was very good and easy i did add a bit of sherry thyme and a bit of tarragon just because i love tarragon i had some heavy cream i needed to use so did substitute that for the half and half hubby loved the soup and i will definitely make it again im sure the soup will be excellent without the heavy cream and following the recipe as submitted thanks for an easy quick recipe
4,so i read the reviews before making this i have never made white chili before but we tend to like our soups more like stew and our chili super thick so after the chicken onions and garlic i used fresh garlic were cooked i added two tbsp of flour and all the seasonings to the pot stirred it in to coat the meat and let it cook for a couple minutes then i added the broth chiles and three cans of beans finally i replaced the sour cream and whipping cream with cream cheese so yummy
4,this was simple and easy to fix my whole family loved it i will be making this a lot thanks for a great recipe
4,were not great fans of beans so i put a small can of corn and a grated zucchini in the ground beef mixture instead i didnt use the italian dressing and i used my own version of taco seasoning with garlic powder sweet smoked paprika and ground cayenne pepper i served lettuce tomato and chopped onions salsa and plain yogurt on the side makes it easier to reheat leftovers we all really enjoyed it
4,since its the first time i made this i followed directions exactly as written made no modifications it was good but the italian dressing clashed with the rest of the flavors and i didnt care for that bit will make again and omit dressing
4,i used corn tortillas instead of flour omitted the italian dressing i also added a can of refried beans and stirred the sour cream in meatbean mixture
4,ive made this twice i think i used corn tortillas the first time and liked it better than with flour i used about cups of cheese instead of just cup and my family thought it needed more cheese next time i will use less cumin and will leave out the italian dressing someone mentioned layers of tortillas im pretty sure its just layers i placed tortilla in the middle and tore the others to make them fit i ended up only using tortillas
4,this had good flavor but using flour tortillas made the layers too thick and hard to cut and eat if i make it again i will use corn tortillas
4,bottom layer hard to cut thru overall good flavor
4,i omit the italian salad dressing extra salsa used used a can of refried beans as well as the black beans good chance to get the extra vegetablesfiber my family needs
4,we liked this and i did leave out the italian dressing becsuse i could not think of a reason for putting those flavors in a tex mex dish also used refreid beans and pepper jack cheese instead of the mexican blend
4,enjoyed this very much i left out the italian dressing i just forgot it i think and used small corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas i thought it came out a bit dry so i might add more salsa or some enchilada sauce next time the whole family scarfed it down
4,delish added retried beans no italian seasoning even my kids loved it will make again
4,apple pie is my husbands favourite but i rarely make it yesterday i picked up a pack tenderflake crust and made this for him it went over well i did omit the ginger preference but next time id reduce the nutmeg a bit tooi found it a bit too sweet but that may have been because i used gala apples and they were quite sweet id like to try it with granny smith next time
4,overall i like the recipe like others i think either a little extra flower or some cornstarch would be good to help soak up some of the juices that might vary based on the top of applemy crust turned out great but even with extra minutes my apples still werent tender enough i used honeycrisp and a few golden delicious i wish now that id either tried another reviewers tip of covering the whole top with tin foil so i could have baked it longer or perhaps cooking the apples in a sauce pan for minutes to give them a head start ps i probably would have chosen jonathans or jonagolds if my store had them
4,good flavor but very runny
4,my suggestion to stop runny juicesprinkle tablespoons of instant tapioca put some on bottom crust some inbetween and finish with a little on top when juices are bubbling thru slits in top crust tapioca will thicken this as it cools delicious
4,great like it says its pretty runny but i just put it in the fridge overnight and it was perfect
4,i made this pie for my very first thanksgiving with the inlaws luckily i tried the recipe out a week before thanksgiving i made the first pie exactly like the recipe says to it turned out very runny but tasty nonetheless i then made another pie with the suggestions of other reviewers i upped the flour to tbsp and used a little more brown sugar than granulated i was also stumped on which apples to use so i went to my local market and grabbed of each they had i ended up with gala honeycrisp and sweet tango omg this pie was absolutely splendid thank you to everyone who submits a review so newbies like myself can bake something as easy as apple pie
4,easy to follow recipe very easy prep amp we baked a perfect home made apple pie the entire house smelled wonderful i highly recommend this recipe for the novice baker along with accomplished bakers as well we were very happy with the results we used a mixture of granny smith apples and fuji apples it was beautifuland tasted just as great highly recommend for anyone who wants to impress their family with a gorgeous homemade pie ps it was just as good cold the next day or even reheated in the microwave i felt proud of our efforts sincerely mrs vance
4,i never thought to put ginger in my apple pie pumpkin pie sure but never apple then this recipe came along and showed me another way its so yummy it seems like an insignificant amount but the ginger really adds some zing
4,all in all its a good pie the stars deceived me though its way way way too runny i should have read the reviews in addition checking the star rating so if youre getting ready to bake this pie do not dump the coated apples onto the pie crust under any circumstances unless you like apple pie soup
4,this was a great recipe and really easy to make i used granny smith apples it was a little sweet but by reading other reviews maybe i will add a little mor flour next time yum
4,i didnt have canned chicken broth so i used granulated broth too salty reduced salt liquid broth would have been preferable taste was excellant regardless
4,based on the other reviews i cooked the flour separately with butter as a roux it was still a bit too much flour in the final taste i also added some toasted onion powder that helped cover up the flour flavor ill definitely make this again but i think ill cut the flour in half
4,very good even i omitted the onion i used milk instead of cream and cans of chicken broth is just a bit tooo much and can is enough for me
4,this is an absolutely delicious recipe i actually tripled the recipe and added about cup grated parmesan cheese it was not as thick as i would have liked it to be and was more like a soup than a chili but nonetheless it was extremely flavorful and tasty i will definitely make this again
4,i lovelovelove white chicken chili and play around with recipes for it often this was good i did changeadd quite a bit but my favorite too to share is this i saw a lot of people thickening with flour and gagged a little lol as a southern cook my grandma taught me long ago to slowly sprinkle in instant mashed potatoe flakes to soups etc you dont taste the potato it thickens instantly and no lumps anyway heres my other many many tweaks i used a cold storebought chicken and sauteed a large chopped vidalia onion half of a chopped red bell pepper and added fresh minced garlic to the veggies once they were softened i didnt have green chiles so i added two drained cans of diced tomatoes with green chiles one mild and one mexican flavored yum also i had cans of canellini beans white kidney beans instead of great northern as far as spice i doubled or tripled the cumin we like that flavor a lot and added a few handfuls of chopped cilantro also i seasoned the sauteing veg mix with the yellow adobo and the sazon completa seasonings served this with chips monterey jack cheese guacamole and lots more fresh cilantro so good butsorry this was so long
4,i gave this stars because i followed this recipe to a t but omitting the sour cream and heavy whip i mashed can of beans to thicken the soul and added fresh garlic along with the powdered garlic i also added more seasoning to my taste of each i did add about cup of the shredded cheese to the soup as well i also added some frozen corn and cilantro to the soup as well as adding cilantro as a topping this soup was amazing
4,pretty good my family of four including one kid who does not like asian food really liked this i did not have sesame oil and i used more soy sauce and ground ginger than the recipe called for very flavorful we all added chinese mustard and more soy sauce when eating i will definitely make this recipe again but ill be buying preshredded cabbage to save time to make this a super quick and easy weeknight dinner
4,this was a great recipe i think next time i make it i will definitely add more meat spices and soy sauce this recipe is a keeper
4,this is my first time baking an apple pie and i used storebought crust i combined this recipe with a recipe from martha stewart and i used bits of both i had heard about cornstarch being a great thickener instead of flour and ive been experimenting with it lately its a great way to make sure it doesnt come out watery i used extra sugar and just under tablespoons of cornstarch i didnt even need to use the entire thing spices sea salt ginger nutmeg cinnamon white sugarand cornstarch mixture i noticed a lot of complaining in the comments about undercooked apples so i cooked everything together first and the cornstarch did its job to create a thick sauce right from the getgo it just finished baking so im at the cooling stage now i added milk cream and sugar to my egg wash and used it on the bottom crust to help keep it from being soggy as well as heating a baking sheet for it to cook on ill edit if i remember thanks for all the help from the comments
4,this was the second time i used this recipe thos time i used granny smiths rather than red delicious and the pie came out much better since it wasnt overly sweet the ginger also adds a nice touch
4,i left am earlier review and forgot to add that i halved the white and brown sugar my family and i have health issues so i had to tone the sugar down but it was soooooo good thanks for sharing
4,this apple pie is has amazing flavor the only reason i didnt give it stars was the fact it turned out a little soupy and the apples stayed really firm however because it tasted so good everyone loved it next time i make it im going to try cooking the apple mixture a little before putting it into pie shell to try to thicken it up a bit and soften apples a little this recipe is definitely a keeper
4,i have been making this exact pie for many years but in my recipe i have tsp cloves instead of ginger which i do prefer i like my pie mildly sweet so i only add cup each of the sugars i find the apples have a good amount of there own sugar even granny smiths i also blind bake my bottom crust i find the crust doesnt become soggy this way this is an excellent recipe thx maggie
4,excellent use for company
4,easy recipe while i loved the rice noodles family was not thrilled with them i loved the flavors
4,we really like egg rolls and chinese stir fry so this was a great combo of the two i used bagged cabbage and also we served over basmati rice instead of the noodles i dont like the consistency of rice noodles and we love rice ill definitely make this again
4,very tasty easy to make and good for you added some more pork and soy sauce but seasonings were perfect
4,a good taste but very dry ill try adding a little broth chicken or vegetable
4,made this exactly as called for and had a couple of problems first it would be way better to cook this in a wok rather than an ordinary skillet second it was extremely dry the addition of more soy sauce and more sesame oil about a tablespoon each was perfect will definitely make this again and perhaps try it without the protein at all very quick and easy recipe
4,i had chicken on hand and used this instead of pork mimicking the chicken egg roll i also used fresh ginger but felt it could use more seasonings i will pump up the seasonings next time and try with pork my husband and i like the dish it was easy fast and will probably make again for a quick meal
4,this was sooo good i pretty much followed the recipe except i did add red pepper and chinese spice i like spicy will definitely make this again
4,i made this the other night and wehubby and i like this a lot i did make one kinda big change i used one pkg of nissin chow mein noodle dinner since just two of us i used half of vegs but we like it wetter so used all sauce from recipe and what was in pkg too i have been working very hard to cut down to just servings find this brand has good sauce that works well with most noodle recipes i have given it just stars because of how much i had to adjust it i felt it would have been too bland without that change
4,easy and tasty
4,very good but i decreased the amount of seasoned salt to tsp the nd time i made them and the recipe turned out a lot better
4,was pretty good but small tart apples was awesome i love it
4,really yummy only complaint is that like other people the pie had soooo much liquid in the bottom no biggy though i just poured the liquid out carefully next time i would use more flower of cook the apples a bit first the taste is great though i used a bit less ginger just because i was afraid it would be too overpowering and it turned out good will make again
4,delicious i did add more soy sauce and added chinese hot mustard to spice it up a bit i made it with the rice noodles the first time but have since left them out and i prefer it with outi also have made it with ground chicken and its good too definitely recommend
4,great my husband and love it ive made it so far with chicken and with beef both just fine as with any recipe adding more soy sauce is your choice think about thisnormally you dip egg rolls into sauce they arent full of sauce to begin with
4,pretty good as is i did add more meat and doubled the seasonings our family thought it would be better with something with a crunch we tried sesame sticks which actually worked pretty well
4,this dish is wonderful my husband and i enjoyed it be careful not to over cook the noodles enjoy
4,this meal is awesome i make it once a month def a healthier version to springrolls
4,definitely love the concept but the flavor was not quite right needs a little more spice next time i make it and i will make again i will try some red pepper flakes to see if that helps thank your courtney for sharing your recipe
4,this is a very enjoyable recipie that is reminiscent of egg rolls without the rolling and frying it is a perfect recipe if a single person wants to bring an easy lunch with them for a few days and is balanced with veggies and protein the only thing is that it feels like it is missing something egg rolls arent the most flavorful to begin with and i dont know if for my taste if more garlic ginger onion or soy sauce needs added nonetheless a very good and simple recipie for my cooking arsenal
4,looks like a good recipe for me to try for those who think something is missingi wonder if it isnt because egg rolls are usually served with a mustard or sweet sauce so perhaps some of one or the other might either be added or served on the side
4,i also decied that coleslaw was the way to go unfortunately the vietnamese egg rolls my sisterin law taught me how to make use a rice thread noodle so thats what i thought this recipe was calling for pretty sure theyre not the same still it has great flavor but i am also thinking maybe a side of fried wonton would make it a star
4,didnt taste much like an egg roll but did have really nice flavors i used the slaw mix as someone suggested this was easy to make for a week night meal not a lot of soy sauce so good on sodium will make again
4,not a bad recipe and very easy to make i couldnt find rice noodles so i used japanese wheat noodles if i make it again i would add more ginger and remove the turmeric my husband didnt care for it unfortunately
4,i m always afraid fresh strawberries contain too much liquid instead of chopping them would it be wiser to smash them or put for a short pulse in a blender
4,i add creme cheese and more creme i also roast my chicken breasts in the oven and then pull and dice the meat i have won chili cookoffs with my version
4,i make mine just like this but use cream cheese instead of butter in the frosting
4,this cake was very good but very sweet i do have one suggestion do not make the icing until you are ready to ice the cake i made mine ahead of time then the strawberries released there juices when i was ready to ice the icing was way too runny
4,i tried this recipe for the first time i used egg whites rather than the eggs i also baked this in greased and floured square pans for minutesi used a cake tester to determine whether the cakes were done id used tbsp of the cake mixture to mix in with the chopped strawberries instead of using a strawberry icing i used cups of confectioners sugar cup lemon juice bottled and the cup crushedstrawberries id pricked holes in each cake with a fork and then drizzled the glaze over each cake the cakes certainly are moist the feedback on this cake from other readers is also very helpful i think that if i made the icing again i will concentrate on that ive made cakes using jello and i often resort to making a lemon glaze or other citrustype glaze which runs down into the baked cake making it extra moist when i added the water in the amount specified i added it slowly to the batter delowenstein
4,because the cake mixes have reduced weights make an addition to bring the mix up to the old weight mix cups ap flour cup sugar tsps baking powder and tsp baking soda place mixture into a ziplock or jar when making a cake add t of the mixture to the box mix and proceed as needed store the rest of the mixture until you make another cake
5,this cake was delicious and so moist i didnt need all the sugar called for in the frosting so would recommend starting with cups and then add more ifas needed i somewhat pureed the strawberries used in the frosting as well it got rave reviews from my family so thank you for sharing this recipeits a definite keeper
5,pi received endless compliments on this cake i used firmer strawberries so the cake held up for several days and i added a thin layer of strawberry jam with the frosting between the layers i kept the cake in the refrigerator and it was real easy to cut my husband said its a keeper recipep
5,this strawberry cake has been a family favorite since have past it on to several family members through the years
5,this cake has a really good taste i made mine in a x pan so i did have to bake mins longer i also didnt need all the icing amp i only used c powdered sugar
5,my daughter and i have both requested it for our birthday mine is june so we used fresh strawberries cups anyone who doesnt like this cake is not a strawberry lover i didnt make the frosting whip cream and more strawberries on top is all it needed
5,this is the only birthday cake that my daughter has accepted since she was and she is in her s my mother made it for her the first time and we have kept the tradition going
5,if this cake is made rightyou will always receive rave reviews ive made this cake for years alternating a golden cake mix white cake mix it will fall if too much fluid is added via strawberries love it for those that change the ingredients and processwhy review herebegin a new recipe
5,this is a really good strawberry cake recipe we have liked this one as at least one of the best we have one comment and that is we use more strawberries than this one calls for its everyones taste buds
5,this is a delicious cake moist and very flavorful
5,my new favorite soup oh my so delicious
5,made according to directions delish
5,this is a fabulous recipe
5,fantastic but mild i added half a carolina reaper delish the hubby said he detested white chili as this was simmering hubby said boy that sure smells great when do we eat he asked me to make more to freeze for later lol
5,i made this alongside a traditional chili for a winter gathering and this chili stole the show i was expecting leftovers for additional meals during the week but nope no leftovers its mild but theres always ways to spice it up if thats your preference if youre thinking about it just do it its easy fast warming and delicious oh and might as well double it i did
5,this recipe was excellent i added the cream cheese and it was the perfect comfort food i usually make individual portions and freeze it but this was eaten everyday for days exceptional
5,best white chili recipe ive had i served it up with fritos sharp cheddar sour cream and chopped green onions delish
5,best and easiest white chili recipe
5,i make this a lot my kids and there friends come over and ask me to make this all the time
5,i absolutely love this recipe ive tweaked it quite a bit when i want a spicier chili i exchange the green chilis for canned diced jalapenos its so good that way i also add an extra oz can of green chilisdiced jalapenos to it every time i make it it does not double well but have made times the recipe and its great for extra large crowdsplenty of leftovers its a great snow day recipe ive made it times these past weeks
5,wow this recipe is excellent as written the only change i made was that i used a oz jar of great northern beans it tastes so good with just the right amount of heat
5,amazing my boyfriend loved it so much going to make it again this week
5,i have a very complicated white chicken chili recipe that i have made for years everyone raves over it i saw this recipe and thought id try it as an easy alternative for weeknights my husband likes this recipe better super easy and delicious i did cut back slightly on the crushed oregano and cayenne pepper otherwise i made it exactly as written
5,bush used to have a white chili bean and it made this recipe super simple ive written to them and asked them to please bring them back
5,i just made this too it is wonderful as for the frosting i wish i had made it thicker its a tad messy cutting into it i will take nopalitos suggestion and put it in the fridge
5,i made this recipe hundreds of times starting back in when it first appeared in the magazine and i was a newlywed my yearold likes it and my yearold just started to like it i just leave out the crushed red pepper flakes and i use red onion this recipe is in regular rotation in this house
5,i have made this dish twice a week and hubby loves it more than i do it isgoing to be a stable dish in myhouse now and i am never ever ordering fajita in resturants anymore it is so easy convinent and delicious dish thank you for the receipe
5,am try to make it
5,i have tried so many different fajita recipes and it seemed nothing was ever good enough this is the best recipe for fajitas so far and ive been looking a long time i didnt follow the directions exactly though i used chicken i had precooked dumped it into marinade for about min tops while i sliced veggies then i put the chicken in a hot skillet with all the marinade let it heat a min before tossing in all the peppers and onion then i cooked it all til my preferred doneness of veggies
5,i have been making these for a few years now and they are always a great meal you really dont need to change anything with this recipe just follow it and enjoy
5,love fajitas these hit the spot
5,these were very good and flavorful they are easy to make and a crowd pleaser
5,followed the recipe exactly and was delicious
5,we loves inmy family we use the seasongs for chicken tacos and nachos best ever
5,made exactly as written and they were some of the best fajitas ive ever made
5,just made these tonight made exactly as instructed except i didnt have oregano just italian seasoning mix so i used that they were excellent my husband said yum after first nite and proceeded to inhale of them definitely a make again and again
5,to cynthia below who cannot eat cooked bell pepper maybe some chopped pimentos they have that peppery taste actually in cherry pepper family but you can try the chopped ones in a jar just a thought and suggestion have not tried this recipe yet but plan on within next week recipe sound great
5,ive made this twice and it is very flavorfully perfect amount of heat as is for someone who likes spicyhot but tongue cant handle too much if you enjoy a good chicken fajita you should try
5,so good and very easy to make all i added was a couple of splashes of hot sauce
5,really liked this fajita recipe even the hubby liked it
5,this is delicious i also made it with shrimp and it was also very good
5,this was soooooo good surprisingly my hubs who doesnt care for fajitas had he said these were the best hes had my son loved them too thanks for sharing
5,wow this really is a star recipe i made these into fajita bowls with cauliflower rice and it was really phenomenal the chicken was so tender and the onions and peppers were delish definitely reccommend
5,so tasty this will be an often used recipe at our house
5,these fajitas were delicious i loved how the marinade formed a coating on the chicken also it was a beautiful day outside so i left the chicken whole when marinating then grilled it i will definitely make these again
5,delicious i only put my chicken in the marinade for an hour but still tasted amazing also i didnt have lemons so i used lime juice instead and nonetheless fajitas were amazing
5,this was delicious the fist time so i had to do it againthank you
5,this is amazingly good delicious i am the only female i doubled the recipe for the four men in the house i hardly had any left great recipe definitely a keeper lt
5,this made delicious fajitas loaded with flavor but still somehow pleasantly mild they were especially good with the sour cream my family loved this recipe definitely a keeper
5,these are especially good my husband doesnt normally like leftovers but he asked me if we had enough left for another meal the only thing i did differently was to add yellow amp orange sliced peppers to the red and green very good meal
5,so tasty even my wife who doesnt get excited about fajitas thought they were good i felt they could have used a lot more peppers and onions though next time ill probably use twice as much i also salted the peppers and onions while they sauteed
5,so tastyi love this recipe
5,when your three year old son who only eats chicken nuggets says this chicken is yummy mommy you know you have a winner this is a real delicious dish i make it often now because its also so simple great quick weekday meal
5,i made this and added shredded cabbage to the sauteed peppers and onions i did add extra onions and peppers i also added slightly more crushed red peppers we absolutely loved this recipe there is something about the lemon flavor that we liked the hub went for seconds and said you can make a lot
5,i was skeptical of this recipe but it was so flavorful and delicious a hit with even my picky year old i will for sure be making this again
5,successful weekday dinner super delicious and easy to make i would know i am not the best cook lol
5,super tasty i made a couple tweaks as i dont have a grill baked the chicken at in the oven for minutes keeps the chicken juicy inside but cripsy out so you can kind of get that grill feeling also served with homemade guac see my full version here
5,i just cooked this recipe to a tee for my cuban family and everybody loved it i doubled the portions of everything to make more for a big group of people and made a cilantro salsa to top it off with that just put the final touch on this restaurant quality recipe the only thing different was i let the chicken marinate overnight which was a good choice because the flavors infused into the chicken and i splashed lemon juice all over the final product to get it extra zest plus it just looks cool and like i know what im doing i dont im just good at following directions absolutely delicious this is now my go to fajita recipe
5,very good not salty and very good flavor everybody loved it i put everything into the electric skillet and marinaded the chicken over night
5,easy and delicious i can fix side dishes while this is baking awesome
5,excellent quick and easy to make
5,i made these last night and they were really good i chopped my chicken into chunks instead of strips so they are easier to eat i will make them again soon i made enough for leftovers for salads this week
5,this is the best fajita recipe ive found yet i prefer to sub lime juice in place of lemon juice and i let the chicken marinate for a couple of hours also i dump the chicken plus marinade into the skillet without discarding the sauce i love the inclusion of green onions in this recipe i usually serve it with homemade guacamole everyone wants seconds
5,best fajita recipe ever my husband who doesnt like too many vegetables in his dinner gobbled these up i usually double the recipe it reheats just fine
5,very good mexican flavored fajitas hubby son amp grandbaby loved them next time ill add black beans per hubbys request i did saute chicken in a tab spoon of butter amp used veg oil for marinade as well will defiantly be making again
5,this is a fab recipe i make the seasoning in large quantity and use tabs of it every time i make it that way it saves a lot of time
5,fantastic
5,had this tonight and the chicken was so tender and flavorful hubby and son loved this saying its restaurant quality a repeater for sure
5,these were great i doubled the recipe and good thing too i made three changes halved the cumin cooked the chicken along with the marinade would have been impossible to separate anyway and added extra salt i did include the crushed reds as recommended we didnt even eat them on tortillas saving carbs and they were still great
5,this was given a thumbs up by the whole family easy and delicious
5,i love chicken fajitas and this is definitely a keeper my mom who is loves it i marinate the chicken overnight and i wouldnt change a thing
5,quick and easy dinner my family always loves chicken fajitas and this recipe doesnt disappoint
5,saving this one although i only used the marinade this is a keeper i had roasted a whole chicken to use during the week i wanted to do some chicken tacos and wanted a superior flavoring for the meat i found this and it was perfect for what i wanted i mixed it up and let my chicken rest in this marinade for a bit and tossed it into the skillet to heat it up it came out soooo goooood i will be keeping this for sure thank you for sharing
5,this is the absolute best fajita i ever ate i like more veggies so ill add another pepper and some julienned onion the next time however it was totally wonderful just as written
5,this was very delicious i used organic chicken breast tenderloins
5,excellent recipe made as is except for using a bag of frozen bell peppers and onions definite keeper
5,my husband and i love this recipe better than fajitas from a mexican restaurant
5,i love this recipe i use frozen peppers and onions which makes it quick i also let them defrost and drain them so the dish is not watery i consider this a quick meal and so good
5,delish the whole family raved and the best part is it is such an easy meal to prepare i had a cooled roasted chicken i needed to use so i cut the breasts into thin slices one family member cannot have seasoned salt so i used garlic salt instead and eliminated the garlic powder i tossed the chicken with the marinade and let it sit for just a couple minutes while i sliced the peppers and onions i sauted the peppers and onions in one pan and heated the chicken in another since some family members dont prefer the peppers such a winner meal
5,i love fajitas and this recipe did not fail me delicious blend of spices my husband prefers shrimp so for his i used the same seasonings and just added frozen shrimp instead of chicken he said they were great
5,i made this for dinner tonight for company and it was a hit it goes really well with rice and refried beans super easy i also used olive oil instead of what the recipe initially called for i will be keeping this recipe for sure
5,this was so delicious and simple we like things spicy so i also sprinkled in some hot sauce and as i was sauting the meat i also sprinkled a few drops of liquid smoke yummy
5,this recipe is awesome as is my husband recommended broiling the chicken in our toaster oven to keep the meat tender minutes per side and while cooking the vegetables in the pan it came together very quickly and turned out great
5,i have made this recipe a few times now and it is definitely flavorful i make it exactly to the recipe and always refrigerate it overnight this recipe is a keeper thank you
5,my favorite chicken fajita recipe had this last night and for lunch today love it and so does my husband
5,my husband and i really enjoyed these i just usedthe regular onions and omitted the green onions
5,im a volunteer filed editor and i love testing out recipes the marinade in this recipe was just right we really enjoyed the flavours in this dish i cut everything up and let it sit while i got the kids from school it was nice to have the prep work done ahead of time as this allowed me to help the kids with homework right up till it was time to cook supper
5,this is an amazing fajita recipe we had them last night amp my whole family loved them i made the recipe exact including red pepper flakes except i did allow the chicken to marinate over night my family used to love the applebees sizzling fajita skillet amp they took it off the menui tried a couple copy cat recipes amp none were that close this is almost exactly like it amp my son asked how i got the recipe from them i will be making this very often amp am so glad this popped up in pinterest for me
5,outstanding followed recipe exactly except used a prechopped fajita veggie mix from the produce aisle could not have been quicker or easier thanks
5,we just finish dinner and i got nice complements about this fajitas i did it exactly as you say and they were amazing iserved some tortillas but also some boston lettuce leaves for those who i knew were going to have more than onedefinitely i will make them oftethanks so much
5,awesome good
5,fantastically delisious so very flavorful without the crazy spice will be making many times over thank you
5,this came out great but i cut down the cumin teaspoon and the same with the chili powder and added a little extra garlic and added onion powder teaspoon other than that the longer its marinated the better i marinated it for hours and used burrito tortillas also added rice really delicious people each had with the fixings everyone was satisfied
5,this came out great but i reduced the c umin teaspoon and the same with the chili powder and added a little extra garlic and added onion powder teaspoon other than that the longer its marinated the better i marinated it for hours and used burrito tortillas also added rice really delicious people each had with the fixings everyone was satisfied
5,made today but i didnt have the seasoned salt still came out amazing family loved it it is definitely a keeper and a recipe worth repeating several times per year i actually turned on the broiler at the end made up the fajitas by placing two tortillas on a sheet of aluminum foil and preparing two large fajitas to go under the broiler just until the cheese starts bubbling they added salsa and sour cream and wrapped them up sauteing the vegetables in the remaining liquid left from cooking chicken is important cooked until they appear burnt in spots incredible
5,deliciousdeliciousdelicious
5,excellent made homemade tortillas makes it even better
5,quick and easy ive made this recipe three times now my family loves it definitely a recipe i will be using over and over
5,the whole family loved it
5,delicious and flavorful i doubled the seasoning and used one whole each of red yellow and green bell pepper and one whole onion sliced not too thin just like they do at my favorite mexican restaurant i made spanish rice to go with our meal definitely a keeper
5,easy to prep make cook and oh so tasty
5,easy weeknight dinner
5,amazing fajita recipe ive never made them before and everyone raved the chicken comes so moist and tenderbetter than the restaurants the only change i made was i marinaded the chicken all day because i was at work and not the recommended hours the recipe suggested definitely a keeper
5,these are greatwe love them we used chicken once and then skirt steak the next time
5,i didnt use lemon or lime juice and side have seasoned salt i used adobo instead marinated my chicken tenderloins for about hours in the fridge used yellow amp red peppers and onions sauteed low and slow for about min served with sour cream avocado shredded cheese and refried beans delish super easy and a fast meal a yummy recipe
5,i made this last night and will def make it again i followed the recipe but added a little bit of cream cheese to the chicken once i put it back in the skillet and wow definitely a winner recipe thanks for sharing
5,i made this last night and it was excellent the hubby said it was better than any restaurant i made it as written except used olive oil lemon and lime juice and no red pepper flakes shouldve used them needed a little kick i charred up the peppers and onions in the broiler served with shredded mixed mexican cheeses and sour cream delish
5,absolutely outstanding these fajitas are better than the ones at my favorite mexican restaurant i made the following modifications tripled the bell pepperonion and added a coarselychopped tomato during the last few minutes of cooking the chicken i also used heaping measuring spoons of all the spices served with sour cream and guacamole salad there were no leftovers
5,i so agree with all the star ratings for this recipe it is truly wonderful the chicken is perfectly seasoned do not hesitate to try this recipe i will be making this one alot more often
5,like a dumb ass ive been using a store bought seasoning package when i came across this recipe n discovered that i have all these ingediants at home it is spectacular my picky kids ate ever morsal defanetly going to make this a regular dish
5,best fajita seasoning ever i always increase the veggies usually bell peppers and onionsi never get fajitas at restaurants now because theyre always so disappointing nothing is as flavorful as this recipe
5,fantastic will certainly make again and again
5,i have now made these twice and they are the best fajitas i have ever made but as some have commented much better after marinating for at least hours the longer the more flavorful better than most restaurants
5,first time making this dish without measuring just put it all together and it is awesome i will be making this over and over and over again easy to making not time consuming i love it i give it stars
5,i made this without letting the chicken marinate because i was in a hurry and it was awesome im sure it would be even better if it had time to marinate for a while i usually use store bought fajita seasoning but didnt have any so used this recipe the combination of seasonings was perfect and much better than what i have used from the store this recipe is a keeper
5,thank you for a delicious and wonderful recipe i followed the recipe to a tee but i allowed my chicken to marinate overnight i highly recommend doing so the chicken was moist and the flavors were times better then any fajita packet from the grocery store my yr old gobbled the chicken down and kept asking for more this will be in our weekly rotation please try this recipe and you wont be disappointed
5,hands down this is a great chicken fajita recipe ive tasted them before but never made them this is the first time i ever made chicken fajitaslets just say that this recipe is definitely being added to my recipe book the marinade is divine and packs a lot of flavor i didnt let it sit for hours it was late so i let it sit for an hour and a half tops that was all the time i needed it was delicious the marinade was so good that i could have eaten the chicken by itself ill will for sure be using this marinade for other recipes as well my husband and son loved it cant wait to share this with my sisters at service
5,this is a fantastic recipe its super easy and the result is delicious
5,my husband just asked that i cook more peppers and onions next time my teen boys and their friend ate it and loved it also amazing they loved the slight spice that was just the right level for them
5,quick and incredible awesome to have on hand will make over and over
5,tried this a few weeks ago and my family is asking me to make it again this recipe is super easy and very tasty it will be in our meal rotation often
5,i have this almost memorized because i make this all the time the first time i made it my boyfriend remarked if i ordered this at a restaurant i would be back the very next night i have made this at least times and it is always fantastic this recipe is simple enough to be quick and easy and yet involves enough flavor to make you feel like you are simply amazing in the kitchen i typically double the marinade while the chicken is marinating i chop vegetables i have been adding mushrooms lately and its a great addition i cook the veggies first be sure to add salt and pepper then i cook chicken after marinating for at least hour mix it all together and voila i love to cook all the time but this recipe has to be made regularly its just that good and dont skip the red pepper cleanup is also easy it only requires a cutting board and a pan
5,we all loved this recipe i used lime juice instead of lemon juice i have also used skirt steak instead of chicken i prefer the chicken but hubs liked the steak better both were very good its so delicious and easy that ive made it for friends many times one of our favorites
5,i have made this since it first appeared in and it is a keeper all family loves it even the most picky grandkids occasionally substitute lime juice for lemon just for a change but for the most part follow recipe exactly as written except for adding more veggies as one grandson cant get enough peppers and onions
5,we love to cook amp can be selective about spicesthis combination was excellent per our preference we used bonelessskinless chicken thighs we warmed our flour tortillas on a cast iron pan until right before they toast too much to fold adds another layer of yummy flavor good enough to make for company goes together fast my only change will be to double the veggies amp onion
5,this was wonderful both my husband and i loved this fajita seasoning the only change i made to the seasoning was to use lime juice instead of lemon juice as far as the rest goes make other or more vegetables as desired we often make fajitas so we already know we like to cook one full onion and one each of the following bell peppers red green and yellow
5,hadnt made fajitas before these were very good i thought it was a lot seasoning at first for the chicken but blended well together i did add tomatoes with jalapeos to the veggies for more flavor and my husband and i like things with a little heat i did not put taco sauce on the fajita as i thought it would overpower the flavors will definitely make these again
5,this will be my new go to for fajitas i used to make a seasoning that had corn starch in it and it much prefer this one i made as is but like someone elses post about lime juice as opposed to lemon juice ill give that a try next time
5,wow these fajitas got it going on easy to make flavor is spot on i did use lime juice instead of lemon these made it in my receipe rotation for sure
5,this was really good add some chopped coriander on top to garnish
5,this recipe was one of the top of and i heartily agree i have made it several times and it never fails my only substitution was lime juice for the lemon wonderful addition to my texmex repertoire
5,i added lbs top sirloin steak and doubled this recipe and it was amazing the marinade is what makes this recipe so delicious flavorful and juicy such a great recipe
5,i didnt have lemon juice so i used cut up pineapple pieces and squeezed them in the bag threw them out before cooking because i didnt want a too tropical flavor but next time might just cook it that way didnt taste the pineapple at all i used small breasts was delicious and one of my best meals ever
5,i made this for dinner for my mother and me i ate it without the cheese or tortilla it was delicious i marinated the onions and peppers separately i am not sure i needed to do that but i like the added flavor i also used coconut cream for sour cream
5,delicious and quick if you prepare ingredients ahead of time husband says excellent taste of mexican
5,this is really amazing like made am account just to say this is good amazing additionally simple cheap and easy to modify
5,this is my st time submitting a review for an online recipe although i use them often this time i was compelled to create a user id so i could share how well these turned out i typically find online recipes too bland for my family this one was an exception although i did add a half tsp more of every spice in the recipe and more citrus and cilantro this is a very authentic at least na authentic dish tip marinate the chicken for as long as possible
5,delicious my family love it
5,my family loves these
5,love this receive ez
5,this recipe is easy and my family loves itit has become a favourite on the family menu
5,make sure you cut the chicken into thin strips to cook quicker and make making wraps easier we did not use any spice that had heat in it for people it produces at least different meals we put in a cut up tomato towards the end and it added great flavor
5,i thought i would try this for a quick and easy dinner and i am glad i did it was really flavorful i did squeeze a little lime juice on the finished fajita it just added a little extra zip
5,i love anything fajita this was enjoyed by all
5,i tried this and the fajitas were delicious
5,very good and easy to make i followed the directions except i used a frozen bag of peppers and onions so i didnt have the prep time these were great the next day too lots of flavor
5,everyone loved this recipe i think i could have used just tbsp of oil to fry the onions and peppers in though thanks for sharing
5,delicious sounding i cannot wait to make these
5,i love this recipe ive been cooking fajitas using this recipe for a while now the only thing i changed is using lime juice instead of lemon its also easier to add the dry seasonings to the bag before adding the juice and oil its less messy
5,made this for dinner terrific just as the recipe is listed i added some mushrooms outstanding
5,amazing better than any fajitas at a restaurant
5,my son with minimal cooking experience took the initiative to make supper one night lucky for us he found this recipe fantastic better than any fajitas i have ever had because he enjoys peppers he used a whole pepper red amp green rather than just half as suggested im am surprising him tomro just finished prep work and marinating in basement fridge only need fresh guacamole and a little cilantro and were set very happy daddy
5,i will be making these all the time now delicious
5,i made this for my picky nieces and they both loved it everyone else did too and it was so easy to make
5,this was absolutely delicious i used lime juice instead of lemon juice i marinated for hrs and the chicken was really tender when i threw it in the pan i know this should be common sense but be sure to mix the marinade up in the baggy before adding the chicken so it distributes evenly if you use hot mexican chili powder use far less than the recipe states super spicy i added mango slices to the pan toward the end of cooking time and added avocado and tomato on top of my tortilla mmmmm mango
5,absolutely delicious i made this for myself my hubby and our year old daughter and it was a hit i doubled the chicken and marinade and used whole green red and yellow bell peppers a quick simple and great meal
5,fabulous
5,very good recipe i cut the chicken in strips after its cooked
5,my family and i really enjoyed this fajita recipe delicious i didnt add the pepper flakes because my year old wouldnt eat it like that we also added black beans lettuce guacamole sour cream salsa and cheese to our fajitas
5,wonderful flavor only put in a pinch of pepper flakes because of little ones
5,fabulous recipe wished i could give it stars who needs packet fajita mix if you can make this this is a keeper in my recipe bookjulie thank you so much for sharing it with us all
5,this recipe may have just changed my life im going to make this time and time again something so easy to make should not taste this amazing the chicken has so much flavor
5,hey this is the best ive had my wife adores them and my kids love themi switched to lime juice instead of lemon juice before even starting it the lime is far more aromatic when cooking with a better flavor as well great recipe the chili powder and lime makes it
5,these have a perfect slice blend i never think ahead enough to marinate things i just cut partially thawed chicken breasts and let them sit in the sauce mix just for as long as it took me to chop the vegetables worked great i also agree that lime instead of lemon juice is a wonderful swap my husband loved these
5,these have a perfect spice blend i never think ahead enough to marinate things so i just cut partially thawed chicken breasts and let them sit in the sauce mix just for as long as it took me to chop the vegetables worked great i also agree that lime instead of lemon juice is a wonderful swap my husband loved these
5,very flavorful we enjoyed our dinner
5,love them
5,its easier to slice uncooked boneless chicken breasts if theyre partially frozen if fresh place in the freezer for about minutes before slicing the lime juice was an excellent idea
5,my husband and i love these fajitas the only changes i make are to double the onion and pepper because i thought it needed more vegetables the spice mixture is good but im going to try doubling it for the same amount of chicken today and see if it gives it a little more flavor quick easy and delicious especially with salsa and sour cream you wont be disappointed
5,i have made these before and they are a hit every time its a great idea for entertaining friend too its fun to have everyone create their own frajitas from a assortment of toppings dont forget the margaritas
5,i just made these for my family huge hit we even have one picky little eater in this family i doubled the veggies because the ratio between veggies and chicken tasted off making again tomorrow
5,great basic recipe that is easily adaptable to ones specific tastes be warned not to marinate too long with this recipe though the citric acid will eventually cook the chicken in fact this is how ceviche is made as for freezing the chickenyes it can be easier to cut partially frozen chicken however if you are having a hard time cutting unfrozen chicken the culprit is most likely a dull knife of course many of us freeze chicken but keep in mind that the process of freezing any meat will degrade the meat at least somewhat given a choice i would always choose never been frozen chicken and i certainly wouldnt freeze it just to make cutting it easier
5,these were really very good and so easy the only change i made was to add emerils southwest seasoning to taste to the veggies when sauting will make again the combination of seasonings in the marinade tasted like fajitas without a prepackaged mix
5,this was my first time making fajitas in a skillet since im so used to barbecuing everything on a grill outside but alas winter has started so i needed to find a good recipe after wasting my time and food trying other ones i found this recipe and decided to give it a shot everyone loved it including my and year old theirs didnt have any peppers though p i did use lime juice instead of lemon because of what i read on the comments section and it was awesome also i added a jalapeno to give it a little more kick for my hubby the only thing i would do different would be to only use half the serving amount of oregano lol but that is just a preference this recipe will be used again and again in my home
5,hello i did this for dinner tonight its was delicious

5,hands down the best fajitas ive ever had this recipe is a keeper
5,this recipe is my first attempt at fajitas and it was huge success as stated in all the other reviews they are as good and maybe better than restaurant fajitas my only advice is maybe err on the side of too narrow strips of chicken i thought i was getting them thin but not so they were still yummy just not traditional thin strips also may try in a cast iron skillet next time just because

5,outstandingas good or better than any restaurant fajitas easy to prepare
5,very good i marinated the meat for four hours and so and it turned out to be salty enough that it left no room for taco seasoning but we added some anyway so it was a little too salty next time i will add less cumin because and tsps was a little too strong
5,not sure quite traditional but excellent well be making this frequently

5,my entire family loved this recipe we all love peppers and chose to add or peppers rather than the pepper that is recommended we also prepared the peppers by roasting them in the oven first and then peeling them then added them to the onion mixture we also grilled the chicken so we did not cut the chicken into strips until after it was cooked

5,shamim shabbir kaniz fatema foods in app
5,was looking for something different to make when i ran across this fajita recipe sounded very good and after reading several reviews decided to try it i used less chicken than it called for i used yellow red and green bell peppers and cut the onion in larger pieces did not have cumin so put in cilantro tbsp of lemon and tbsp lime juice marinated for about hrs i love cooking in cast iron and i use a counter top hot place that i can adjust the temperature to precise numbers i used degrees the flavors were absolutely wonderful my husband said that was the best fajita he has ever had thanks for this fantastic recipe
5,awesome will be making again
5,my family and i loved this recipe the chicken was so flavorful and we will be making this again
5,this is the best chicken fajita recipe ive tried several but none are as good and simple as this my family loves them and now i make this meal at least once a week
5,best fajitas ive ever had sand so easy to make better than at a restaurant i plan on making these at least once a week
5,i am from south texas and this is the best fajita marinade i have ever made i highly recommend it as is we did dive the chicken and then cooked it on the stovetop in the marinade
5,like others i used t lemon juice and t lime juice just wondeting what people used for the seasoning salt
5,love this recipe very tasty
5,i am not what you would call a professional cook so making fajitas for the first time was nervewracking but following this recipe and tweaking it to my liking they were absolutely amazing even my mom enjoyed it and she absolutely despises onions they were x more delicious and flavourful than any fajita ive had at a mexican restaurant and a huge improvement compared to our local one personally i used more lemon juice and a little less cummin but since i like a little spice i used a garlic jalapeno and even fresh jalapeno slices to give it an extra zing fresh cilantro chopped up really gives it an extra oomph too ive made it twice now and both times its came out super delicious
5,very good i didnt add the red pepper flakes cause i dont have em but it was still delicious
5,awesome
5,i just add a little crushed red pepper flakes one red and one green pepper we love it
5,instead of using chicken for this recipe i used a butterball apple wood smoked turkey since it was fully cooked i kept the sauted peppers red amp yellow and onions in the pan and added the turkey to heat it up this was sooooo yummy
5,my husbands and i favorite dish this is definitely a keeper to pass down to my children
5,excellent flavor ive made this many times
5,this is one of my familys favorite dishes they taste great
5,this was so good the flavor was perfect i didnt have fresh peppers and onions so i used a frozen blend and they ended up pretty limp so i will use fresh next time but it still tasted great super quick and easy too
5,my boyfriend and i love this recipe its so easy to make and even if i forget to marinate the chicken the night before its unbelievably flavorful in just an hour two wonderful
5,my husband and i love this recipe i use more peppers red yellow and orange and onions the last time i made these my husband said that this is his favorite meal that i make he said he would love to have them once a week i usually serve spanish rice or refried beans with them great recipe julie
5,great recipe definitely a keeper
5,loved this recipe the only thing i did differently was double the marinade mix meat was tender and so flavorful
5,awesome recipe better then mexican restaurant chicken fajitas
5,i could not believe how good this was and its so easy i had all the spices in my pantry for the marinade and always have lemons on hand this is definitely a keeper ill even make this for company sometime too
5,i needed to use some golden delicious apples before they went bad never have attempted a homemade apple pie used this recipeoh my goodness i am hooked it is so good
5,i thought the presentation looked very delicious the ingredients are easy to use and find
5,i made it with store bought pie dough still was delicious and easy love it thank you
5,well if i want a sweeter pie i thought id use gala apples but my mom said that the texture is different and that gala apples would most likely fall apart so maybe in the future ill try that by the way love the recipe so good i used store bought so good but ill try homemade next time
5,delicious used large apples and doubled the sugarspice and it made regular size pies
5,perfect i baked it longer but may have had more filling
5,making this apple pie for the second time and i love it i live in yakima washington and its apple season here i usally dont bake but this was so easy to make and simple i did use a little bit more sugar than it asked for in the recipe
5,i had lots of apples left from a recent visit to a friends orchard so i decided to make a pie found this one through a google search and it looked good i used half ambrosia and half ginger gold apples i think granny smiths would have been better it was still very good just a little sweeter than i would have liked
5,perfection
5,really good pie filling recipe my first time making an apple pie i only had honeycrisp and golden delicious apples so i used those came out great i did cheat and use pillisbury refridgerated pie crusts i made it on wednesday night and didnt cutserver it until thursday thanksgiving day it was perfect
5,this recipe by far is out of this world my first time making apple pie i made it last night and it turned out so delicious we love love love it i did used variety apples as indicated from the helpful tips i added a little little more dough than requested by increasing by more since i love thick crust and for filling i have added teaspoon of allspice to give a unique taste baking time took longer for the extra thick crust by min thanks for sharing this recipe and the great tips very helpful
5,this apple pie is amazing i added other ingredients to it like coconut and it was so nice
5,pi made this last night for dinner and everyone really liked it i liked that it was so easy i didnt have lemon juice so i used lime instead i will make this again for surep
5,this recipe was great but spicey i will make this a lot but without the red pepper flakes even my kids loved this
5,i really enjoyed making this pie today it was sweet and spiced just right it made a hit with the family and was truly a snap to make i did cheat by using a good quality frozen crust i beat my egg white nicely and brushed a good bit all over the crust and then gave it a generous sprinkling of sugar my top crust was made by using a maple leaf cookie cutter stamp and just covering the entire top of the pie with leaves i just love how pretty it makes the pie just beautiful for fall this recipe is a keeper thank you
5,this was a great classic apple pie it did come out looking wet but you have to let fruit pies cool before you cut them i let mine cool overnight and it was perfect the next day no run off and no soggy bottom for those who say the apples werent tender you need to test the pie by sticking it with something to make sure they are soft before you take it out if your crust is getting too brown put on a pie shield or foil
5,i cant figure out why this is getting less than stars it was amazing not wet or runny at all i used a double crust store bought and granny smith apples i followed the recipe as written scratching my head about these other reviews it turned out fabulous
5,this is probably one of the easiest apple pie recipes ever i have been baking almost my entire life usually using my moms recipe after she passed away i was unable to replicate it but this is darn close i only use granny smith apples i use less sugar and brown sugar slightly less than half a cup per pie a bit more cinnamon about the same nutmeg and flour i skip the ginger as i dont think the pie needs it i dont care for a pie that is too sweet so i am pretty liberal with the lemon juice i might add a teaspoon more of flour depending on how crazy i went with the lemon juice i generally dont sugar the crust but that is my preference i made two apple and two pumpkin pies for thanksgiving this year and needless to say there were no leftovers to those that have a problem with the filling being too wet i suggest using extremely crisp granny smith apples the peel should be dark green if the texture of the apple is mealy it is over ripe and will probably be too wet thanks for this great recipe and the lovely memories it gave me of baking with my mom
5,i made this pie today and it is so good i didnt add ginger or nutmeg it wasnt soupy at all i think that comment was very nice at all thanks for the recipe
5,this is the th time i have made this piecomes out perfect every time
5,this filling added tablespoon brandy and teaspoon vanilla but did everything else as directed this filling recipe is our favorite coupled with a butter and sour cream crust delicious
5,best apple pie filling the apple slices were crisp not soggy the recipe was easy to follow and the advice was a plus my friends gave the pie filling rave reviews this will be the one i use for now on
5,i love this recipe the pie was delicious and its so easy i did use a ready made pie crust which worked out great
5,this was delicious and i even skipped the white sugar due to heath and latent food allergies i limit my sugar and i can not use sugar substitutes has anyone else ever altered the recipe i think i will try it without any sugar next time also can anyone recommend a tool that helps you figure out the nutrition value this way i can see the grams of sugar based on my alterations thanks again grandma knew what she was doing
5,made it as a tart using half a pie crust loved this so simple recipe
5,i only marinated for minutes and it turned out delicious next time will marinate longer i did add chicken broth to pan to cook a bit longer to make sure it was well done and it came out very moist cooked it till broth was cooked up and then added veggies to fry up chicken
5,i used the recipe as a starting point and it turned out incredible first i added teaspoon each of ground cayenne ground ancho chile and ground chipotle chile this gave it a deeper smokie chili flavor without adding much heat since a added more powders i also increased the oil to make it into a nice marinade paiste i pounded out the chicken breasts so they were equal in thickness and evenly spread the paiste over them when cooking the chicken i started with a very hot grill and cooked them for a minute and a half on each side removed them and let them rest of minutes this left the chicken with nice grill marks and raw in the center i then sliced them into even stips and finished the cooking with the vegatables by cooking the chicken twice i could control the timing of the fajitas for the party we were having
5,this is a solid marinade i added a tablespoon of vinegar and a teaspoon of cayenne pepper for some spice and it turned out awesome i marinated for hours it was a bit salty though so i might bring it down to teaspoon next time fyi
5,this was my st time cooking anything remotely mexican food i wanted to learn how to make this for a dinner date i done a test run and it turned out delicious i however didnt have time to marinate so i just slow cooked the chicken while letting it absorb the seasoning i also added barbecue sauce in i will definitely be making this again
5,prep time took me longer than minutes but it was completely worth the time
5,the more gem recipes ive located and made on taste of home the less and less ive been enticed into going out to eat i cant think of the last time i had fajitas out that could beat this recipe there is nothing difficult about this recipe and the flavors are huge in this one sometimes ive just used chicken tenders to save time but the only change ve ever made was to double the amount of bell peppers and chopped onions
5,my family loves when i make this for dinner the flavor is really good and i usually dont have time to marinate the chicken for no longer than min and it still comes out good im sure if i took the time to marinate it longer the flavors would be even better but im fine with how it turns out
5,extremely delicious satisfies my cravings for restaurant mexican food i think marinating with the lemon juice makes a big difference
5,excellent well rounded full flavored recipe split between both chicken and flank steak will definitely make again home run
5,ive made these fajitas several times and we just love them the only changes i make to this recipe are that i use lime rather than lemon juice and i use a little more red pepper flakes to add a little more heat i always make extra sometimes even doubling the recipe because we really like to eat it the next morning with eggs sometimes well mix the chicken onions and peppers with beaten up eggs in a skillet and just scramble it all together sometimes well just warm the chicken onions and peppers in a skillet and then serve it with an over easy egg or two right on top yum
5,the whole family loves this one i have made it using lemon juice in the marinade and like juice another time when we didnt have any lemons great both ways
5,very flavorful an easy make we really enjoyed it
5,made it tonight everyone enjoyed it i will definitely make this again
5,tasty
5,yummy
5,i have made this pie at least five times and each time i get rave reviews my grandmother and mother said its the best apple pie theyve ever had i do cook it a little longer to make certain the apples arent crunchy delicious
5,lovely recipe for those who had issues with soupy pie or apples that did not cook up try making sure that you are using a baking type apple as opposed to a snack variety they are not successfully exchanged
5,i did the recipe to the t because i saw a review complain that everyone tweaks the recipe and reviews their version rather than the original recipe and they are right so i followed the recipe exactly and it is absolutely delicious i will critique it though ginger was a little too strong especially paired with the nutmeg it truly over powered the cinnamon taste it definitely came out liquidy however i found when you let it cool for about mins the liquid becomes less runny i used a pillsbury pie crust phenomenal i did set up the pie crust and the sugar mixture first then sliced the apples up and mix together to avoid letting the apple pie filling become to watery didnt really change anything but the pie is truly delicious without adding or subtracting any ingredients
5,excellent recipe i added a few things and tweaked the sugars i also highly recommend using more than one type of apple for better flavor i use macs cortland and granny smith makes for great flavors
5,i made this pie last night and i have to say it is the best recipe i have ever tried it was delicious and will now be my new go to apple pie recipe
5,a doctor it up a little bit less sugar and a scoosh of nutmeg i bake and give away and im told this is the best apple pie ever
5,this is an amazing pie i actually didnt look at reviews before baking and actually kinda shocked to see them lol i did follow the recipe to a t yes i will admit the pie is a bit liquidy at first but after a half hour there was no more liquid pouring out taste wise its amazing you can taste everything perfectly maybe a little to much cinnamon but thats preference baking wise it did take a little bit longer than said but if you just keep your eye on it and put foil around places that are getting to brown itll come out beautifully either way would bake again saving the recipe
5,this was my first foray into baking an apple pie ive done lots of different cakes pies and cupcakes but ive been a limited intimidated with the apple pie well my son wanted an apple pie for his birthday and so it was the right time to just go for it i chose this recipe because it was simple and straightforward i did read through many of the reviews which are very mixedfrom best pie to worst pie honestly that made me a little nervous but i decided to remain positive and give it a shot the result was spectacular i had my son eat the first piece and he was incredibly happy he said it was the best pie he has ever had and went back for a nd even bigger slice i took the next slice and i was also impressed with just how good it tasted and how well everything came out i will note that i followed the directions without any changes i used only granny smith apples and i didnt have any issues with the filling becoming too liquidy or the apples not baking well enough the pies taste is amazing i thought the proportion of the spices was completely appropriate so no one spice stood out too harshly honestly the hardest part for me was making the crust which i also decided to do for the first time i was actually worried most about the double crust but it somehow all worked out phew i would definitely recommend this recipe its worth taking a chance
5,very quick and easy i usually use small apples to make inch pie crust
5,for those complaining about the juice that comes out of the pie right when you take it out thats normal you have to let it rest like the direcrions say so it can jellify so yes gavin you threw away a perfectly good pie dab
5,update to earlier post i did not use ginger nutmeg only bc none on hand still
5,laughing at all those who dont realize that you cannot cut into an apple pie thats fresh out of the oven great recipe
5,please be respectful and limit comments to only the recipe and advise others do not attack anothers character with with profanity baker keep in mind that many have never ever baked before
5,first time making homemade pie and its delicious very easy to followthank you
5,i made this pie last night followed the recipe exactly used gala apples and it came out perfect great pie
5,this pie was delicious after reading the reviews i decided to make the tablespoons of flour into heaping tablespoons and the pie turned out perfect will be making this one again
5,best apple pie i ever made i will say one thing i put heaping tablespoons of flour and it came out perfect after reading a review saying they heaped the flour i decided to do that it came out perfect thank you taste of home my family was so thrilled with my pie
5,im a year old baker and ive always wanted to make an apple pie but i always thought it was too hard i found this recipe and i was astonished by how easy it seemed this pie came out so well when i made it my whole family loved it so i already made it twice in the last week this apple pie recipe is so good and very simple to make i will definitely continue to make this pie for the rest of my life
5,this pie was delicious it was the first homemade pie i ever made but the recipe was easy it included items i usually already have in the kitchen and it didnt take much time to prep however i only had gala apples which made the pie perfectly sweet but not too sweet i didnt have any ginger so i missed out on that intended kick the recipe included the top layer of my crust was still raw after mins so i added more minutesit was then half undercooked so i added more minutes and adjusted to degrees maybe i had the pie on a rack too low in the oven all i know that in the end it was delicious
5,omg this was an amazing pie i have made so many things for my family and me and this was by far their favorite thing ive ever made i read the reviews before and used heaping tablespoons and it worked out great i didnt measure out my lemon juice i honestly just poured whatever the apples needed d i actually really liked a little bit of that lemon flavor i would recommend some more some cinnamon but i really love cinnamon so thats your choice lol i used a premade frozen pie crust and as you can see it worked out great ovbiously i had to buy some more to get the top covered i recommend to not be shy with the egg whites i brushed all the egg white on the top and im glad i did i thought about not using all of it but i did and got a great pie all in all this was the most awesome pie ever so glad i found this recipe lt
5,this is the first apple pie ive ever mad and is seriously one of the best apple pies ive ever tasted i followed the heaping tablespoon suggestion for the flour but all the other directions as is i believe ive made another dish better than my motherinlaw and shes been making her pie for well over years my husband was pleasantly surprised
5,i have been baking this recipe for years and love to experiment with a combination of different apples when available here in namibia the only time i have been disappointed is when i did not bake it long enough now i always check for the clear syrup to bubble out of the vent before removing from the oven great flavor and very easy to make
5,i think the recipe is delicious i noticed some of you found it soupy not that i am an expert but i think some apples have more juice in them then others maybe if you are using an extra juicy apple you will have to add a little more flour just a suggestion
5,second time makingfirst time too much liquidi used my canned applesdrained all juiceput extra cinnamonexcellent will continue using this simple recipe
5,outstanding used granny smith apples got rave reviews from all folks at the campground i didnt have nutmeg and forgot to add the butter oh well still awesome taste and texture the next day definitely a keeper to make again with homemade vanilla ice cream yummy
5,i have never baked a pie before but this came out amazing i didnt use any ginger and only used lbs of apples witch i recommend i also used macintosh apples they were a tad bit sour but over all it was very delicious
5,amazing
5,best apple pie ever
5,a classic treat followed the recipe exactly except for the egg wash and sugar on top of the crust at the end
5,these recipes look great its awesome to see so many delicious recipes in one place
5,best apple pie ive ever made and i have it on good authority two experts at eating apple pie a grandson and a neighbour
5,i have a ton of apples and decided to make apple pie ive always heard granny smith apples make the best pies it turns out its because tart apples have the most pectin and other apples can make your pie soupy lesson learned either use granny smith or allow apples to macerate and release juices prior to baking watery or not the pie was still delicious
5,this is by far the best apple pie i have ever made and eaten i think it is the brown sugar instead of all white sugar whatever it is it is fantastic
5,very good apple pie recipe i lost my cookbook that i had for years which contained my apple pie recipe i had an idea of all the ingredients i needed but wasnt quite sure on the measurements found your recipe and it was fabulous i love the use of all spices and the brown sugar thanks for sharing this recipe its already in my new cookbook ive started
5,so at first the pie was soupy when i took a slice but the flavors were amazing the pie sat in the fridge all last night and all day today it still looked soupy were the slice was taken i took another slice andno more soup this recipe is great thanks for sharing i wouldnt
5,this is a wonderful apple pie recipe best ive made ive seen some reference to the pie being soupy i didnt experience that at all we let the pie rest for a few hours after it came out of the oven it was perfect when we sliced and served a la mode of course
5,wonderful pie
5,this was a hit i left the sugar the same but used about cups of sliced appleswe like our pie deep dish
5,this recipe turned out great i just made it for thanksgiving i did add an extra tbsp of flour as other reviewers advised and the results were not runny at all or dry also for the sugar i let my half cups measures be slightly short and it didnt turn out too sweet also for the ginger instead of powder i used paste and slightly more since its fresh i used granny smith and honeycrisp apples the results were fabulous ive made apple pie in the past using recipes found here or there and the flavor was always missing something im not sure if it is the use of ginger or that i use ceylon cinnamon but this recipe is a keeper
5,best recipe ive used in a long time
5,made this for thanksgiving and it was a hit will be making for christmas
5,extremely tasty had some liquid inside but was delicious otherwise
5,best apple pie i have ever tasted just the right combination of ingredients i followed the recipe exactly as it was written and it was really excellent everyone i shared the pie with agreed it was the best i loved the story about your granny that was just the best i will forever think of her everytime i make this pie which will be often
5,very easy to make thank you
5,this is the perfect apple pie i used my own pie crust recipe though because it is tried and true two tips abou the pie filling i used a combination of jonagold and granny smith apples but increased the amount of apple to cups this was just right for the stated amount of sugar flour and seasoning juicy but not runny baking time needs to be increased substantially i started with the stated time but the pie was not nearly done baked another minutes checking frequently to be sure it was not over baking apples should be nice and oozy and very tender with these two minor modifications fabulous results
5,wow being a lover of apple piei was always intimidated to attempt to bake onewell i got brave tonight and i went for itthis is the best apple pie ive ever eaten in my lifeand i made iti love taste of homeive made some delicious meals from the recipesthis one ill be making for years to comeabsolutely delicious
5,delicious pie i used my favorite goto homemade pastry dough recipe for the crust i used granny smith apples and honeycrisp apples that combination was perfect for us just the right amount of tart and sweet tip for all if you dont want runny pies heres what to do mix your fruit with your sugars and lemon juice let sit for at least minutes dump the juices that have been rendered out into a small sauce pan boil it gently for about minutes to form a syrup you can add a teaspoon or so more of sugar at this point to thicken up your syrup if needed let it cool slightly then add it back to your fruit and sugar mix well then add your flour this works every single time with every kind of pie you will not have any more runny pie filling thanks for sharing this great recipe
5,no hassle apple pie recipe cooked to perfection
5,for a novice pie crafter i and my coworkers raved about this recipe easy and unnaturally deliciousi used granny smith breaburn and jonagolds for two pies just enough tart and sweet and bulk for pie filling ill keep this for other times when apple pies are called for
5,i made this pie today and it turned out very nice but next time ill skip the ginger about apples if you live in an area that has fresh picked apples you are very lucky apples after being stored lose moisture and this will cause your pie to be dry unless you add a little fluid or less flour used fresh picked granny smith and only honeycrisp because they were huge and so sweet and tart too all in all this year old man is glad he found this recipe
5,great recipe i used cups of apples and t of flour and it was perfect i used granny smith apples thanks for the recipe it is my new go to recipe for apple pie
5,fabulous and what a pie
5,its a good recipe i opted out the ginger just because im not much of a ginger fan i used granny smiths apple and honey crisp it was alittle too tarte next time ill use another honey crisp apple and less granny smiths wish i could add a picture
5,for a pie novice like me this was an easy recipe to put together the taste of apple mixture was good my problem was that the apples were a little too soft i cooked the pie the amount of time stated in the recipe maybe i sliced them too thin or i overcooked it how thick should the apples cut i used cups of granny smith apples i am a better cake baker but this was a marvelous start to perfect cannot wait to try it again my husband said it was good never the less
5,flavorful and delicious
5,best apple pie recipe that ive ever made everyone loved it
5,i love this pie and make it often ive found that thinner and consistent apple slices are best and you have to let it cool completely up to hours to avoid soupiness i also like to do an open weave with the top crust which may allow for extra evaporation lastly i cook it for about an hour total with foil without
5,the best apple pie i have ever eaten
5,every hood and tastu
5,i tripled the amount for a dinner party and only added lime zest to the marinade it was delicious
5,doubled had fajitas just had the perfect meat and peppers for lunch made enchiladas from leftovers and all were excellent
5,wow there was soo much flavor i cooked the chicken and veggies on the grill which i think added that great grilled flavor
5,love these easy to make fajitas ive made them a few times with an easy pico de gallo salsa over rice and they are awesome each timr
5,made this last night on top of the stove cooked chicken in the marinade without marinating it four hours and it still turned out delicious
5,absolutely delicious time was limited so we did not refrigerate the chicken in the marinade for hours as directed by the recipe we still found the chicken to be abundantly flavorful so much so that when making it again we will not marinate the chicken as it was absolutely delicious and obviously required less timeplanning ahead otherwise there is not a thing i would suggest differently i just wanted to point this out because often times the set in the refrigerater for x amount of hours deters one from choosing a particular recipe so i want to make it known that if youre looking for the best chicken fajitas but in a pinch for time that is not a reason to pass this one up highly recommend this was printed off and put into our family cook book as we will be making this often thank you for sharing
5,these were delicious my husband isnt usually a huge fan of fajitas he still didnt eat the onions or peppers but he ate tons of the chicken its a win in my book
5,i made these yesterday i cook for one me absolutely delicious you can trust the five stars on this one i only marinated the chicken for less than an hour and these were still delicious i would love to make again and marinate for the full hours i ate some with corn tortillas but ive decided im going to put this over rice tomorrow for a change yum
5,great recipe absolutely delicious
5,the marinade is what makes these fajitas extra special my husband asked me to make sure and save this recipe
5,my daughter
5,this is the best recipe i have found for chicken fajitas
5,super simple marinade makes for tasty home made fajiatas i cooked the chicken before the onions and peppers and left them all to warm up together and we really enjoyed our meal
5,excellent flavor will definitely make these again
5,made it just like the recipe its my favorite dinner on the quick
5,i couldnt find any egg whites or some of the other ingredients but it turned out perfect none the less i might be only but this was very simple and exciting it was the first thing id ever made on my own adding extra butter made it even better sometimes accidents make things better i used a wholly wholesome gluten free crust because i have celiac
5,i made it exactly as written it turned out excellent
5,only one thing i didnt go covet the pan first the sticks at the bottom
5,excellent flavorused granny smith applesthey are my favorite
5,this was the best apple pie i have ever tasted in my life i made it exactly as written so simple and nobody believed i made it thank goodness my daughter witnessed it thanks so much
5,awesome piereminds me of home in the fall playing outside as a kid down to my grandmothers smelling the pie mixed with the ocean breeze salt air spruce trees and a homemade apple piecannot beat them three smells together along with the waves crashing the beachahhhhh wish i was back home in maine
5,i wish there was a higher rating then five stars this was my first homemade apple pie and it came out the best ive had in my life and thats not just because i made it haha there were a few different changes i made and that is i used the homemade pie crust recipe off of crisco container i skipped the egg white and made a melted butter with sugar and cinnamon to brush on before baking i know its not the healthier choice but it added some great flavor to the crust i substituted the flour for tapioca because my grandmothers secret is it adds a little extra sweetness and flavor also i forgot to set the timer and didnt read the cover with foil part so i accidentally skipped out on that so it was uncovered for about minutes apples werent mushy but also not hard right in the middle i used janigolds and mitzu apples that we picked at the orchard
5,this is my go to apple pie recipe so easy and so delicious love it
5,wonderful recipe the only thing i did different was leave out all spices since i love the taste of only apples i also laid a piece of foil over entire pie first min then uncovered and finished baking min until apples are tender when pie poked with thin knife
5,very good just a bit too much nutmeg though since we dont really like it ill try cloves instead next time
5,fantastic pie i use tab cornstarch w tab flour i don t like nutmeg so i use all cinnamon
5,the best apple pie i have ever tasted my homemade crust was pretty good also
5,im not a usually a fan of pie but a lot of people in my family like it so i decided to make it i listened to the other reviewers and added an extra tbsp of flour and i added a little extra cinnamon because who doesnt like extra cinnamon anyway the pie came out perfect it had fantastic flavor and wasnt very runny
5,i used all granny smiths which weighed lbs the spices and sugar amounts were right on actually perfecto sliced apples real thin about inch or so increased flour to tblsps consistency of cooked mixture was very nice my supreme critic wifey said she would have used a couple of macs or fujis thought a couple of apple slices were a little hard though she gobbled it down first time for me with a two crust pie will add a fuji or two in the next attempt with this wonderful recipewhich will be soon with ice cream maybe perfect on its own i used a crust recipe listed on the net excellent and easy pie crust recipe
5,i never write reviews but this pie was awesome it was quick and easy to make and had the perfect combination of spices also for those of you who were wondering youd need about regular sized applesthe only thing i would change is the sugar it was a bit too much for my family i would cut one of the sugars in half also i did not listen others and increase the flour but it may have helped the runnyness it was not runny per say but could have used a bit of extra thickener lastly i made this in a regular round metal cake pan with the same cooking time and it worked out great thanks for a lovely recipei used criscos no fail pie crust recipe
5,this was my first apple pie ive ever made my family and i loved it great flavor wouldnt change anything its perfect
5,awesome tapioca to thwart the runs winner also no ginger dont like
5,wonderful i made this w my daughter it was simple to make and delicious to eat yum

5,i have found the apple pie recipe for keeps my husband and yearold son were drooling over this pie i used granny smith apples tablespoons of flour not one drippy run didnt have nutmeg butused a little pumpkin pie spice and cardamom in addition to cinnamonand ginger i used trader joes pie dough and im telling you it is utterlydelicious
5,i loved this recipe it was simple and just what i was looking for i loved the sugar on top of the crust i used pink lady apples the perfect combination of sweet and tart
5,this recipe is fantastic i would not however add much extra flour i took the advice of some previous reviews and used tbsp flour instead of the recommend tbsp and the pie filling was too sticky next time i will use and it should be perfect
5,great recipie

5,this is an amazing apple pie it is yummy and reheats very well a big hit at our new years eve party will repeat recipe for the next familyfriends event highly recommended

5,my first apple pie amp my lifelong recipe be sure to cool completely before slicing i used this filling in empanadas amp wontons too

5,i made this recipe for the first time on thanksgiving this year i had read through the reviews and i added tbs of flour to the dry mix after tossing the apples there was still some mixture left in the bowl which i proceeded to sprinkle evenly over the apples before placing top crust it came out great it was my first time making apple pie myself and this was as easy as can be i will definitely make this one again i did not find it too sweet at all but i will try different apples with it as the granny smiths i used were really tart the sweetness is a matter of taste thank you for sharing this recipe
5,i never made an apple pie before so this was my first attempt everybody loved it in fact ive made this times in just weeks
5,this is the first applie pie i have ever made and i recieved many compliments from iti did additional flour as the reviews had saidone family member actually said that it tasted just like grandmas pies used to that is the best compliment anyone could give me i will definatley make it again
5,this pie filling is the best i have ever hadand i didnt use a regular pie crusti used the pie crust from the dutch apple pie recipeto die for
5,made this recipe today to take to friends for dinner shes diabetic so swapped out the sugars for splendas amp added t of flour got thumbs up it set up beautifully everyone loved it better than my moms amp i didnt think that was possible definitely a keeper
5,made only one of these pies for thanksgiving i cut it into tiny slices so that none would be wasted by my grandchildren and greatgrandchildren only those who were at my house first got any my son who does not care for sweets ate about half of the pie his son who does not like apple pie ate two slices of it and loved it the rest of us got a sliver of it and wanted more i made it with splenda in place of the sugar as my husband and i are diabetic needless to say i am making at least three or four of these pies for christmas i am sure there will be none left over
5,this is the first apple pie i have made and it got rave reviews i went by the recipe using cups of apples i used half gala and half braeburn and sliced them pretty thin i found the pie to be a good consistency not runny at all even after cutting the filling does not run out in the empty area
5,very good first apple pie i madedefinately will make again
5,i also use the additional tablespoons of flour i also normally use two or three different kinds of apples this is by far our favorite recipe
5,truly delicious ive found my favourite pie recipe
5,so good and so easy my husband loves it so it is definitely a keeper i used green apples since that was what i had on hand and they were delicious
5,i add some oatmeal to absorb some of the juice
5,i maid this for my brother and sister in law but as i was putting it in i realizedthat i forgot the butterthey said that it was the best apple pie that they ever hadi still think that it could of used butter
5,i made the apple pie today came out ok i read the other reviews several cooks said they added additional flour to thicken the mixture i used granny smith apples so they dont produce a lot of juice so i didnt need the addition flour that is required in with more juicy apples i did find the pie was a bit too sweet my fault again i should have tasted my apples
5,i get asked for this recipe all the time
5,this turned out great family loved it and like another person i forgot the butter too it was still great with out it would be really good with homemade whip cream
5,my favorite apple pie recipe sometimes i add a little pumpkin pie spice as well just to spice it up a notch
5,this is a great recipe i added cups of apples and tbls of butter next time i would add tsp of ground cloves to add a little zest to it it came out soupy but i let it sit overnight and it was fine i will be making this again for sure
5,very good recipe didnt last long at my house
5,over and over and over this is by far the best apple pie recipe i have found
5,ive never made a pie before and i used this apple pie recipe as my first attempt and it turned out great yum
5,this pie is great everyone loves it everytime it isnt too sweet for me to avoid it being runny scoop the apples out of the bowl instead of dumping them into the crust that way any leftover mixture that didnt coat onto the apples will remain in the bowl a recipe
5,as a member of our local american legion i often donate baked goods to our monthly steak nights what says america more than homemade apple pie this recipe is super easy and delicious will definitely make again and again
5,we loved the pie after reading the reviews i did added heafing tablespoons of flour to thicken the pie came out great i served the apple pie for dinner with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the top
5,i just made this apple pie today and it came out wonderful thats saying a lot because i am not a big fan of apple pie i added a tiny bit of clove because i like that flavor great recipe
5,made this tonight and the flavour is amazing i did add extra flour to thicken as well will probably add more next time perhaps an extra t also added a couple of sprinkles of watkins apple pie spice kids probably would have eaten it all if i had let them i may reduce the sugar a tad next time but still enjoyed just the same
5,wonderful pie its the only recipe ill use
5,loved it and so did everyone that tried it great thank you
5,i recently went to an apple festival in nc i had never made a pie before any pie and wanted to give it a try i used honey crisp apples from grandads farm and a pie crust recipe from this site i carefully followed all directions absolutely wonderful
5,made as written except added hot sauce to beef used whole package of taco seasoning and split between meat and sour cream used extra cheese and put lettuce and tomato on side so everyone could add their own only reason is for reheating left overs was yummy quick and easy
5,everyone liked it even my picky eater gave it a which is pretty good lol the kind of recipe you can adapt to your tastes and addsubtract things i followed the recipe except i used corn tortillas and fried them as others suggested and i found the bottom too hard to cut so follow the instructions and put them in uncooked i also added green onion as a garnish
5,excellent recipe i used corn tortillas
5,i cut up the tortillas to layer in pan instead of leaving whole so it is easier to cut or spoon out of dish and i used plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream to cut calories
5,this pie is very good classic apple pie
5,apple piewow so yummy i added tsp of apple pie spice to the rest of the ingredients it was great thumbs up on this recipe
5,tasted just like apple pie should yummy
5,perfect apple pie recipe this will stay in my recipe file forever
5,yum yum this pie was very easy to make and very delicious
5,this is sooo good
5,it is a tad bit sweet so when i make it next time i will cut down the sugar some otherwise it was fantastic
5,love this recipe i used ready made pie crust by pillsbury other than that i stuck to the recipe it was a big hit with my family so easy
5,very good recipe very easy to make and tasted wonderful i also added some caramel syrup to it yummmmm
5,family favorite
5,its awesome but my came out runny even though i followed directions exactly and let it cool for hrs
5,by far the best fajita seasoning mix i have come across made it the first time as written then for our taste the only thing i did different was decrease cumin to tsp and a pinch and increase chili powder to tsp and a pinch thats it i have used this for beef also but for beef use tbsp lemon and tbsp lime juice absolutely the best homemade fajitas
5,this is the bomb boom boom real authentic real delicious no left overs the plates were scraped i will be making this my hit dish go tofantastically delicious
5,my family enjoys this fajita recipe so much that we have it once per month i add an extra two peppers and an extra onion
5,loved the marinade only changed a few things used boneless skinless chicken thighs because i prefer the dark meat added jalapenos with the bell peppers and yellow onion it was pretty dang spicy but i like a lot of heat also i added some of the marinade from inside the bag to the pan with all the veggies and put a lid on for the first minutes to effectively steam them before blackening them on high served the whole thing on rice with refried black beans mixed in note this recipe would also be great on nachos if you dice the chicken smaller or cook it whole and shred it
5,this is my rd time making this awesome dish i had to look for it on the internet and found you because i remembered the recipe from before i really enjoy these chicken fajitas
5,i never leave reviews because i always forget but this recipe is amazing followed it exactly and am very impressed with how delicious and easy this is
5,this dish had the perfect blend of spices very flavorful but my mouth wasnt on fire my family loved this recipe
5,excellent i made a halfrecipe for the two of us and served it with cheeseandsalsa rice dh thought it was terrific too another keeper from toh
5,we love this recipe i have made it times in a few months it is flavorful and delicious made homemade tortillas to use with it we only add salsa amp sour cream
5,my family loved this recipe for our chicken fajita night unfortunately i didnt have any chile powder so missed that extra heat but still so tasty thought it might be a little too salty but it was just right i tend to be conservative with my use of spices due to my husbands preferences but he enjoyed this too thanks
5,ive made this recipe twice since the august issue of toh came out wonderful i always order fajitas when at mexican restaurants because i cant have rice and beans never thought i could make these at home this recipe is a keeper vfe
5,my acrossthestreet neighbor and her niece made these fajitas for dinner nights ago and were kind enough to invite me to have some with them they followed the recipe exactly and i must say i would not change a thing the level of heat was perfect for me the chicken was tender and flavorful and the peppers just the right amount of crunch they reminded me of the chicken fajitas i used to get at planet hollywood when i visited atlantic city nj if you havent tried this recipe i suggest you try it it will become your new go to fajita recipe perhaps make them with shrimp instead of chicken next time
5,i love this chicken fajitas and ill definately try this chicken fajitas recipe this weekend the best thing about this recipe is that it takes very less time in making this recipe even i have a special chicken fajitas stuffed pepper recipe as well check out the recipe here
5,i cheat like hell out of sheer laziness and cut the prep time in half and this is still a hit with the whole family rather than slicing and cooking chicken peppers and onions i use trader joes oz grilled chicken strips from the refrigerated section and a bag of their frozen fire roasted peppers amp onions i just cut the chicken strips into smaller strips to make them fit better in the tortilla and marinate them exactly as in the recipe when the chicken is done marinating i just heat up the peppers n onions for about minutes and then dump in the chicken to get it warm and its done and delicious i also use trader joes whole wheat lowcarb tortillas that work and taste great in this recipe while saving some calories doing it this way total prep and cook time is about minutes but if you dont tell anyone theyll think you actually worked hard making it i love cheating
5,delicious and so easy may need to add to our weekly rotation
5,very flavorful and would definitely make again we prefer less chili spice we prefer a milder taste so i cut the chili powder in half tsp and left out the optional red pepper it was perfect
5,basically followed original recipehowever we preferred a bit more lettuce tomato etc this is fun because you can make little adjustments to your familys liking and it is still amazing sorry but even a little mushy i dont see how it would ruin the taste or make it gross if it boiled over in your oven and you used a x pyrex it is because the recipe calls for an xpan usually things boil over if your pan is too small or your oven cooks too hot my family thought it was greati thought it was nutritious hidden and we had fun all making it together
5,oh my goodness this was good i didnt have any ground meat but i had leftover brisket and it was perfect
5,so good even my picky eaters loved it
5,what a great recipe came together quick and my whole family loved it would be a very easy recipe to accommodate to your familys personal tastes
5,great recipe everyone loves it and its easy to make ive tried the recipe using flour tortillas and with corn tortillas both ways are good but my family prefers it with the corn tortillas
5,super quick and easy family meal entire family loves this recipe and its even great for leftovers we prefer the flour tortillas it many have recommended corn if youre a fan i did not add the sour cream as my son and his dad hate it it still turned out fantastic definitely printing out a copy for my recipient books
5,so easy and delicious we like a bit of heat so i added red pepper flakes to the beef and onions and mixed in some pickled jalapenos slices to the finished mixture before baking to spice it up a bit will definitely make it again
5,very quick to make and quite tasty thanks for a great recipe
5,this was a hit at my house i used corn tortillas that i fried didnt add the italian dressing but did add garlic cloves and jalapeno to the hamburger while cooking just the right amount of heat for us
5,very easy and my husband and son loved it
5,fabulous and tasty easy to make my kids wanted seconds followed the recipe
5,i thought this was delicious and my whole family agreed i did read the comments before making it and saw that one suggested using more taco seasoning which i did and was thrilled with the outcome i left out the italian dressing and cilantro and we were out of tomatoes and lettuce so i did tweak it quite a bit but it ended up amazing we will definitely be making this again
5,made this with only lowcarb tortillas ricotta cheese instead of sour cream had more of that added shredded cheese to each individual serving used a turkey breakfast sausage for meat had on hand cut calories
5,big hit in our house i use corn tortillas and leave out the italian dressing because its not something i keep on hand have already made this three times and its on the menu again for this weekend the whole family loves it
5,great casserole everybody loves it we typically make this dish for families with new babies or people who have had surgeries etc and we always get asked for the recipe its delicious
5,left out the italian dressing used corn tortillas did not use enough i only made one layer of torn tortillas next time i would use more since i suspected there werent enough i sprayed tortillas and baked them the last minutes of the casserole so we had chips i added refried beans along with the black beans and stirred in greek yogurt instead of sour cream i also used ground turkey instead of beef we loved it
5,wow quick and easy and so good i thought the italian dressing was an odd addition but i think it adds to the flavor i did however leave out the black beans picky kids
5,i made this for a neighborhood gettogether and it was a big hit i will definitely make it again i had tortillas so i made a third layer i also had ground elk and used it instead of beef it has very little fat i used cups of cheese thanks for sharing
5,this was a perfect recipe for my son to make who is learning to cook he did it all himself following the well written directions it really was a tasty dish and the presentation was lovely son was quite proud of himselfeven took a picture to email a friend i told him he will have to fix it again for cinco de mayo thanks for sharing
5,i have made this several times and it never disappoints i generally buy the burrito size tortillas since one will fit nicely in the bottom of my round casserole dish i then place half the burger mixture on it and layer it with one more tortilla and finish as directed so easy and quick to make
5,i loved this recipe the flavors are great i made this exactly as stated and wouldnt change a thing
5,loved this recipe made it for my husbands poker buddies they gobbled it up i did use more sour cream than called for but that only made the dish more creamy used a little more mexican blend cheese than called for i did add the italian dressing and didnt see that it altered the dish adversely i will definitely make this dish again served shredded lettuce chopped tomatoes guacamole and extra salsa on the side also served a corn salad which was made ahead
5,i added a diced bull pepper and a half can of rinsed corn and didnt use cumin or the dressing because of the other reviews where people said it didnt add to the flavor of the meal it was awesome i also used probably three cups of cheese and it was almost quesadilla like very delicious and different for basically tacos or burritos my five kids ate every bite
5,great recipe my family loves things cheesy so i added more cheese and sour cream
5,oh so very good the leftovers were even better i highly recommend
5,we really liked this dish i used corn tortillas instead of the flour for the beef mixture i used refried beans instead of the black beans and also added green chiles and corn i didnt have mexican cheese so i used sharp cheddar this is a very versatile recipe so using the suggestions of others worked well i will definitely make this again thanks for sharing this recipe
5,my kids love this recipe its a huge hit at our dinner table
5,weweewe
5,faimly and friends loved it
5,favorite
5,halved all ingredients and omitted italian dressing my husband and i loved it one serving left that we will have to fight over
5,i completely forgot to put the italian dressing in however it was great easy to make and we will definitely have it again
5,we love this i did lightly blend the salsa and onion because the kids dont like the texture i mixed the sour cream together with the meatbean mixture and used more cheese about cups
5,excellent dish ive made it with ground beef turkey deer and today i used elk i also make homemade tortillas another taste of home recipe just to make it as healthy as possible thanks for sharing
5,super easy to make great taste family loved it
5,excellent i made it last week chicken and beef and even the leftovers were tasty were having it again tonight this will be on the menu several times a month im going to make up a big supply of the spices to save time
5,tried this as a change from our old style of fajitas we happened to have all the ingredients on the shelf at home really great taste and fairly easy to make definitely will be having this dish again soon
5,what i love about this recipe is that you probably have everything in your pantry we make this at least once a week i live with something guys and they love fajita bar night i cook the chicken first and then the veggies after so it picks up all that good chicken flavor i serve it bar style i cut up tomatoes avocado lettuce shredded cheese guac salsa sour cream etc and let everyone build their own fajita this marinade is also excellent with shrimp it is so good i have started putting all of the spices into baggies and then when i want to make the fajitas i just have to add the oil and lemon juice and go highly recommend
5,a family favorite
5,love this recipe been using it for years more recently in an attempt to increase our vegetable consumption i add a couple of zucchini squash sliced in long spears which i cook with the onions and peppers makes a great and healthy addition
5,this fajita recipe is so full of flavor everytime it has become a regular on our familys menu
5,i ended up making this two nights in a row because everyone loved it so much the first night i forgot to add the paprika to the marinade so i added to the chicken right before cooking it i thought it was more flavorful doing it that way i might try not marinading at all next time
5,the marinade adds so much flavor to the chicken building your own fajitas is a really fun option when you have dinner guests or just for a normal nightly dinner
5,this recipe is fabulous i give it stars and i didnt change a thing followed it exactly my husband exclaimed these are really flavorful and he didnt even know that was the recipe title so these fajitas are aptly named and absolutely delicious i ate one the next day for breakfast thats how good
5,absolutely killer was a huge hit with the family i let it marinate overnight and cooked in a grill pan on the stove will definitely make this again
5,this is so delicious and so easy definitely will make every week thank you for making my life better with this easy and fun to make recipe its totally awesome will never buy fajita seasoning again
5,these are really good and easy to make i need to make it more often even my husband who is tolerant at best of chicken breast said they were good
5,i normally dont leave reviews but this recipe was so good everyone ate it my kids are picky but their plates were wiped clean and my husband doesnt really care for chicken breast but said who ever created this recipe is genius very good
5,we love mexican meals and this is a very easy and tasty recipe i followed the recipe exactly and served with cheddar cheese salsa sour cream and guacamole we had this meal last week and my year old grandson couldnt get enough he likes being able to add only the toppings he wants one family member skipped the tortilla and saved herself some carbs in the future i will also offer black beans or refried beans and rice yummy
5,i love mexican style meals better than my wife but she gave these five stars also i complimented these with refried beans recipe compliments of ree drummond arroz rojo aka red rice recipe compliments of marcela valladolid and quacamole for the two of us this was to much to eat for one meal but it was excellent the next day two tips the refried beans freeze well for use at a later date if you have plenty of left over quacamole smooth it out on top and gently add a thin layer of water the next day pour the water off and you have quacamole that didnt turn brown
5,i didnt make any adjustments i love it and friends and family love it just as it is
5,i take this to potlucks and everyone loves it i use black bean and corn salsa just wonder how long to cook it in a crock pot
5,my family and i really enjoyed this meal it was easy to prepare and i will definitely serve it again
5,excellent i omitted the sour cream amp italian dressing because my husband isnt a fan of those foods it still came out moist amp tasty this will certainly be a repeat dish jalapenos would be a good addition for extra kick too
5,new family favorite
5,i used a can of mexican stewed tomatoes instead of salsa and added a can of corn and some diced jalapenos it was delicious new favorite

5,definitely went back for seconds
5,this is an awesome recipe quick and easy cilantro sets it off thanks
5,i have to tell you that the first time i made this was in mexico my mexican friends loved itdeveras if you are finding the bottom too crisp then spread a little salsa in the bottom of your pan first i always make it in a round casserole pan that accommodates the size of the tortillas i use if there is anything leftover the taste is even better the next day for lunch i serve with hot salsa on the side to accommodate all tastes
5,instead of the black beans i used refriedbeans and layered each tortillaalmost like a mexican lasagna
5,excellent and easy to make i thought the degree oven temp excessive so i baked at degrees for the specified time also spread a little salsa on bottom of casserole dish no burning or crisp tortillas this dish is definitely a keeper next time i will kick it up a little by adding some green chiles andor chipotle chiles in adobe to mix
5,delicious i left out the dressing because i didnt have any i took this to a ladies dinner at church and didnt bring home a single bite everyone raved about it i added a little salsa to the bottom and mixed the sour cream in the meat mixture as others recommended easy and delicious i cant wait to make it again
5,we really liked this recipe easy and delicious

5,this recipe is amazing and i will definitly be making it again my kids liked it too but it was a little spicy for them so i think i would lessen the taco seasoning next time i also think it looks funky with the sour cream baked in it so i think i would leave that for a topping after it is done
5,even my very picky yr old son liked it

5,this was great my kids loved too
5,this is easy to prepare and very tasty
5,this was fabulous my family gobbled it up so quickly will definitely be making this again thanks for the wonderful recipe
5,husband said this is a definite recipe to make whenever we have guests over for dinner that is saying a lot obviously
5,oh my goodness this is so good and super easy the change i did make was not in ingredient but in preparation i mixed the salsa and sourcream together which made it much easier to layer than sourcream by itself will definitely make again
5,loved this recipe even though i found it in the comfort food diet magazine it still seemed a little heavy i made some substitutions i used lean ground turkey instead of ground beef used the entire lb package instead of the lb of ground beef called for in the recipe since i didnt want to freeze the extra lb by itself i dont like italian dressing so used cup v juice instead of ¼ c it dressing next time i will boost it to or c if i use the extra gr turkey again cut the number of flour tortillas to per layer instead of results in ww points plus for servings
5,this was great when i crave mexican this is what i want my family couldnt get enough of it i cant wait to make it again
5,very easy to make and tasty impressed my family that includes three chefs will make again
5,my husband is pretty picky but said that he would want me to make it again i used pepperjack cheese and med salsa mild it was terrific easy and delicious
5,my family loved it will def make it again
5,fantastic easy to make a little messy but the end result is tasty and leftovers were gobbled up just as quickly
5,sorry but i didnt use any fat free stuff browned beef and onion drained added packet taco season cumin salsa salad dressing and kidney beans we dont like black beans heated in skillet and served meat mixture over crushed tortilla chips added cheese lettuce tomatoe raw onion and sour cream on top of each serving great recipe we had to force ourselves to stop eating

5,this was great full of flavor and simple to put together it wasnt time consuming either my kids absolutely loved this we added calorie guacomole also
5,this recipe was great my whole family loved it and it was very filing i used ground turkey instead of beef and i forgot to add the cilantro but i thought it was still great
5,i have made this a couple of times and the entire family loves it i did take the advice of spreading some salsa on the bottom of the dish before the tortillas and it worked out much better
5,this is one of my husbands favorite meals and mine also because it is so easy to make i leave out the cumin because i do not care for the flavor but otherwise i follow the recipe exactly we eat this for lunch and dinner multiple days in a row because it is so good
5,the whole family loved it a keeper
5,my husband enjoyed and saidmake it again which is his star rating
5,i tried this recipe for the first time tonight amp am thrilled with how well it came out the flavour is great amp thanks to my salsa has the perfect amount of spice i used ground turkey instead of ground beef amp added kidney beans i love how easy amp quick this dish is to make
5,this was incredible i used regular cheese and sour cream and it was fantastic
5,this is a very good recipe my husband loved it it was a little too spicy for me so i think i will use a milder salsa next time couldnt tell the difference with the italian dressing in it at all but will use it again i did use regular sour cream and cheese instead of lite
5,absolutely delicious and easy to prepare
5,husband said this is a definite recipe to make whenever we have guests over for dinner that is saying a lot obviously
5,everyone really loved this i marinated chicken breasts for a few hours in this i forgot to add the lemon juice and used regular kosher salt because thats what i had on hand then i cooked the chicken on the grill i didnt marinate the peppers but will next time also will try it with shrimp and will do the chicken peppers and onions on one sheet pan all together if im not grilling
5,this recipe is a keeper i have made it with chicken steak and shrimp for the steak i added cilantro to the marinade it always tastes super fresh if you are a camper this is a great and easy recipe bc you can marinade the chicken slices while they are in your cooler and if you cut up more onions and peppers you can make kebabs for a nd dinner and save money and cooler space i honestly love this recipe its a go to
5,so delicious the whole family agreed this is our favorite homemade recipe
5,pamazing flavor and easy to make thumbs up from everyone p
5,anyone tried baking the chicken in the oven whenever i try to fry on a skillet pan my chicken is always raw in the middle thanks
5,this is my favorite potpie recipe its great to make when i need some homemade comfort food
5,this turned out great i used less expensive ground beef instead of the more expensive chicken i also made my own pie crust with my favorite recipe the frozen pie tasted like it had never been frozen i dont need to look for another pot pie recipe this is it
5,this is the best recipe my freezer cooking group uses this every time we get together we have also adapted it to using beef stew meat to make things really easy we buy deep dish pie crusts and top with pillsbury refrigerated rolled pie crusts packed into a gallon freezer bag and labeled with instructions they are so nice for giving to families in need as well as my own home
5,by far the best homemade potpie i have ever made we really really loved it
5,this is a wonderful pot pie my husband and son loved it there was none left from the one pie
5,i adapted the recipe and skipped the potatoes and carrots i in turn used cups of frozen mixed vegetables to make this truly a quick fix my family loves it so much that the nd pie doesnt make it to the freezer any more
5,my husband and son both loved it i used a pillsbury crust and a leftover store bought bbq chicken my husband grew up on homemade potpies and his mom is the best pastry maker i know so i was ready for an its okay but got a wow this is really good one of the best ive ever had he even went as far to say that he was a little hesitant when i said that i was making a chicken potpie dont know where that came from as im a good cook another plus is that it made two good sized pies
5,i absolutely love this recipe and so does my husband i double the amount of thyme and black pepper if im short on time i will use oz cans of mixed veggies in place of the potatoes carrots corn and peas i also like to use fat free halfandhalf if i have it on hand
5,forgot to add that i used only cup of butter by accident and it turned out just as good
5,i tested other potpie recipes trying to find the perfect one this is by far the best and the one that made its way into my permanent recipe collection this is one of my favorite dishes to take to new moms or shutins because its a double recipe one for my family and one for theirs its delicious
5,made this last night my family told me this one is a keeper i bought inch deep dish pie crust and i had enough filling to make pot pies and gave one to my neighbor i will definitely make this one again
5,my husband absolutely loved this he usually doesnt say things are good until i ask him what he thinks this time he took one bite and said it was really good i did what some of the other people did i put some salsa on the bottom of a x pan instead of layering the sour cream i added it into the meat mixture much easier to spread around
5,great dish i made a few personal changes used ground turkey full taco pack whole wheat tortillas but still wonderful my husband loved it i also used the meat mixture for tacos one night and used the remainder to make a smaller casserole for another evening
5,this was great so flavorful i did use significantly more sour cream than was called for but otherwise stayed true to the recipe and was very pleased
5,this is fantastic love love loved it
5,very good my whole family loved it and told me repeatedly that i will need to make this again i did put c of the salsa on the bottom of the pan as was suggested and i also stirred in the sour cream with the meat and beans i loved how easy it was to serve not having to add salsa or sour cream on the plate
5,made this over the weekend for my hubby he usually wont try new things but he loved this and so did i it was really easy to make and very delicious reheats well too next time im going to chop up some jalapenos and add to the mixture to give it more spice

5,easy to make and a filling meal we serve with spanish rice and tortilla chips
5,this is now definitely one of our favorites the italian dressing gives it a zest of flavorvery yummy
5,i made this recipe using tortilla chips instead of the flour tortillas it was delicious i will definitely make it again
5,loved it i used chunky mango habanero salsa and standard hot and the texture was great not runny at all i usually make my own taco seasoning and just mixed in some chile powder cumin oregano cayenne saltpepper and fresh garlic i also added minced serrano pepper i did make a couple minor substitutions shallots instead of onion and monterey jack instead of mexican cheese the only problem was i ate way too muchi think next time ill try corn tortillas and maybe add a can of corn

5,my boyfriend and i made this for dinner when his aunt and uncle came over it was a huge hit and absolutely delicious
5,this recipe hit the spot we were in the mood for mexican food but didnt want to make tacos so i tried this it turned out great the tortillas werent hard at the bottom and it had just the right mix of cumin and italian dressing really great flavors even my year old liked it and i wasnt sure if he would because its pretty spicy
5,this was excellent and very easy to make my kids and husband loved it they all wanted seconds i skipped the sour cream as some of us arent fond of it but the rest of us just put it on top great recipe
5,this is a great recipe for all ages the only change i made was to use an oz bottle of mild picante sauce instead of the salsa my kids dont like the chunks i spread a little sauce on the bottom of the pan before placing the tortillas this prevented sticking and hardness mentioned by others and also kept the casserole from being runny i will definitely make again
5,i made this for dinner tonight my kids could not stop raving about it i made some changes to the recipe used ground turkey used cup of salsa and can of rotei diced tomatoes with green chilies didnt add the sour cream inkids are not fans of sour cream but i added on top with the lettuce and tomatoes for myself great dish

5,wow that was incredible my kids absolutely loved it it was all gone in a flash i used a little bit of salsa to put on the bottom of the dish to prevent the bottom tortillas from getting too hard like some reviews had said it worked fantastic just a small layer to coatcover dish also i mixed the sour cream in the meatbean mixture instead of layering it because my kids dont like sour cream unless it is mixed in things they loved it we used tostitos mild chunky salsa amp kraft zesty italian dressing this is a family favorite now
5,just made this again amp wow it is fantastic i did some modifications this time to try some new things out this recipe is great as is but the additions were nice amp changed it up a little i added c frozen corn to the meatonions in the pan i added cloves garlic chopped to the pan towards the end of cooking i used c tostitos mild chunky salsa used a small amount to coat bottom of baking dish to prevent sticking which worked great i used cans black beans used c lite sour cream which i added to the meat mixture once it was done instead of using it as a layer i used c zesty italian dressing kraft used flour tortillas instead of amp put it all in a x baking pan i used oz authenic mexican cheese blend already preshredded amp more cilantro because we love it this is again amazing amp would be great for any family meal or potluck i would precut it for a potluck though cut with sharp knife first otherwise it will fall apart fantastic

5,this was so good and even great heated up the next day for leftovers i didnt go the lowfat reduced sodium way and added a bit more sour cream one addition i made was to mash up an avocado and spread it on the first layer of sour cream before the second layer of ingredients quick amp easy so i am sure it will become a regular at our house i let it set about minutes before cutting it and the pieces came out perfectly
5,one other thingi was tempted to leave out the italian dressing after reading another review but went ahead since i wanted to give the recipe a chance i wouldnt change a thing as far as the dressing is concerned we couldnt tell it was in there at all follow the recipe and you will be delighted with the results

5,wonderful i added fresh chopped green onion to the top
5,this was awesome i made a few tweaks of course i baked the crust at for minutes and then did a low broil for minutes before adding the topping just to crisp it up i also added turkey pepperoni to half of the top because my hub loves it this is exactly what we were looking for in terms of low carb pizza night thank you
5,what a great idea to use zucchini i made several changes to our liking i fried the beef up with an entire fennel bulb instead of sauce i poured sundried tomatoes over the zuke mixture then some canned olives green chilies i also didnt measure cheese im sure it was one half more took it out of the oven after minutes topped with fresh basil and sliced mozzarella and broiled until bubbling yum
5,this was excellent and my picky kids loved it they asked me where the zucchini was as they couldnt even taste it i added pepperoni to ours since my family loves pepperoni this recipe is a keeper and was a great way to use up all that garden zucchini
5,i did not have regular zucchini but used a green squash shredded i did use more mozzarella and cheddar cheese cups each oz of pizza sauce of a regular onion chopped lb ground beef chopped green pepper the regular parmesan cheese and eggs were kept as recipe stated i used a smaller baking dish x the size worked out great this is a great recipe i didnt have italianstyle tomato sauce on hand
5,got great reviews from the family on this was told to double it next time i did put a layer of pepperoni on the zucchini crust before the sauce mixture
5,winner of a recipe perfect for the summer garden abundance i did not have ground burger so used pork sausage and it was great and i confess to using pasta sauce for the tomato sauce as i had a half jar in the fridge but this was super tasty and will go into my files for the future
5,this is excellenta big hit i did use paesana new york classic pizza sauce instead of tomato sauce because its my favorite i just eyeballed how much i used i also used sausage instead of hamburger and added pepperoni because i love it im thinking of just baking and freezing the zucchini crust then adding the topping when im ready to make it i have so many zucchinis i figure i can store those easier in the freezer than the whole casserolebecause we will be eating this a lot i can tell
5,scrumptious what a great way to use up zucchini from my garden i plan on making this recipe again and again thank you for this fantastic recipe
5,we thought this was great i did change a few things though i used the suggested italian sausage ilo ground beef i also used pizza sauce ilo the tomato sauce we like green olives and mushrooms on pizza so i added those to the italian sausage mixture it was wondereful
5,im always looking for ways to hide the texture of ground beef and tried this we really liked it and ill make it againespecially since i have about yellow zucchini sitting around and no freezer room
5,we recently made a switch to lower carb eating this was really good and anyone who knows me knows how much i intensely dislike zucchini i spite of that i made and enjoyed this dish and will definitely make it again
5,excellent the only thing i added was italian seasoning when i cooked the italian sausage
5,this recipe was really good the only substitution i made was using ground venison
5,and once again i forgot to put in my stars this is a star recipe all the way
5,great recipe i used pizza sauce prego as recommended by other reviewers i also added teaspoon pepper teaspoon salt teaspoon pizza seasoning teaspoon basil teaspoon italian seasoning teaspoon frozen pizza seasoning and t garlic powder everyone loved it including the and year old grandchildren
5,this is a creative and delicious recipe with many options i made the recipe as listed with a few minor changes i added pepper to the crust mixture substituted turkey and used a red bell pepper as i find it milder for young palates this will be a regular in my rotation our tenmonthold grand daughter ate three large servings

5,i thought this was an awesome recipe interesting and quite tasty i did increase the meat to pounds and used a marinara sauce thanks for sharing
5,this is delicious great use of the abundant crop of zucchini from our garden low carb too
5,this was so good unfortunately i cant leave well enough alone had to add pepperoni and olives on top when the grandkids were here used shredded chicken bacon and alfredo sauce in xs for work endless possibilities for an wonderful base
5,wow if i didnt know i would not have known that it was a zucchini base what a great way to use zucchini i used my home canned marinara sauce and it was absolutely delicious
5,my sister told me she made this and how much she liked it since this is perfect for a diet i just started i thought id try it myself well i must say this is one delicious casserole the zucchini crust is so cheesy and delicious it could be a side dish on its own the hamburger topping just finishes it off perfectly the only thing i did different was to use a jar of pizza sauce instead of italian tomato sauce and i used a tablespoon of dried onion flakes instead of chopped onion this is a very good recipe on my meal rotation now
5,made this tonight it was wonderful i will be making it again as it has made the monthly rotation list in our house
5,ate this casserole at a church potluck and had to get the recipe i couldnt find italian tomato sauce at my grocery so i just got regular tomato sauce and added some italian seasonings you can also use spaghetti sauce too instead of the tomato sauce
5,im rating this as a even though i havent tasted it yet right before summer i made one of theseput in all in a very deep dish pie shell but it got hot and my husband didnt want me to heat up the house so i gave it to my son and dtr in law and told them to bake it they told me it was the best pot pie they had ever had and it was gone within hrs its just the two of them gonna make one for me and hubby this week and freeze the other one as recommended
5,doubled the recipe and got pies out of it cooking for a very large harvest crew and it was a hit they all loved it to save time i used canned chicken great recipe love that it makes lots i will use this recipe long after harvest its great to have extra in the freezer for those days when you dont feel like cooking
5,this is the best potpie recipe i share this one alot
5,i tested several pot pie recipes before settling on the best for my recipe box and here it is its my goto recipe for taking to new moms or shutins because the double recipe allows me to make dinner for my family and theirs
5,great tasting and easy to make i only wanted to make pie so i halfed the recipe and it worked out great
5,my family loved this recipe i think my yr old had helpings and my husband who usually doesnt like this had helpings i will definitely make it again
5,i make this potpie all of the time it is our favorite meal it is delicious i make it for people who are ill or have had a baby and its perfect because there is one for them and one for my family every single time i make it i get a request for the recipe i saute the chicken in good spices and chop for the best flavor
5,this is very good i plan to make it again for our church potluck thank you karen johnson
5,i made this pie for my family and they loved it i froze the other half and then made it for a work potluck and everyone wanted the recipe i did change it a bit instead of peas i put in frozen broccolli and made it with a homemade crust instead of store bought absoultely a keeper recipe
5,a very yummy comfort food
5,i poached the chicken in broth amp water with lots of poultry seasoning i also added tsp of thyme poultry seasoning amp salt to the mix it was absolutely fabulous
5,very easy to make and it is super delicious my whole family enjoys it and i enjoy them eating vegetables without arguing
5,so delicious my family loves this and its so easy to make
5,this is the best pot pie ever i plan on using leftover turkey in it after thanksgiving
5,used ground turkey instead of ground beef and added italian spices to the meat and the zucchini mix everyone loved it
5,i followed the recipe and it was wonderful my sons dad even liked it and he doesnt eat anything green need to dry the zucchini more but this is a keeper
5,this recipe finally got my husband to eat zucchini not only that hes been requesting it at least once a week since i discovered it on your site a few months ago getting the zucchini dry enough to crisp up was a challenge but we started using a handheld ricer to squeeze out small batches after shredding it in the food processor to save time it makes a huge difference and i find that using a stoneware bar pan is a big help as well i toss in a handful of italian seasonings to give the crust a little more flavor and have made this with a variety of meats in the sauce ground chicken turkey beef even elk and it has come out fantastic every time it only gets better the longer you let it cook
5,love love love the zucchini crust ive made the recipe several times similar to as written i substituted pizza sauce also i take the grated zucchini and place on a clean dishtowel and wring out the moisture no salt no colander this last time i made it like a real pizza delicious
5,i made this with the veggies from my garden it was so tasty that i will definitely make it again i found that it did not feed eight unless you have several sides or a giant salad the reason i like casseroles so much is so i dont have to make sides i feel to have it as a stand alone meal that the more appropriate servings listed would be or next time i make it which i will for sure i will double the recipe if i intend to feed more than loved it
5,great recipe and really easy to make hotdish cant believe anyone from minnesota would call it a casserole
5,excellent kids had seconds
5,it is like a pizza without a bread crust good recipe for a gluten free diet very tasty
5,excellent recipe didnt change a thing ill be making it again delicious
5,this recipe is great i like to add mushrooms to the sauce and top with black olivesyum
5,excited by this simple yet tasty glutenfree recipe
5,i cooked the pepper in with the hamburger because we dont like ours crunchy it was very good we also did add a little more salt and some pepper
5,
5,great recipe i use half ground beef and half hot italian sausage
5,delicious the kids will love it healthy
5,love this i drain zucc by spreading out large kitchen towel or two cover with a couple layers of paper towel then after ive pushed all the liquid i can out through the colander i spread the zucc on the towel layers and roll it up tight may take a couple times but it really does the trick and then your crust will be crisper also my grandsons think pepperoni is a food group so we dont use beef or sausage just spread pizza sauce over crust put a think layer of pepperoni on this then your cheeses and veggies sometimes bacon with the pepperoni why not after its done everyone puts their own toppings on as desired they love to help make it too so are happy to eat it
5,this is my favorite pizza recipe i dont do bread and this smells so pizza awesome i cant get enough
5,lynns recipe was fantastic my whole family loved a new dish which i feel doesnt happen that often i forgot the red or green pepper but it still tasted great i added a little drizzle of olive oil to the zucchini part just before layering on the meat sauce really really delishand easy
5,excellent hubby had helpings the only addition i made was tsp italian seasoning next time ill try sausage garlic
5,this is tasty i sliced my zucchini very thin instead of shredding it i mixed it with the eggs parm cheese and half the other cheeses but didnt bake it until i added the remaining ingredients as listed
5,made this last night for a potluck today everyone loved iti work with lots of people on keto and i was really glad to find something they could eat without needing to change anything just make sure you get the excess moisture out of the zucchini i layer mine on a cookie sheet and dried it out a bit for min before i cooled and combined it with the egg and cheese and you can get it firm without being too dry
5,i knew from reading this recipe that it would be tasty i am usually one of those review readers who does eye rolls when reading that the reviewer followed the recipe except forthen lists a long list of modifications well i made some changes too and the outcome was great i followed the process instructions as written i used sweet italian sausage instead of ground beef as i wanted a little zippier flavor more pizzalike i also added tsp of minced garlic after the sausageonion mixture was browned who doesnt like a little garlic in pizza my grocery store did not have italian tomato sauce so i used regular and added tsp of italian seasoning since the recipe called for either red or green pepper i used half of a red pepper and half of a green pepper giving the dish a colorful look my husband was a bit skeptical until the first bitethen he was a convert he raved about it and i do have to say it was delicious i had split the mixture into two casseroles with the idea of bakeonefreezeone ill have to see how that goes next time i make it because weve plowed right into the next casserole the next night leftovers were as delicious as the first night i have strict instructions to make this dish again
5,this is our favorite main dish zucchini recipe just top it with whatever your favorite pizza toppings are if you want more flavor than the ground beef i usually use the ground beef onion tomato sauce layer then might add some pepperoni olives sausage additional onion mushroomswhatever i want on my pizza love it love the results not watery at all
5,this was really good
5,my husband said this is a keeper i added some red pepper flakes to the zucchini mixture used prego pizza sauce amp added garlic amp italian seasoning to the meat he is on a low carb diet
5,excellent was looking for another low carb dish when i found this i sauteed some chopped mushrooms and added them to the sauce omitted the pepper cause we dont like it i used marinara sauce that was low in sugar in place of the tomato sauce this is very tasty my hubby suggested next time to use italian sausage instead of ground beef but i thought it was perfect
5,made this again with turkey sausage instead of the hamburger much tastier and hubby loved it so need to up the rating to a instead of a would definitely have again and again
5,perfect as is almost no carbs
5,we loved it hubby said it was a definite keeper and was even better the next day only changes i made based on some other readers was to make sure the water was squeezed out of the zukes and i added a can of mushrooms italian herbs and extra mozzarella because i had it cant wait to make it again next time am going to add italian sausage to it great recipe
5,love this thank you made with ground turkey breast yummy and freezes well for lunches
5,this was wonderful my husband and i are both on keto and this tasted so good it makes for good leftovers as well i followed the recipe exactly except for using frozen zucchini lots of water to squeeze out because i didnt have any fresh on hand i will definitely be making this again when we have a bunch of zucchini fresh from our garden
5,this is a great way to use up all that zucchini i added some garlic and using sausage gave it more flavor
5,this is so simple and so good had an abundance of zucchini from the garden and this is one of our favorite ways to eat zucchini the only change i made is that sometimes i add slices of pepperoni before adding the cheese topping a winner
5,we really liked this a good way to get your veggies
5,just picked a bag of zucchini so decided to try this recipe for supper i doubled the recipe except used lb ground beef and added a little garlic powder italian seasoning and basil to the sauce baked the crust for minutes but will do longer next time as the casserole ended up a little watery used a minute second bake even my zucchini hating husband raved about it
5,made this recently for a potluck it was delicious even the people who said they didnt like zucchini loved it this one is a keeper
5,this is one of my favorite recipes i made this for my bunco group and they all wanted the recipe this is a keeper
5,tried and true recipe i made it with ground buffalo and a bit more spices but how can you go wrong definitely try it
5,just made this and will be making it again but found it a bit bland so the next time i make it ill be adding a little heat and different more pungent cheese combination i didnt saute the red peppers and loved it that way hubby just went for seconds a good sign update just realized i used tomato sauce instead of a spiced italian sauce my bad trying it again this time ill read the directions more carefully
5,been making this for years i call it zucchini parmesian i saute some fresh garlic coat the zuchiini with some flaoved breat crummbs then fry just a littleput in casserole dish then just ad my marinara sauce mozzarella and parmesian and bake very flavorful with just the two cheeses
5,this is also good as a mexican casserole switch your cheeses to mexican mix cheeses and pepper jack same with sauce try rotel or even an enchilada sauce with chunky salsa
5,i also added some extra italian seasoning and garlic powder my husband who usually does not care for vegetables went back for more
5,very tasty versatile crust great way to use up the zucchini overload even those who dont care for zucchini will enjoy it have made it with a layer of ricotta fresh tomatoes and basil instead of the the meat sauce for a vegetarian alternative
5,this was fantastic we dont eat a lot of pizza because of the carbs so this is an incredible substitute for pizza we will definitely be making it again
5,excellent i liked it better fresh out of the oven so i will stick to a recipe square pyrex to limit leftovers delicious ps i used ground chicken instead of beef to lower cholesterol couldnt tell one bit of difference
5,made it with italian sausage instead of ground beef and added tsp minced garlic yummy everyone loved it i like the zucchini crust especially since it cuts down on carbs will definitely be making this again
5,so delicious i did use fresh grated parmesan cheese and topped with fresh sliced mozzarella didnt add any shredded mozzarella to the zucchini mixture only used cheddar and parmesan and still came out great
5,excellent recipe i wouldnt call it pizza per se reminded me more of carbless lasagna i cut the amount of ground beef in half doubled the onions and added about as much mushrooms i used jarred barilla traditional pasta sauce next time im thinking of using only half the cheese in the zucchini mix and replacing that amount with more zucchini and double the salt ill also add garlic as many commenters have suggested it holds up well as leftovers
5,have made this several times and everyone loves it
5,i did as someone suggested made half the recipe amp put in x baking dish i used prego and squeezed the zucchini with paper towels to remove more moisture fabulous even my zucchinihating hubby loves this will be making this again
5,loved it did add some more italian seasoning to it
5,we love this casserole we are on a lowcarb diet my husband and i and have a craving for italian food especially pizza this has solved our problem without busting the diet after the first time i made it i have changed it a bit not in the recipe but in the preparation since there are only of us i make the bottom crust in x inch pans lined with parchment paper partly up the side and sprayed with cooking spray i make half of the recipe in each and cook it as directed after cooling i lift it out by the parchment put both in a freezer container and freeze until we are ready to use it when we need a pizza we take one crust thaw it in the x pan and put the toppings on cook it in the oven as the recipe calls for it is almost as quick as a frozen pizza
5,this is just delicious i followed the directions exactly we all loved it
5,with over star reviews i felt this dish was a no brainer i like to try new toh recipes that dont have as many reviews yet but i wanted a sure fire meal for tonight it was yummyloved the baked shredded zucchinicheese base and cant go wrong with a tomato beef mixture with more cheese two thumbs way up and a perfect casserole to make anytime husband liked as much as i did
5,i made this casserole on and its delicious i did use small red peppers ground turkey in place of the beef cups shredded pizza cheese blend and cup pepperjackcheddar cheese blend since i had those prepared cheeses on hand id also added tsp salt and tsp pepper to the ground turkeychopped onion and i used a oz can pizza sauce i used a qt casserole delowenstein
5,this deserves all the fantastic reviews if you are looking for recipes that will work well with a spiralizer i used my thincut zucchini noodles instead of shredding them and it was great i loved seeing my kids inhale all the zucchini
5,this is excellent i loved that it tastes like pizza and the zucchini was essentially hidden in the dish i did make a few changes ground turkey instead of ground beef and i ran out of mozzarella cheese so i ended up using cheddar to replace it i would absolutely make this again maybe adding a few pizza toppings to it as well
5,i have made this many times now and every time its still fantastic only changes ive made is that i use frozen chopped peppers and onions and cook them with the hamburger i also use plain tomato sauce and just add italian seasoning and garlic
5,i made this years ago for my veggie hating kids making it now for my veggie hating grandkids hubby and i love it and the grandkids dont know what theyre eating works for me
5,has become a favorite at my house added two cloves of garlic to the sauce and half onion and its delicious
5,love this great way to use up a jar of pizza sauce too come summer everyone has zucchinis everything is in this meal tooa filling side dish or a complete meal made it in ramekinsa good way to serve it toospray the ramekins thosausage substitute works as wellbiggest deal is getting all the water out of the zucchini
5,this recipe is really really good ive also used the zucchini cheese and egg mix as the base for eggplant parmesan instead of pasta everyone loves it
5,loved this recipe the only thing i did differently was i cooked the peppers with beef and onions tastes even better as leftovers the next day
5,this recipe is really good and a great summer dish for when zucchinis are in abundance i loved the zucchini crust it was such a nice change of pace to a heavy bread crust the only changes i made were based on using ingredients on hand used an italian cheese blend for the mozzarella and a colbyjack blend for the cheddar because i had both of those i love a dish that is versatile in that way so just use whatever cheese combo you like best on this dish and you should have a winner also i took the advice of others and cooked the bell pepper with the beef and onions because my family prefers that combo my skeptical pizza loving daughter ate this and said it was good i will definitely be making this dish again
5,absolutely delicious and so easy
5,this was amazing huge hit
5,we loved this will definitely make againmy husband said its better than spaghetti used canned pizza sauce and parmesan on top could use a little more zucchini i think i need to start growing zucchini lol
5,we have made this many times and love it i use pizza sauce instead of tomato sauce which is more flavorful to lighten it up a little we use percent cheese and turkey italian sausage or turkey pepperoni very easy to freeze and take in my lunch later too
5,i made this tonight and i must say it is delicious i did take a couple of suggestions from others i drained the zucchini for about minutes then i pressed out as much moisture as i could in the strainer then transferred to paper towel and blotted some more my casserole was not runny i added tsp basil and tsp oregano and minced garlic cloves to tomato sauce mixture and sauteed the green peppers with the meat and onion the sauce was anything but bland i will be making this recipe for a long time to come thank you
5,i made this yesterday with zucchini fresh from the garden i actually cut the recipe in half and it turned out just fine i also did not use hamburger but instead we used cup of pepperoni
5,this was excellent recommend cooking red pepper with beef and adding garlic italian seasoning and red pepper flakes to amp up the flavors we really enjoyed this
5,my family devoured this delicious dish after reading the reviews i made sure to dry the zucchini well and i jazzed up my sauce with some fresh herbs basil parsley and oregano and garlic and instead of ground beef i used hot and spicy breakfast sausage i had on hand cant wait to make it again with a layer of sauteed mushrooms thanks for this great recipe
5,excellent recipe
5,made this for the second time yesterday it was very good will definitely make it often during zucchini season
5,ive made this twice in the last two weeks as its become one of my husbands top faves of my recipes its just the two of us so i always halve the recipe and bake it in an x pan it takes a little less time and i cover it for the last ten minutes of baking to prevent over browning and we get three dinners out of it this time i made it in the morning as it doesnt heat the house up quite as much earlier in the day and we both think it tastes better after it sits awhile i generally avoid cheesymeaty dishes during the hotter months but this one doesnt come off as heavy because of the zucchini crust ive made it without the peppers on top or with roasted red peppers and its super either way
5,this recipe was so easy to make a little different way to use zucchini my guests loved itserved six not eight i will definitely make it again
5,excellent i used half summer squash and half zucchinia perfect use for some of the squash our garden is giving us i substituted mild provolone cheese for the cheddar and added some slices of turkey pepperoni for a little more pizza flavor i also gave the top of the casserole a sprinkling of penzeys frozen pizza seasoningthat really sealed the deal we loved this casseroleill definitely be making it again thank you lynn
5,made this tonight for supper there was just the of us we liked it so much we ate over half of it leftovers tomorrow i followed recipe pretty much to a tee loved it
5,outstanding recipe anyone whos tasted this always requests the recipe yes its that darn good
5,this was very good will be making again very soon thank you for such a great recipe
5,my husband really enjoyed the meal didnt have enough of some of the cheeses used what i had next time im going to top it with saute or canned mushroom you could top it with any of your favorite topping
5,this is definitely a do it again i will try adding some other pizza toppings next time

5,everyone loved this
5,i dont eat carbs pasta etc and cant wait to make this will probably add some ricotta on top of the zucchini
5,very good recipe i too added a bit more seasoning to the meat oregano and garlic but otherwise made as written i tend to like my food a bit more spicy so thought maybe id add some dried pepper flakes to the meat the next time very good warmed up the next day too i cant wait for zucchini season to make this again and again
5,this recipe is great its delicious and different we tried it with sausage instead of beef first and that was way too salty that is not the fault of the recipe though i add italian seasoning to the sauce and cook the green pepper with the onion
5,awesome we practically cleaned out the bowl no leftovers so sad
5,excellent great low carb dish to satisfy cravings for pizza will be making this and changing up the meatveggies to make different varitiesthis time i used ground beefmushrooms and black olives i also added seasoning to tomato sauce red pepper flakes garlic powder and italian seasoning
5,ive made this recipe several times as written its a great way to use zucchini and its always a hit
5,i made this for the first time at the weekend and it really exceeded my expectations i was amazed at how easy and ridiculously tasty this was i made my own pastry from scratch and cant wait to make this again thanks for sharing

5,the best chicken potpie ever the first time we prepared this it was great the second time and after we knew what we were doingit was the best thank you so much for sharing this recipe
5,this recipe should have way more ratings a little time consuming to make but so worth it the frozen pie turns out great as well
5,this is the best i did cut back the butter by a stick i usually double this and make two x pans using homemade pie crust i also just use frozen carrots and skip the potatoes due to a family allergy but it does speed the process up a little bit
5,very tasty my friends loved it
5,seriously only use half the butter it calls for cup instead of cup it is still plenty rich and creamy it was great
5,this has been a family favorite since i first made it when i received this issue of quick cooking we have children so both pies would go in a single meal when all the kids were home now i can usually freeze one for laterunless some of my sons find out im making this amp decide to come home for supper that night i substitute cups of frozen corn for the peas as my husband hates most vegetables ive also made it with only the potatoes amp onions and i use tsp of poultry seasoning instead of thyme because i dont like the flavor of thyme my youngest daughter made it on her own for her th birthday because i only had the use of one arm at that timei talked her through it amp she was very proud of the compliments she received
5,yup that was the best darn chicken pie ive ever eaten and one to share even better
5,mmmm best chicken potpie gravy is delicious great for company
5,really really good used cup ea of butter amp flour as recommended did not have frozen corn so substituted sauted mushrooms amp celery and did not use a bottom crust poured a portion of it kept remainder for another day into an x dish covered w one rolled out sheet of puff pastry sprinkled w minced fresh parsley amp paprika baked for min servings our guests went back for seconds great w double cheese bread amp spinach salad a keeper
5,this was crazy easy to make i found though that it filled three regular pie shells probably two deep dish ones reheats beautifully and the seasoning is perfect
5,i made this for my husbands coworkers it was a big hit very easy to make and a great way to get people to eat their veggies i added one tsp of parsley to the sauce bc i could only find plain sauce
5,made this tonight and we both loved it since i just had regular tomato sauce i added italian seasoning and some garlic powder definitely a keeper
5,very good but extremely high in fat and cholesterol so not really a healthy dish but very tasty
5,very good i used sausage instead of ground beef also added pizza sauce to tomato sauce because i didnt have italian tom sauce i will definitely make again
5,awesome will make again and again
5,this was wonderful tasting in place of the ground beef i used sausage and in place of the italian tomato sauce i used homemade marinara the zucchini will be soggy if you dont drain it properly but it still tastes good you can pour off the extra liquid for nice and firm leftovers
5,my husband is not a picky eater but my children and i are we all loved this so much we made it twice and brought it to a family party where it was devoured great texture flavor and taste i made sure to not only drain the zucchini but blotted it with paper towels it was perfect

5,i made this recipe the other night and it is fantastic i didnt use tomato sauce i used a can of stewed tomatoes and added tblspn of basil and thyme to make it more italian i cooked it down until the liquid dissipated it was super delicious
5,my husband and i loved this dish very flavorful and easily made i followed the recipe as written except for the substitution of pizza sauce for the tomato sauce i like that this casserole may also be frozen and the next time i make it and there will definitely be a next time i think i will put it into two dishes and pop one in the freezer for later great recipe
5,family loves this recipe i skipped the green pepper but added garlic and mushrooms i used one can of tomato sauce and can of diced tomatoes drained and pureed to give it some texture and also added italian seasoning basil and garlic powder i have shared this with many friends thank you
5,had last night for dinner and it was excellent we are trying to go low carb and this looked great i made sure the zucchini was well drained and i baked it minutes and the crust was fine i did leave out the cheddar cheese and added more parmesan i also used turkey italian sausage for more flavor and we dont eat much beef topped with it with regular jar spaghetti sauce since that is all i had and yellow peppers onion some garlic so yummy

5,my husband hates zucchini when i served this dish he raved and raved about it he thought the zucchini crust was actually rice but when i told him what it really was he just smiled and went back for seconds i will definitely make this again next time we may add olives to it for some extra zing but the recipe is great asis
5,this was really good i thought it tasted more like lasagna than pizza maybe it was because i used a jar of spaghetti sauce in place of the tomato sauce i did follow the ret of the recipe i will make this again
5,i made this tonight for supper with few adjustments package of ground turkey was a little more than a pound so added more onion plus used prego chunky garden tomato onion amp garlic spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce didnt measure the cheese anyone who loves cheese doesnt care if there is more most of the ingredients as to the amounts can be adjusted to your preference it was wonderful my husband thought it was really good amp kept taking a little more amp a little more i will definitely be making it again

5,i love this recipe its one of the reasons we grow zucchini
5,this was awesome my entire family loves it i usually use sausage pizza sauce and add green peppers and fresh mushrooms this is a keeper
5,this was good but i think i like lkimk recipe so im going to try it except for home made sauce ill use pizza sauce and no bell pepper we cant eat them ill use a banana or sweet pepper
5,my husband and i loved it since we live in new mexico i added chopped green chile it is a keeper next time i will also add fresh mushrooms
5,both my husband and i liked it and my kids loved it i did add some seasonings to the crust garlic italian seasoning basil and oregano

5,everyone likes this casserole whove tried it i use pizza sauce and add pizza toppings that we like mushrooms turkey pepperoni pineapple etc i make it very often year round
5,made just as written except for subbing pasta sauce for tomato sauce a keeper for sure love the low carb

5,delicious added a little crushed pepper flakes
5,my husband loved it and brought some for lunch to work he told and showed it off another guy wanted receipei did add pepperoni ontop with with italian stylesix cheese blend as finishing toucheven looked better
5,love this casserole great way to use up summer zucchini i have made several so we have some in the freezer for later
5,this was so good will make it again the only thing i did different was used pizza sauce instead of the tomatoe sauce
5,this was amazing draining the water out of the zucchini was more time consuming plan for atleast minutes i added fresh basil on top all kids and my husband loved it
5,very very good followed the advice from other comments i let the zucchini sit for minutes and squeezed out by the handful added lb of mild italian sausage and pepperonis on top even better the next day
5,so good and so easy wonderful way to use zucchini
5,excellent recipe will definitely make again
5,this is a fabulous way to use up extra zucchini i double the meattomato mixture as my husband and boys needed a meatier dish i didnt have italian tomato sauce and have found that one big can of hunts spaghetti sauce is perfect for the doubled mixture i agree it is even better the next day
5,excellent i didnt think my husband would like this be he did he thought it would make a good dip it truly is a unique way to use zucchini and it was delicious good leftover too
5,this was delicious i substituted pizza sauce for the tomato sauce and used pepperoni instead of ground beef yummy leftovers were great
5,very good i wish i had this recipe at the beginning of zucchini season will definitely make again three people ate all most the whole dish i let the zucchini set with the salt a good minutes i used some of my homemade salsa and homemade spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce i also topped with some of my pickled hungarian waxed peppers excellent flavor
5,i seen this recipe on here last year and have made it several times now my husband loves it so much i even had to buy zucchini from the store during the winter months and into summer till the zucchini was ready again once when i had been canning some homemade pasta sauce i had a bit left over in the refrigerator and decided to use that in place of the tomato sauce it was excellent also have used leftover taco meat that was good too thanks
5,after i wrote my review i was reading all the others and quite a few was talking about it being watery first let it stand about minutes then squeeze it out by handfuls that really helps but i found if i baked the crust about minutes or longer before adding the sauce makes for a firmer crust love it
5,very good
5,excellent it has already become a family favorite amp ive made it several times i added some pizza seasoning to the sauce to make it take even more pizzay
5,i wasnt sure that my family would go for this one but my two worst critics the husband and the picky son loved it i would agree with everyone else that the zucchini needs about min to drain and i took handfuls and squeezed it out and had no problems will be making again soon
5,i love zucchini this casserole is very good and leftovers are good too
5,i really liked this recipe quite a bit the flavors were excellent together and i loved the juiciness of the dish it was delicious i added a little crushed red peppers and some mushrooms to the sauce
5,delicious added a shredded potato to the zucchini mixture because i didnt have quite enough zucchini also added mushroom definately a keeper
5,our family loved this my husband not a huge zucchini fan and my oneyearold son both ate two pieces since my family is smaller i made it in two pie plates so we could give one away worked perfectly i agree with other reviews that the zucchini needs to drain longer at least minutes to get properly dry otherwise its a bit soggy will definitely make again
5,trying to watch my carbs this is delish i used pizza sauce and topped it with mushrooms and italian sausage crumbledyum put in containers for lunch this week
5,used italian sausage for meat very good use for zucchini
5,my husband and i love this dish i substitute the hamburger for italian style ground turkey which gives it more flavor than regular hamburger
5,this is my new favorite recipe i have made this dish about times in the last months i use a pound of sausage and a pound of ground beef cook them both combine with the spaghetti sauce and than divide i use one mixture right away and freeze the other for a later useyou can also make the zucchini crust a day early and assemble the whole recipe put it in the fridge and bake the next day for dinnerthis is my new lasagnaand so much cheaper too
5,i loved this recipe but used chopped pepperoni slices to make it really taste like pizza
5,this recipe is delicious i baked the crust for min replaced the green pepper with green and black olives will definitely make again
5,made this casserole exactly as the recipe is written next time tweaked it and used hamburger and italian sausage only because we like a little more spice this is a wonderful recipe our entire family loved it even my picky fatherinlaw and our year old granddaughter this is a keeper
5,i made this late night and everyone loved it i replaced the ground beef with ground turkey and added oregano garlic powder salt and pepper to the meat sauce
5,this was so good probably one of the best zucchini recipes i have made i didnt have any green peppers but used pepperonis on top instead i premade the casserole the day before but waited to put the remaining cheese and pepperonis on top until the last minutes of reheating before i put the pepperonis on top i microwaved them a bit and blotted off the grease then i cut them up and sprinkled them on top
5,this is one of my favorite recipes only i add one can of diced tomatoes and use one small can of sauce instead of the oz can of sauce
5,terrific recipe i did sub my homemade pizza sauce for the tomato sauce because thats what i had i left out the cheddar and increased the two other cheeses to make it up i also added pepperoni will make this again and again thanks
5,i cut up the chicken in cubes and sauteed it in some olive oil and sprinkled a little adobo on it once i added the broth to the recipe i also added about a teaspoon full of chicken base to the sauce better than bouillon also i did have to add a little bit extra broth to help thin the filling out a little bit my family and friends loved this
5,this was so good i cant wait to make the second one thats in the freezer i would put less thyme in it if any but i will be making this again
5,we also had enough filling for a third pie we found that the crust browned before the bottom crust was done cooking but we rather enjoyed the creaminess it added if we make it again we would likely cut the thyme in half and add a second seasoning it was just a lot of the same flavor
5,this turned out so good i did a few things different thoughi used cup flour and i bought a premade rotisserie chicken from the store and used that also instead of using a crust i baked it for minutes then top it with unrolled cresent rolls and baked until the cresent rolls were golden mmmm so good will def make again
5,i made this on and it was delicious i cut the recipe in half and only made one pie as i was unsure if it would turn out amp it tasted great
5,first time i ever made a chicken potpie it was excellent my husband and kids enjoyed it and want me to make it all the time thank you for sharing
5,this was my first time making a homemade pot pie it turned out great i halved the recipe and made one deep dish pie and had no leftover filling the only change i will make is to use a little bit more chicken broth for the gravy mine ended up just a little too thick even before the boilingthickening stage
5,i have been making this recipe for years definitely one of my favorites love having one in the freezer for later
5,this was great except i felt it called for a bit too much thyme so i will make it with less next time but otherwise it was delicious
5,also i added a bit extra pepper and salt while mixing before putting everything in the pies it was to dull down the overpowering thyme which did help prior to baking it was strong after obviously
5,best chicken pot pie very creamy and hearty recipe was easy to follow freezes very well have made with chicken and also with leftover turkey from thanksgiving will make this again and again
5,this was great the first pie was wonderful and we had the other one last night cooked that one for an hour at with no temp change and it came out fine
5,phenomenal halved the ingredients to make one deep pie as well i didnt use as much flour either because i noticed the filling to be too thick so i used extra broth to compensate this was delicious
5,this was so yummy i actually made it in to mini pot pies using a muffin tin they were perfect size for my kids who really liked it i just halved the recipe and used a inch round cutter for the bottom and a inch round for the top and cut it out of the storebought pie crust i also brushed the tops with an egg wash
5,this recipe is amazing my family cant eat any other pie after making this i can typically get three pies out of this recipe but only because we like a little less filling this is by far my most requested recipe
5,super easy and made it sunday for the week added a bit of garlic power to the mix and baled the chicken in packets with olive oil salt and pepper along with a bit of chopped garlicyum loving it now
5,absolutely delicious my husband said its a do over he also took the leftovers to work and shared a bite with his supervisor and his coworker they also loved it and requested their own serving next time lol
5,i made twice this to take to two different gatherings and everyone that tried it loved it i have passed out several copies of the recipe and am still getting requests for it i did add a little minced garlic to the sauce then spinkled on fresh chopped basil and oregano on top before baking easy and tasty
5,my whole family really liked this recipe the only thing i did different was i added some dried oregano and basil to the beef mixture and crumbled strips of cooked bacon on top along with the green pepper ill be making this again
5,love this recipe cheesy and delicious i am always looking for new ways to use zucchini from my garden
5,i did not soak my zucchini and i use tomato sauce with italian herbs everyone loved it
5,of course i always have to tweak a recipe but i did add a bit of basil and marjoram to the meattomato sauce mixture i also added minced garlic i probably strained the zucchini for about minutes i probably squeezed cups of liquid out of it it still seemed wet but when i mixed it with the cheese it was almost a little too dry to combine until i mixed the eggs in i also sliced roma tomatoes sprinkled with basil pepper and salt on top before adding the top layer of cheese ill definitely make this again
5,this recipe is quick easy and delicious its definitely a favorite for our family ive shared it with friends and the reviews are the same i do have a couple additions that i feel complete the dishalthough not necessary fresh garlic and fresh basil
5,one of my year olds favorite things we add a bit more cheese than it calls for great for warming up at work the next day
5,what a great recipe
5,i absolutely loved this recipe and so did my husband it was especially tasty for leftovers the next day i will definitely make this again
5,i made this for dinner tonight and everyone loved it even my yr old good meal for my diabetic husband he said it was very filling
5,im not a huge fan of zucchini but am trying to eat more veggies this was wonderful i didnt even taste the zucchini i made this as is but it definitely lends itself to experimenting yum
5,all of us loved the flavor not hugely filling as is and quite watery from the zucchini next time i made it decided to add c of cooked spaghetti to zucchinicheese mixture delicious and completely filling have made it several times now and works out great has become a big favorite
5,my family loved this recipe we will definitely will make this againsooner than later
5,loved this i would like to try adding fresh spinach to this next time i used italian seasoned gr turkey i also sauteed the chopped onion with the gr pepper i also added some fresh basil to the turkey onion and gr pepper mix i used a nice marinar sauce from trade joes and did put black olives in under the top layer of cheese
5,very good my family loved it i used half spagetti sauce and half it talian tomato sauce and then added italian seasoning to give it a little extra kick i will definately make this again
5,followed advice to be sure zucchini is very dry and used italian sausage instead of hamburger this was awesome a definite keeper for my family
5,i didnt use the salt just let it set for about minutes like another review said to do i added a little bit of oregano and basil to the tomato sauce since i didnt have italian tomato sauce i might cut back just a little on the cheese taste was excellent will be freeze zucchini so i can have this during the winter months
5,made this for my family and everyone loved it awesome recipe
5,love this recipe low carb im diabetic and so easy to sub lowfat ingredientsi made mine with low fat cheeses and ground turkey breast everyone loved it
5,my family loved it let the zucchini dry longer and omitted the salt next time my family asked me to add mushrooms it was delicious
5,deliciousness surpassed our expectations made it last night and cant wait till we have it leftover tomorrow night used italian sausage in place of burger and added a few banana pepper rings to the top my husband said to be sure and write keeper before filing it away i would serve this to company
5,i have made this twice so far and my family and neighbors love it
5,absolutely wonderful i substituted pizza sauce for the tomato sauce since this is a pizza recipe i also added the onion along with the green pepper as pizza is normally made i gave the recipe to people the first day i made it for work
5,this was super my four kids came home from sports practice and loved it even the one who doesnt like zucchini i doubled the ground beef and used a can of spaghetti sauce i cooked onion and peppers with the meat i added a layer of pepperoni on top the meat layer i did not have cheddar cheese so omitted that it was fantastic i think i will try low fat cheese next time it is an excellent way to use up zucchini
5,some one gave me three zucchinis and this was one of the recipes i tried it was delicious looking forward to making it again
5,delicious i dont care for zucchini or hamburger but this was great you can mostly taste cheese yum also depending on how you fix up the tomato sauce it adds nice flavor i added some red pepper as suggested i also liked the green peppers on top the crispness was a nice contrasti would liken the bottom layer to an egg bake consistency and taste
5,very simple and tasty i think i might experiment with more toppings next time
5,whole family loves this casserole many come back for seconds
5,easy and delicious i added some leftover mushrooms to the beef and onions and some black pepper
5,wonderful delicious versatile cant wait to make it again the zucchini crust is fantastic the key is to squeeze all the liquid out and then squeeze it again you can make this any way you like your pizza it also reheats very well for leftovers thanks for this great recipe
5,i used spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce and it worked great also i omited the cheddar cheese and it was still delicious
5,my husband amp i loved this recipe i used putanesca spaghetti sauce and it was fabulous i will be making it for our family picnic
5,i made this for my family and they loved it i will definetely make it again
5,this was wonderful my husband raved about it at work and had people request the recipe
5,i made this for my family several months ago delicious i have made it more times since then my husband raves about it and my teenage son eats the zucchini with no complaints stars from us
5,have not made this recipe yet but sounds really delish my neighbor has an abundance of zucchini while i only planted two plants this year i will definitely print her out a copy of this recipe has anyone tried throwing in some sliced or chunked pepperoni too once i make the recipe as directed i always tweek it so i may add some pepperoni the second time i know my family will love this recipe cant wait to make it and will report back i may also make one for my son who went back to college and is living in an apt near campus he and his room mates would love this
5,i use pizza sauce instead of tomato sauce and i added chopped onions its so delicious and burst of flavors
5,for those worried about the sodium content you dont need to sprinkle the zucchini with salt let it stand for hour amp then wring it out really well it will be just as good as sprinkling with salt any recipe that has this much cheese will have a high sodium content as cheese is loaded with salt no need adding more if you can help it
5,this is a delicious pot pie recipe my husband absolutely adored it i frequently halve the recipe to feed just my family but when there is a new mom or a friend under the weather this is the perfect meal to take to them and still have dinner for your family as well you can never go wrong with classic comfort food
5,this recipe is delicious my husband loves it and so do i i like that it makes potpies i usually make one and freeze the other for another night
5,we had this for dinner tonight we loved it i added fresh garlic with the onion next time i plan on adding chopped celery delicious
5,excellent flavor the gravy would be good on other dishes as well i only used a top crust
5,this was so good amp easy to make i only used pie crust per pie amp left out the thyme its nice to know i have one pie in my freezer for a busy night
5,this was a huge hit with my family even my husband who has never been a fan of chicken potpie it took some time to prep but it was well worth the effort i love freezer cooking so having a pie for the freezer was a definite plus i used deep dish pie crusts and this made very full pies delicious
5,this was so good i wasnt sure how the leftovers would be but they were just as good as the first day it was cooked
5,love this recipe get so many compliments when i make it
5,this was delicious everyone had seconds the only downside was my largest frying pan which is quite large was not big enough i would suggest using a dutch oven instead
5,ive made this three times now and my family still raves about how much they love it full of flavor drives me crazy waiting for it bake i highly recommend this recipe the leftovers reheat just as tasty wonderful cold weather comfort food
5,this is the pot pie recipe i always use because it is so rich and satisfying i use half the butter and flour and add a few more herbs and some white pepper i love that the recipe makes two pies i make one for us and one to bless another family
5,i have made this several times over the years its delicious as is i usually halve it for our smaller family also its delicious to bake the zucchini base and sprinkle on top diced chicken green and red peppers onion olives and salsa to taste i use about cup for half the recipe to make a mexican pizza yum
5,this is a great way to use all that zucchini from the garden yum
5,everyone love it we served it with olives and sour cream on the side yum
5,has anyone tried freezing one
5,this is a fantastic recipe great way to use zucchini wasnt much left for leftovers
5,delicious my familys response you better double this next time great way to get those veggies in for people who may not like zucchini we did make one change used pork sausage instead of ground beef
5,this is one of my favorite ways to use fresh zucchini and the abundance of banana peppers from the garden
5,went together well tasted great i would be very sure to really squeeze out the shredded zucchini mine was a little too moist but still was great
5,this was an awesome recipe i used mushrooms instead of the green pepper and am going to try some pepperoni next time a keeper
5,love it and i dont like zucchini actually used some thai squash i had no idea what to do with tried some of the suggestions the sausage pepperoni and mushrooms and really like the result
5,this was amazing i have been looking for recipes that taste delicious but dont have the typical carbs like pizza crust or lasagna noodles and this was perfect i will be adding this to my list of favorites for sure
5,i made this and the next day it was all gone love it
5,ive been making this lasagna for years ever since i saw it in one of the contest winner books i especially love the meat sauce which i use for other recipes now i have since been required to go gluten free celiac but ive adapted it to the gluten free noodles this is just delicious
5,i followed exactly i found the sauce to acidic from the tomato paste so i added more sugar and adjusted seasonings there was plenty of meat sauce and so my x pan was filled to the top as described i did use no boil noodles with excellent results the recipe turned out delicious why others didnt like it is just personal opinion the recipe is a keeper
5,pthis is quite literally the best recipe i have ever found i am looking it up for the th time as it has been requested for a birthday dinner tomorrow by now i should have it memorized it does not disappoint p
5,this dish is to die for we did not plant garden this year but our neighbor provided us with an ample supply of zucchinisincerely
5,i found this recipe as i had some fresh zucchini to use up it turned out wonderfulit is definitely a keeper my husband and toddler both loved it the only thing i did different was sauteed my onion and green pepper and then cooked my meat and used my favorite spaghetti sauce it was absolutely delicious
5,we have made this zucchini pizza casserole times already this summer we loved it could probably freeze some grated zucchini and make it this winter too thanks from nebraska
5,this was really a great way to use up the zucchini in the garden it was delicious because my family really likes cheddar cheese i used a cup of cheddar on the top with the mozzarella everyone enjoyed it i also made just the base without the top and served it with a chicken dinner went over well
5,absolutely delicious fantastic as leftovers also
5,made this tonight dh says its a keepermy changes i used frozen shredded zucchini so didnt need the salt to draw the watersauteed the green pepper with beef and onionsprinkled sliced ripe olives on top of the meat sauce before putting on the cheeseswhen cheeses melted as it cooked the olives peeked thru will be making this again hope somebody gives us zucchini as i thought we had so much frozen from last year that we didnt plant any this year jan
5,this was very tasty i didnt have italian tomato sauce so i cooked the ground beef amp onion with cloves minced garlic tsp basil amp oregano some salt crushed red pepper amp paprika i only used can of tomato sauce and added a can of extremely well drained i actually squeezed handfuls out diced tomatoes delish
5,this was very good i think next time i will use some spicy chicken sausage instead of the ground beef it was a nice alternative to our regular zucchini dishes
5,i tried this out for a potluck dish everyone enjoyed amp was wanting the recipe will make again
5,wow this recipe is very delicious i made a couple of changes by using italian sausage instead of hamburger and i added hot peppers to the top i like spicey food so it turned out perfectly will definately make this again thanks
5,this is delicious and i love that it uses an entire big zucchini my whole family loved it and i will make it again i thought the bottom was a little soft and next time i make it i will try adding a couple tablespoons of cornmeal to the zucchini mixture with the hopes of it becoming like polentamarylynhope
5,i treated just like a pizza and added to the top mushrooms onions the green pepper and turkey pepperoni it was great i took it to a dog show and came home with an empty dish to make it healthy i used turkey pepperoni and turkey sausage and pizza sauce instead of tomato sauce
5,i spent two years in the toscana region of italy the italian snobs in here have no clue that this is actually better than any lasagna to be found in firenze florence bologna or milano milan cottage cheese my first thought was are you kidding me but after trying it i will concur that it is better than ricotta alone salud
5,best lasagna ever my family loves it
5,edit to my last review change cans of sauce to ros sensitive jar sauce
5,this is the rd time i have made this recipe and my family loves and i use the sauce as any marinara sauce i need a question to the author and readers i just caught today the recipe calls for oz cans of sauce i had never noticed they were oz cans and have been using the standard i could not imagine this with less was the oz cans a typo or is that how everyone has been preparing regardless of the answer i will stick to the larger cans but i am curious
5,this recipe is amazing and worth stars it is very close to a secret family recipe i have used for more than years yes you can use no boil noodlesif you must but dont give this recipe a low rating if you do and find it didnt quite meet your expectations make the recipe using the ingredients as written you wont be sorry
5,this is just what lasagna should taste like rich and delicious and like a warm food hug the sauce is incredible even more so after adding a cup of red wine added lots more tomato sauce after reading other reviews and it definitely was needed worth the effort to put such a tasty dish out for the family
5,ive made this lasagna several times and it is fantastic this is now my goto lasagna recipe for special occasions ive made it for christmas eve a few times and am planning to make it again this year for christmas day i love this recipe
5,amazing recipe my husbands family loves their italian food and i was so nervous to make dinner for them i found this recipe and have never looked back the only thing i do different is i have equal parts of ricotta and cottage cheese about cups each as we prefer a thicker consistency to really hold it together thank you so much
5,as with any recipe one tends to adjust to their own taste that being said toh altered my original submission of this recipe i dont do all those layers and use only layers of noodles total i continue to adjust my recipe twenty years later isnt that what all cooks do as we learn one thing i will say is you must use fresh ingredients to get the best results like shred the mozzarella preshredded cheese contains chemicals that keep the cheese from caking and does affect the results also dont use cheap ingredients garbage in garbage out if you use preprocessed ingredients dont blame the recipe i recently found a true italian grocery and used their home made goat cheese ricotta and was amazed at the difference that made in regards to the saucei have learned that weather like humidity actually makes a difference i purposely make a thick sauce so the layers stay in place as i dislike runny lasagne again personal preference thank you all for your comments and enjoy
5,ive made this times now i love this recipe its delicious
5,tastes delicious traditional or not
5,ive been making this lasagna for many years since i first discovered it in a taste of home cookbook its delicious and worth the effort ive tried other lasagnas but they dont compare to this one
5,absolutely delicious everyone loved it was wondering if anyone has made ahead and froze if so any advice
5,lasagna is not a dish that originated in italy so this is american lasagna and its delicious it uses cottage cheese which is not as gritty as ricotta can be lasagna comes from the greeks i actually make a greek lasagna better known as pastitsio it is layered pasta with ground beef but when i want american lasagna i make this recipe did you know the brits actually found a recipe for lasagna from the s each country has perfected their own claim to lasagna fame when the italians make it in northern italy they do not use ricotta cheese they use a creamy cheese sauce known as besciamella ricotta is used in the southern region only this is why many italians in america use ricotta most are descendants from southern italians so even mario or giada is making it wrong if you are from tuscany
5,i was so surprised by how delicious this lasagna turned out to be ive now made it times and now its my favorite i made it exactly as written
5,absolutely delicious this was the best lasagna i have ever made the tomato sauce was amazing i made it exactly as written i thought the seasoning would be a tad bland as it didnt seem like enough for the amount of sauce i was wrong it was perfect just the way it was i havent used sausage in my lasagna before and it will now be my norm this will be my goto recipe from now on thanks taste of home
5,this recipe is absolutely amazing i found this recipe years ago when i had moved out on my own into my new house this is my fourth time making it and it seems to get better every time good job taste of home
5,i changed things no sugar used ricotta cheese
5,love it i typically use more ricotta and less cottage cheese because its hard to find an oz container of ricotta i prefer italian sausage to plain pork sausage glad there is no onion because my daughter cant tolerate them yum
5,i was wary using pork sausage but what a great flavor it added to this dish this was a big hit with the family
5,love the use of provolone cheese i added a little more sauce
5,i ran across this recipe and it reminded me of my older cousins lasagne once i made it the first time it became my go to guide on layering and the cottage cheese ands ricotta sauce i use my own recipe for the sauce and i think the next time ill make it how i did as a young adult with burgundy in it oh so good
5,love
5,i dont care if this is traditional italian lasagna or not what is important to me is that it tastes good this looks like my long lost recipe for lasagna that i made in the s i got it off a box of pasta i am so glad to have found it again i cant wait to make it
5,ive made this recipe for years and it has always been a big hit this recipe screams traditional american lasagna in the very best way its very difficult to mess this one up as i have not always had every ingredient it calls for on hand provolone sausage ricotta etc i love seeing how everyone has put their own spin on it and it still comes out beautifully
5,best ever
5,i finally got to make this recipe to the t and it is amazing my little girl who doesnt eat any kind of combined foods loves it and asked me to make some again tonight thank you for sharing this awesome recipe
5,this is truly a star recipe the best lasagna that i have ever eaten the only tweak that i made was substituting seasoning salt for regular salt besides that i followed it to a t the whole family raved about it thanks for another winner
5,look no further by far the best lasagna recipe easy and delicious
5,i dont usually write reviews but i just had to i did add a cup of cabernet red wine to the sauce but other than that kept to the recipe my husband isnt much on pasta but he raved about this lasagna on the bite and went back for seconds it was truly delicious i think i will make it for our family christmas this year
5,this is hands down the best lasagna recipe i have ever tried my husband and sons both loved it the recipe was very simple and i was worried that it would not be very flavorful but this was perfect the sauce was amazing and the cheese mixture was fantastic many lasagna recipes turn out very runny but the cheese mixture in this was just right i used the lasagna noodles that dont require cooking and made sure to allow the lasagna to sit on the counter for minutes before cutting this will now be our lasagna recipe from now on thank you for sharing lorri
5,omg this recipe is amazing i followed all the directions and it was delicious thank you
5,we love this recipe amazing
5,wow susan that is so rude to rate a recipe that you didnt even bother to try because you are some kind of lasagna snob if the recipe is beneath your standards just pass on by and find recipes more to your liking some of us are more interested in the food than in the tradition you use to make your lasagna
5,i was using a different lasagna recipe on this site but having tried this one theres no going back i made it exactly as stated but i used mild italian sausages out of their casings and a full package of smoked provolone this was one decadent cheesy saucy meaty lasagna and i have had nothing but rave reviews from friends and family and requests to please make this again best ever
5,took a huge chance and made this for the first time for our christmas dinner and it was wonderful it looked intimidating with such a long list of ingredients but it went seamlessly i was also afraid it had too much cheese in it but i couldnt and wouldnt change a thing a keeper for sure
5,best i have ever ever had soooooo good
5,best ever
5,this is the best lasagna ever i dont use pork sausage i just add a few fennel seeds to my sauce to give a little sausage flavor
5,awesome base recipe i didnt have provolone so just used extra mozzarella will try provolone next time i also added mushrooms and an onion this was so yummy
5,absolutely the best lasagne i have ever eaten hands down will never make another recipetruly fantastic
5,i have made this recipe since it appeared years ago it is absolutely the best no matter what the negative reviews say just try it and make it exactly as it is written i was skeptical but after making it the family loved it hands down and im a particular cook make it and try ityoure family will love it
5,this is my goto lasagna i really like the sauce i use mild italian sausage instead of bulk pork sausage and usually make a double recipe i save the extra to use on spaghetti its a great recipe for entertaining i make all the components ahead and just assemble and bake
5,really great traditional recipe exactly what you need when you want a true down home lasagna recipe
5,finally i have an amazing lasagna recipe made this just recently and everyone raved i had leftovers the next day and it even tasted better and emily im sorry but you had to do something wrong to give it negative reviews
5,i have been making this recipe for years yearround it cant be beat when i dont have ricotta its still wonderful
5,made this today for all of my familyeveryone loved it thanks for sharing the recipe
5,made this yesterday i used oz pasta sauce with basil instead of plain tomato sauce i also added t oregano used nonboil lasagna assembled everything a day ahead and cooked it minutes and refrigerated it covered tightly the next day i warmed it minutes at and minutes at until the edges bubbled a bit it was a huge hit next time i will use real mozzarella cheese and shred it myself but this time i didnt have the energy for that i think it will make it a star if it has real cheese instead of the prepacked shredded cheese which has fillers this photo is a bit deceptive my pan was filled to the top
5,made this last week it was the best lasagna i have ever made so said hubby only changes i made was to use italian sausage instead of the pork and no boil noodles i did add about a cup of water to the sauce to provide enough moisture for the noodles the recipe is a keeper yes it takes longer to cook but so worth the effort
5,this has to be the best lasagna i have ever had only thing i changed is i used lb hot italian sausage and lb gr beef amazing flavors i love the provolone in this this is my first time not popping a jar for the sauce and i will never go back thank you for sharing this recipe
5,this will be my go to lasagna from now on perfect served it christmas eve to rave reviews from family and friends
5,one of the best lasagnas ive had i changed the beef and pork to only italian sausage it was delicious
5,love love love this recipe it is so delicious everyone raves over it will never make another lasagna recipeever
5,yes must agree one of the best i have ever tried did leave out the cottage cheese though added extra ricotta instead delicious
5,this is wonderful the addition of provolone cheese make it
5,i am a terrible cook and i found this to be easy and delicious i would definitely recommend it
5,my husband made this lasagna last night and it was so delicious and by far the best lasagna we have ever eaten other recipes dont even come close we have young children who all raved over it and our daughter even brought some to school in her thermos for lunch it made plenty for a family of still have a few pieces left over but they wont make it till the end of the day my husband ate pieces for dinner on his own grab some italian bread and make this recipe youll be so happy you did yummy stars
5,this recipe is very similar to one called my famous cheesy heavyduty lasagna the one difference is the meat i used lbs ground chuck and lb bulk italian pork sausage with diced onion added to the meats then drained off the grease i also used oz cans hunts tomato sauce and oz can tomato paste i used tsp of italian seasoning and tsp salt for the cheese i used a oz block of mozzarellashredded by hand instead of the oz in the recipe i also added a pkg of kraft italian cheese finely grated to the top when it is uncovered i baked at degrees for minutes then uncovered and baked minutes more with the added cheese this is a very good lasagna recipe but be sure to bake in a lasagna pan as it does not fit into a x pan
5,i made this for my husbands birthday and the family loved it my sonsinlaw wanted seconds and some to take home i made two recipes worth so that i could do that im thankful that the note said that the pan would be full i was concerned but it fit and there was no boil over i especially enjoyed the layer of provolone cheese that was something i had not seen in any other recipe
5,this recipe is very good added a few ingredients to this recipe i added cup of fried fennel cup of caramelized onion a pound if fried muhrooms and some extra virgin olive oil and oz cans of fire roasted dice tomatoes i only used one small can of tomato pasteturned out excellent with a very zesty taste to the sauce yum
5,this is the best lasagna i have ever eaten it took a little time to put together but it was worth every minute to assemble
5,made this for my sons soccer team and again for a dinner party with my husbands work colleagues and both times i received rave reviews for this dish even my picky year old loved this lasagna this will be my goto recipe for lasagna
5,this lasagna is really yummy i substituted spicy italian sausage and a bottle of garlic meat tomato sauce instead of plain tomato sauce as well as italian flavored tomato paste since i dont have italian seasoning one thing that i blundered on was the garlic ive never cooked with garlic before so i accidently put whole garlic bulbs instead of cloves so it was very garlicy still yummy though and would be x better with the recipe amount im on my mobile and the star selection is acting up so in case it doesnt say this stars for this lasagna
5,very good lasagna i used ground turkey instead of hamburger and could not tell the difference i missed the ricotta cheese but the recipe was quite good without it my x pan was full without the ricotta i also had cups of extra sauce left over
5,okay so i substituted garlic for the powder and also the beef for ground turkey and instead of spicy sausage i used mild and it was great well the meat sauce i have my lasagna in the ovenext right now but im sure itll be great
5,pi absolutely love it ive made this the first time with beef and mild italian sausage this time i used ground turkey and mild italian sausage i actuallu think i liked it better this timeand i normally hate ground turkey i did tweek it though instead of mozzarella and provolone i use a or cheese italian blend i also use sharp jack and colby i use ounces of ricotta and two eggs instead of three today i added a little chicken broth to loosen it up a bit it wasnt soupy the seasonings i changed up a bit too in addition to italian i used a complete sazon seasoning and adobo classico traditional sause and diced tomatoes with oregano and basil i sauteed garlic and shallots i love love love the cottage cheese it gives the ricotta a little kick i must now use that cheese mixture in some homemade ravioli yummmmp
5,ive made this lasagna several times now love it last night i served it to my dinner guests and even the person who said he hated lasagna ate a great big helping this really does make a lot so i suggest that you use a nice deep lasagna pan i made some simple additions to suit our tastes a half cup of diced onions sauteed with the meat a ounce jar of sliced mushrooms drained and i increased the sausage to one pound i also increased the tomato sauce to ounces extra mozzarella on every layer perfecto helpful hints add the top layer of cheese after you uncover the lasagna so it doesnt stick to the foil and in response to several questions about the sausage recommendations are to use ground italian sausage not pork breakfast sausage or sausage links i made the mistake of using pork breakfast sausage the first time i made this and the taste totally overwhelmed it yikes
5,always a hit with this recipe it also freezes well
5,how do you freeze this cooked or uncooked
5,yummy my family requests this at least once a month if not twice love it
5,ive made at least different versions of lasagna this is hands down the best by far i followed the recipe
5,this lasagna was awesome if you are a cheese lover this is the recipe for you i added chopped onion and mushrooms in and let them saute with the meat because i like more than just meat in my sauce and the flavor was to die for hands down best lasagna i have ever made
5,this is hands down the best lasagna ive ever tried my family is crazy about it wonderful recipe
5,best lasagna ever
5,yum perfect recipe thank you this was my first lasanga attempt your recipe was flawless
5,ex
5,made this for my date this weekend and it was amazing he doesnt eat red meat so i replaced the ground beef with morning star crumbles and replaced the pork sausage with morningstar farms original sausage bought all horizon cheeses and made it completely humane animals used in recipe were organically fed free range and humanely slaughtered it was delicious
5,best ever pauline nova scotia
5,ive been making this recipe for years amp i always get request for the recipe i found a cheese maker that makes extra sharp provolone cheeseif you can find it its well worth using in this recipe it gives it sharper bite amp tang you dont get with regular provolone
5,i hadnt made lasagna in a very long time so i decided to look up a recipe i tried this one and it came out excellent based on the other reviews i did add lbs of meat i used ground turkey instead of beef instead of lb and therefore used twice the amount of tomato sauce to compensate for the extra meat i also used a deeper pan and made layers instead of two everyone thought it was delicious and i will definitely make it again thanks
5,this is the best lasagna i have ever had i use the no cook noodles and its great
5,i had doubts that this was going to turn out because the sauce ended up very thick it was almost like a paste and i wasnt even able to simmer it for the whole hour because i was afraid it was going to burn however the lasagna still tasted excellent even with the very thick sauce i think the next time i will maybe use a can of diced tomatoes in place of one of the cans of sauce also i would wait to add the last layer of mozzarella cheese until after you uncover it because most of the top layer of cheese ended up on the foil when i removed it i also used the nocook noodles for this and they came out great
5,made it for canada day my guests loved it
5,best i ever made or ate
5,this is still a star having it for christmas dinner this year per family request
5,this was super good and easy this was the first recipe ive used to make a chicken pot pie and its a keeper however the second time i made this i used only one crust and made more of the brothgravy mixture i froze this one to cook later i followed the how to cook the frozen pie instructions but my pie was still cold after it shouldve been ready it took an additional minutes and i increased the oven temperature it was still tasty just disappointed it took a long time too cook through
5,made it for dinner tonight delicious my family loved
5,fantastic so good dont get to freeze the second pie
5,this was delicious and satisfying i used my own crust recipie so i could make one large pie instead of two total hit and my family loved it great comfort food
5,really filling i added some dill and parsley flakes for some more flavor and i added some poultry seasoning to the broth for a little chicken flavor boost baked pie came out wonderful second pie into the freezer hope to enjoy that next month
5,my husband told me this recipe was a keeper and i cant take the leftovers to work i am really glad i picked this recipe to try we loved it
5,this recipe was perfection my husband could not say enough good things about it he said now this is what a chicken pot pie should taste like i followed the recipe exactly i did use yukon gold potatoes instead of a regular baking potato at first i thought i would cut the recipe in half as i didnt think i needed two pies worth but i am so glad i went ahead and made both the chopping is a bit time consuming so i am glad that now i will get two meals out of this one night of work i put the other pie in the freezer for the future and cannot wait to have it for a simple meal a few weeks from now loved this
5,fantastic my whole family loved the flavor definitely a keeper
5,this was delicious and i turned it vegan substituted soy milk and soy butter faux chicken strips but essentially the same i did put a little more pepper and salt in to counteract the sweetness of the soy milk in any case it was a huge hit b
5,i know this may seem crazy to ask but when it says poor the potatoe mixture in is it talking about the water you cook the potatoes in
5,this was wonderfulperfect combination of ingredients and very flavorful it does take a while to put together but a lot can be done ahead eg cook and freeze individual bags of chicken to have on hand to save time i just bought packaged veggies and added the chicken and potato my husband loved it
5,you will never make another chicken pot pie after making this one it is well worth the effort if using frozen pie shells like the tenderflake i find i can get three pies out of this recipe i also add chopped parsnips with the carrots and then cut down on the frozen veggies the richness of the sauce is just incredible even my one year old eats an entire piece
5,good chicken pie i wasnt sure i had frozen peas and didnt want to dig through the deep freeze to see if i could find any so i substituted frozen chopped broccoli so there would be some green in it i was going to make my own pie crust but decided not to bother because i had some biscuit mix so i mixed some up and dropped biscuits over the top of the casserole i cut down on the thyme added maybe an eight of a teaspoon since i dont like things too heavily seasoned also i halved everything as i just wanted one pie delish will make again and next time will probably make a pie crust from scratch when im not as rushed for time another thingi dont think it needs a bottom crust just one over the top
5,every one enjoyed found recipe very easy also liked they told you wine to serve
5,ive been making lasagna for over years for my family but decided to update the taste and ran across this recipe in taste of home a couple years ago i use this recipe exclusively now its very meaty with the beef and pork and that is the best combination the seasoning and combination of cheeses is perfect i had my doubts about the use of cottage cheese but it cooks down so there are no curds and keeps the lasagna from drying out i made this a number of times and it comes out perfect every time i call that foolproof
5,the best lasagna ive ever made or eaten a perfect from the whole family
5,this was fantastic i didnt add any salt but other than that i didnt change a thing
5,there were of us for dinner and we finished the entire pan dh asked if we could make it again in january we used sweet italian sausage a oz can of tomato sauce and an additional oz can of diced tomatoes we did have some sauce that wouldnt fit in the pan however so the extra sauce and tomatoes were probably not necessary well probably do it as written next time
5,oh my gosh is this good love the layer of provolone and this is the first time i made lasagna with both cottage and ricotta cheese i added a little more ricotta than the recipe calls for and it turned out sooooooo good this is my new lasagna recipe
5,i must say i was surprised how well this turned out every lasagna recipe ive ever tried always came out on the flavorless side but this recipe did not everyone was surprised that there was cottage cheese in the lasagna which i feel helps the taste granted i had to adjust the ingredients a little since a person in my family has sensitivities to what is in italian seasoning but a pepper and onion sausage and a little extra salt and sugar did the trick with the saucedefinitely a keeper
5,this was easy to make and so goodits a keeper
5,wonderful lasagna i too used oven ready lasagna perfect
5,this is absolutely delicious only change i did was use half cottage cheese and half ricotta of the total ounces of both
5,this is by far the best lasagna i have ever made and quite possibly the best ive ever eaten restaurants included one thing i really like about the recipe is the stepbystep layering directions they make it very easy to put this delicious dish together
5,the ricotta cheese is what makes this dish so fantastic i love to add additional shredded cheese however on the top delicious this also freezes well
5,i too have tried for years to get the perfect lasagna i found this one last winter and have been making it exactly as it says since i printed it off and laminated it i have been asked many times to share it i always have some in the freezer now it is so easy to freeze i wait until the next day and cut it to portion sizes and wrap them individual in saran and then place them in a ziplock bag in freezer i often share these portions with seniors and shutins
5,just began creating this dish ive never made lasagna by myself before so im hoping my dad and younger sisters enjoy this for dinner tonight did not have cottage cheese so i doubled up on ricotta also did not have provolone hopefully its still good
5,i am coming back online again to get this recipe i have tried other recipes over the years but always come back to this one when i am having company and want my lasagna to taste just right
5,i used lbs of hamburger lb of italian sausage and added an additional oz of tomato sauce my family loved it in fact my husband said this is the best dish ever will definitely make it again
5,perfect
5,i just followed the recipe as given and it was a big hit i might try a little more of the meat sauce next time
5,best lasagna in the world
5,my family loved this lasagna so so so good
5,ive made this delicious recipe before and am going to try making five trays of it this weekend for a big gathering this time im going to try ovenready lasagna noodles to save time keeping my fingers crossed that it will work has anyone else tried these noodles
5,loved it my boyfriend said it was the best lasagna hes ever had and thats saying something
5,i have a question do you remove the skins from the sausages or cook them whole or cut up
5,made this for dinner tonight it was awesome
5,made this for dinner last night i must say one of the best lasagna i have ever had or made followed the recipe with few changes added cup red wine to the sauce to make it a little more saucier and used no cook lasagna noodles the second time i made it had my in laws visiting so made it the day before and took it out of the fridge hours before baking still as awesome as the first time amp using the no cook lasagna noodles this is a keeper in my recipe bookthank you for sharing this wonderful recipe with all of usferryal
5,i usually go with jar sauce to save time but wanted to make an extra special dinner for family staying with me this recipe was awesome so good they could not stop bragging thank you taste of home
5,my husband and i really loved this lasagna the only change i will make is to cut down on the cheese
5,awesome recipe it is the only one i use now
5,wowdelicious made it for a party everyone loved it
5,yep as good as everyone says
5,by far the best lasagna ive ever eaten the whole family loved it takes some time to make but so worth it
5,best lasagna recipe that i have found
5,the best
5,this was a truly delicious lasagna i used hot italian sausage because my family likes a bit of kick in their meals but there is really nothing i would change about this recipe it is definitely a keeper
5,i made this yesterday because my inlaws were coming and everyone liked it a lot i didnt change anything except i used dried parsley instead of fresh didnt have fresh a definite keeper even my extremely picky yearold cleaned her plate
5,i first made this recipe for a new years day gathering of family amp friends in amp it was a hit with everyone i substituted cups of ragu traditional spaghetti sauce for the tomato sauce mixture in order to save time i also occasionally substitute sliced or bulk pepperoni for the bulk pork sausage we enjoy the variety of cheeses id never seen that before its a favorite
5,awesome quick and easy and very filling the taste is what made my family a lasagna lover
5,i made this for new years day dinner and it was a hit this will be my go to recipe for lasagna i had italian sausage so used that instead of the pork sausage and it turned out great
5,i added some v juice as needed to thin the sauce while it simmered for the hour i added onion green pepper fresh mushrooms bay leaf extra garlic and italian seasoning and towards the end of the hour some fresh basilto the layers i added one of fresh spinach i am so glad i found this recipe i have made it twice once with beef and sausage and once with beef and plain ground pork both were awesome thank you for this recipe
5,after years of trying to make my husband happy with lasagna i finally nailed it i didnt make the sauce sunce prego is our favorite i have made many home made sauces in my cooking career and we always go back to prego it saves time in the kitchen i used asiagoparmesan instead of just pamesan excellent
5,i first tried this recipe from my taste of home cookbook a few years back it has become a family favorite it really is easy to make and has such great flavor i make it a few times during the year especially during the cold winter months ive also tried it with jar sauce but its just not the same ive also used my own homemade sauce from cooking down tomatoes which is to die for i loaned my cookbook to my sil and have not gotten it back yet so im so glad its included in the online recipes my husband has been craving the best lasagna ever as he calls it hes so right definitely a star recipe
5,best lasagna recipe i have found i will definitely make this again
5,i have been making this recipe since it first came out in taste of home over a decade ago the only changes ive made over the years is to use a mix of hot amp sweet italian sausage plus i add about jar prepared sauce to thin sauce just a bit on occasion when i have extra fresh basil ill add with parsley to cheeseegg mixture i always receive rave compliments with this dish ps i make a double batch and freeze one for the future no better recipe
5,my go to lasagna dish so good no one has disliked it had to use all beef for some who can not eat pork and added saute onions
5,i made this tonight for my family my kids just loved it i had to make it gluten free with the no boil gluten free noodles i think next time i will only use ground beef though other than that this is a great recipe
5,this is my goto recipe ive been making it for years and its even my inlaw familys favorite and they are sicilian italian i usually do the beefsausage combo but i prefer just beef i always try to use all fresh ingredients including fresh mozzerella sometimes i will make it with just ricotta but its great both ways
5,this was absolutely delicious i added a touch of fine grated cheddar cheese with the mozzarella and used italian sausage served this dish for christmas as everyone was tired of ham and turkey my kids said this will be the new christmas tradition at our house
5,i made this for christmas dinner amp got so many compliments the only change i made was i used pound of italian sausage amp pound of ground beef so yummy the leftovers didnt last long you cant fail with this recipe i made it the day before amp let the flavors mingle overnight then baked it the next day
5,i really enjoyed this recipe i felt that that the combination of ingrediants were great however i was not happy with the sauce itself i felt it was a little overwhelming and i am interested in other peoples comments and suggestions about the sauce i just felt it was a little too thick and too overpowering
5,sooo yummy the sausage made for a wonderful flavor and i love how the sauce is simmered for an hour to get it nice and thick a lot of lasagna turns out wet and runny this one is perfect even my insanely picky husband liked it
5,it is everything i want in a lasagna everyone in my family loves it
5,i have not made this recipe but it sounds like a great way to make the cottage cheese mix in the lasagna stars for creativity i can not wait to make it for my family
5,great lasagna i used home made noodles for this dish super flavor and not difficult to prepare will definitely have again
5,excellent recipe and easy to make shared it with friends and they were amazed and said this is what i call a real lasagna recipe of course i will continue making it thumbs up
5,excellent i cut out the sausage and used all ground beef this turned out perfect
5,the very best i used ground beef and sausage also added c water and used t garlic powder instead of cloves not a garlic fan no changes necessaryjust my taste my dinner guests agreed its the best ever once cut it stays in layers nicely too
5,this was a great recipe it was easy to make and came out soooo good everyone loved it next time ill use hot sausage instead of sweet the sauce was tasty and it was the perfect amount of ricotta definitely let the sauce cook for an hour or more it makes a huge difference
5,i had not made lasagna in a while and saw this recipe i am so glad i did its easy and heartily delicious i will definitely make this again
5,simply delicious everyone loved it
5,we loved this recipe it turned out beautiful the only thing i did different was i didnt simmer the sauce for min instead i simmered it for min also during the browning process i only did it for min instead of im planning on making this for my parents this weekend thanks so much for the recipe
5,this is very good the only tweak i made was to add minced onions and a bay leaf to the meat sauce perfection
5,everyone in my family loved this recipethis is a keeper
5,i loved this recipe i think it may be my go to lasagna recipe from now on i used pound of pork sausage dried parsley and only simmered the pasta sauce for minutes i recommend using a lasagna pan for this recipe as the x is too small
5,i used all ground beef instead of part pork sausageand we loved it seems ive been a short order cook around here with picky requests from kids but my seven and four year old oohed and ahhed over something this amazing made a batch for my inlaws who believed this was the best lasagna theyve tasted completely worth the effort and extra time to put together will be making this again soon thanks so much for sharing this recipe
5,my husband loved this recipe i have never used provolone in lasagna before it was great we have tried adding torn spinach as one of the layers comes out great
5,this is my second rating of this recipe this time i left out the sausage and only used hamburger meat i loved it this way and got many great comments too i would have increased my star rating from to but website wont let me change my rating
5,the best lasagna i have ever had i did use italian sausage instead of plain but that was the only change i made so good
5,i add a few more seasonings but this is excellent
5,this recipe is by far the best lasagna ive eatten and im not much of a lasagna person i made the recipe asis the first time and the second time i tweaked it for a healthier version no meat so no simmering of the sauce ahead of time reducedfat ricotta cheese reduced fat provolone and a mix of mozzarella and regular shredded mozzarella it still tasted fantastic definitely making this again
5,excellent i used itaillan sausage and ratio of cottage amp ricotta everybody loves
5,hello lorri thank you so much for such a wonderful flavorful and tasty lasagna this is the best recipe its so good that i decided to make it for people for my husbands customer appreciation night wow what was i thinking ha the lasagna was a big hit but i learned my lesson if i dont have a double oven which i dont and have a couple of friends to help me ill never attempt it again i ended up making pans whew but it was all good thanks again
5,this recipe is delicious my whole family loved it
5,i have made this several times and always get tons of compliments sauce is delicious
5,so delicious no other lasagna even comes close to this one
5,i have made this lasagna several times and always get great reviews i use venison meat instead of beef simply because it is what we have on hand
5,i have made this lasagna for years no other lasagna compares to this one i follow the recipe to the letter every time and it turns out perfectly every time
5,i love this lasagna just love it so does everyone else in my family
5,three people in my family found this recipe at around the same time the entire family agrees that this is the best lasagna recipe available i dont know that it would be considered a traditional lasagna by italian standards but we do not care it is our favorite easy to prepare and has the best of all lasagna recipes included in the ingredients i tend to add my own touches to recipes as i make them but not with this oneno improvements needed
5,awesome lasagna that makes even better leftovers well worth the time amp effort

5,this was a huge hit this is the best lasagna recipe
5,wow this will be my lasagna recipe that i will always use so good
5,the prep time on this dish was a little more than i expected i will admit that i didnt read the recipe closely at first but the lasagna was worth the wait its a mild flavored dish sure not to offend anyone we enjoyed it but ill probably add spinach and mushrooms next time to add a little more interest all in all its definitely something id serve to the inlaws
5,the meat sauce ended up very thick but still delicious i left out the provolone and used dried parsley instead of fresh also i used an aluminum lasagna pan so overflow wasnt a problem
5,before trying this recipe i have always made the same family recipe i had watched my parents make for years i never have liked many other recipeswell i saw how popular this recipe is here so i tried it amazingly good i am afraid to tell my parents for fear of hurting their feelings the only thing i did differently because of lack of exact ingredients was to substitute pizza sauce for the tomato sauce and replaced the italian seasoning with a mixture of basil and oregano it was the best lasagna i have ever eaten i will probably cut back on the sauce a bit next time this lasagna is everything everyone says it is perfecto
5,made this for my neighbors and they swore it was the best lasagna that they have ever had
5,i have made this lasagne many timesit is wonderful but not everyone likes sausagei replaced the sausage with ground pork and it was excellent

5,this is an excellent recipe this is also the first successful lasagna recipe that i have made my guy absolutely loved it the only thing i did was double the sauce and the amount of mozarella there was plenty of sauce left over to make a small lasagna or to use for spaghetti sauce
5,great lasagna one of the bestif not the best
5,delicious this recipe is great and easy the only thing i had to change was the cooking time since i made it earlier in the day it had been in the refrigerator so i took longer than the minutes to cook so just make sure you adjust your cooking time if needed but a really delicious recipe
5,my boyfriend always orders lasagna from the olive garden this recipe was a big hit with him he thought it was better than the olive garden very delicious
5,this was the best lasagna i have ever made it was wonderful i had family over for dinner and they loved it
5,this is a fantastic lasagna i used a foil pan so it wouldnt spill on the way to my inlaws it did not dry out at all i would make this again
5,this is a family favorite i dont like chunks of tomatoes so this is a winner sometimes i add pepperoni as well
5,this was the lasagna recipe that i have been looking for great flavor and cheesy this recipe is a winner yes it is a blue ribbon contest winner i use hot italian and mild italian sausage for the port sausage so good
5,the is the best lasagne recipe ever i had my family over and wanted to try a new recipe that would feed a large group lots of compliments and asking where i got the recipe really easy but kind of long process to make followed the recipe exactly as written will definately make this one againsoon
5,i love lasagne
5,love it love it and love it i took this lasagna to a pot luck and it was the hit of the night i didnt change a thing
5,every time i have dinner guests this is my goto recipe if i have any left it also freezes well for later i also make mine in a larger pan to avoid overflow in my oven
5,this is the best lasagna recipe i have found its amazing
5,this is the best lasagna i have ever made i didnt have any pork sausage meat so i used ground pork this is the recipe i will always make
5,this is the best lasagna recipe i have ever had i will not make anything else make sure you put a piece of foil or a cookie sheet under the baking dish because this is filled to the brim and tends to overflow
5,i tried this recipe yesterday for dinner my husband and family said it was delicious maybe the best lasagna he has eaten
5,delicious i added chopped zucchini green peppers and mushrooms to the sauce
5,it was amazing my whole family loved it and my yr old ask if we could have it every day
5,this was the first lasagna recipe ive ever made i lbs of ground chuck instead of ground beef and pork sausage and it turned out great wonderful recipe
5,ive made this many times its fantastic
5,i made this lasagna for a small family gettogether it was really good but it is not a throwtogetheratthelastminute recipe but i would definitely make it again
5,great recipe
5,i make this lasagna on special occasions two or three times a year and every time i make it i get rave reviews it takes patience but its well worth it also the recipe freezes well i put mine in an x pan because its too much for a x
5,i made this recipe for a family gettogether everyone said it was fantastic and i even got phone calls the next day about it i followed the recipe exactly as i wanted to see what id change not a thing ill never make another recipe after this it takes extra time but its well worth it
5,this is the best lasagna recipe i have come acrossi have modified it a bit when i make it i only use one can of tomato paste i feel that when you use two it has too much of a metallic taste especially when eating leftovers and it also makes the sauce too thick and reheated leftovers are too dry i also use slightly more tomato sauce and use two oz cans of sauce i am not a huge sausage fan so i usually omit the sausage and just use the lb of beef
5,i have made this a number of times this is the best lasagna recipe i have come across so far i have been making this recipe for years
5,i made this for dinner tonight and it was excellen
5,this has been our favorite lasagna recipe for years
5,dear lorrithank you for this recipe i have made it every christmas eve for our family gettogether ever since it was first published in taste of home magazine everyone loves it and i love getting kudos for making itdebbie b
5,i made this for the second time yesterday for my boyfriend and his roommates everyone loved it it is by far my favorite lasagna recipie
5,love this recipe it has become a constant go to and the family loves it
5,never made lasagna b this one reminded me of ones i grew up on i leave the sausage out and use premade spaghetti sauce tastes amazing everyone loves it its a crowd pleaser
5,my entire family uses this recipe anytime that lasagna is craved we all discovered this recipe several years ago and stopped looking for any other lasagna recipe the only thing we look for now is to see which one of us is going to prepare the dish next love it
5,this is the best lasagna recipe i have found the meat sauce and cheeses compliment each other very well
5,amazingly good my family prefers this recipe over my italianborn motherinlaws
5,very tasty not hard to make i used the kind of noodles you dont need to boil before baking good for one less step
5,this recipe really is as fabulous as everyone says wanted to make vegetarian lasagna for my neighbor so substituted the meat for boca crumbles and boca sausage crumbled i love meat and i never would have known that it was vegetarian the flavor and textures were amazing truly the perfect lasagna
5,my absolute favorite i usually make a double batch to freeze one pan for later
5,my family loved this recipe
5,i have made this recipe for several holiday meals and also on sunday meals i get many compliments and it is the best lasagna recipe i have ever made my husband always orders lasagna when we eat out and he said this recipe tops them all
5,my friends and i agree that by far this is the best lasagna we have ever had i double the recipe and make them two at a time they freeze well uncooked
5,this recipe is by far the best that i have ever used i dont think i will ever use another lasagna recipe again
5,absolutely delicious
5,very tasty sautéed veggies in evoo and added onion and garlic added a little paprika and dry mustard pressure cooked everything non dairy for minutes and a min natural release made the roux according to directions and folded it in total hit next time i think i may add a splash of white wine or sherry and a potato
5,i made this recipe exactly as recipe said i tasted it and it was really really good i husband wanted cauliflower soup and this was the best dont leave out the celery because that really adds a lot of flavor i am on a kick of using almond milk because its healthier than cream or half and half and it can stay in my fridge for months whereas milk products need to be used the almond milk tastes no different the only thing i noticed was that it made so little soup so my review already said the recipe as stated is very goodbut i added potatoes cooked drained and mashed with a little butter and added to the soup with cups of water and t soup base and more cup of cheesewhen i go to the work of making a soup i want more than just a couple meals for the of us
5,i make this soup every winter it is one of my husband amp mine favorite i try to use also low fat cheddar or sharp cheese to cut more fat i also use sodium reduce better than bouillon if i have broccoli leftover from a prior dinner or have fresh will add it too
5,excellent recipe i added bacon bits and now it tastes like loaded baked potato in soup form
5,i added bacon bits chili flakes and tsp franks hot sauce turned out delicious with so much flavouri also mashed the caulflower before adding the cheese sauce definitely recommend this recipe yummmm
5,dont let the name fool you this is terrific even though it is cauliflower instead of potato this soup is very tasty and easy to prepare i made it for christmas dinner and was told by multiple guests that they loved it too
5,simple amp excellent recipe i see a lot of comments saying it was bland i definitely disagree i know it says hot pepper sauce optional i would add it for sure i used franks red hot
5,this is one of those comforting cozy kind of soups my family and i were very sick with covid a few months ago i was staying with my month old grandson because my daughter and her husband were in the hospital having my granddaughter and due to some complications on top of them also having covid i was with him for almost a week many people dropped off meals and groceries for us i was so nauseated with the sickness and couldnt eat much of anything my soninlaws mom made this for me using almond milk and it very much hit the spot it is literally all i could eat for days i have made it exactly as written and it was delicious with both milks
5,ive been making this soup for several years now i have added a chopped onion and a whole rotisserie chicken cut into bite sized pieces with the added ingredients i increase the water to at least cups i do like the idea of adding red pepper flakes for added flavor my family loves this recipe
5,this is a nice tasting cauliflower soup i really liked it and will make again
5,my granny god bless her use to serve this up to me decades ago and said its a poor mans soup i made it myself today and was surprised how it tasted exactly the same as my granny made i also added whatever i had and put some sharp tasting parmesan cheese with the other shredded cheese i had and the taste was spectacular
5,palways looking for a healthy soup that will be suitable for my glutenfree friend and my diabetic friend this was a winner easy to make hardest part was breaking up the cauliflower and delicious p
5,this is a keeper i couldnt decide whether to use vegetable vs chicken bouillon so did tsp of each the tsp of hot sauce is not optional in my opinion its a must and no it doesnt make it spicy at all i also added maybe an tsp dry mustard to give it that background kick like in beer cheese soup cup diced onion and cloves crushed garlic into the veggies i used sharp cheddar for the most flavor amp it came out perfect normally im always adding extra salt or bouillon to most soups but didnt need to with this one it was plenty thick without blending any of the veggies
5,my boys loved this i omitted the milk in the filling because there seemed to be plenty of liquid already
5,i absolutely loved this i made it for my family and although it took a while it was worth it i used a rotisserie chicken from albertsons and just used the chicken breasts instead of canned or fresh chicken stock i used chicken bouillon i also used a bottom and top biscuit crust biscuit crust recipe to keep the crust from getting soggy i baked the bottom crust for about minutes before adding the filling it only needed to bake for minutes
5,this was great actually made it twice in one week first time i only made the recipe because it is only me and my younger son it was gone by the next morning today i made the full recipe i am working all weekend and wanted something here for him easy to heat up the only variations i made were using tsp of pepper instead of and fresh thyme instead of dried try it
5,this is the best chicken potpie my kids would never eat potpie now they ask for it
5,really good def the best pot pie i have ever had i am a vegetarian so i swapped out the chicken for mushrooms and the chicken broth for vegetable broth amazing thank you great end of work weekfriday night comfort food meal
5,flavor was perfection
5,this is a really good recipe my husband absolutely loved it and so did my boys you have got to try it
5,this is an extremely delicious recipe my husband ate an entire pie to himself in one day for breakfast lunch and dinner i am currently going to the market now to gather the ingredients to make more a major hit in my household
5,i made this last night and my family was wowed it is hearty and tasty and for my large family we are always having to double recipes this one made plenty for dinner and for lunch leftovers it totally hits the spot when you are looking for a fall comfort food recipe
5,i loved this recipe only made one chicken potpie and saved the rest to serve over mashed potatoes very tasty
5,this recipe is fantastic i made this as written but for one pie i used the breast meat from a costco chicken and a bag of mixed vegetables to make it easier i am going to make the filling again tomorrow and will toss it into the freezer for busy days
5,this was a super recipe very tasty even my picky yr old wanted morei just have to work on perfecting my pie crust
5,this is great i made my own crust and it was much better i also used our leftover turkey from thanksgiving which is now becoming a tradition that the whole family loves much better than turkey sandwiches every day for a weeki cut back on the butter by half and used sour cream in lieu of milk as we never seem to have milk in our house it turned out great its hard to find a recipe that produces a thicker pie versus a thin one i will always use this recipe from now on
5,this is a fantastic recipe it is one of my goto recipes when making a meal for a friend i can make one and have an extra to take to someone or leave in the freezer for a busy night
5,i made this last night and my family absolutely loved it it was the first time my kids ever had chicken pot pie i used mix vegetables instead of the carrots and peas separate and added celery salt i made pies and it was all gone in min great recipe after that my wife wants me to cook every night
5,added garlic serrano pepper broccoli and an extra cup of cheese also find that cooking the veggies makes them too mushy cut the time in half i have made this a dozen times at least and just keep tweaking to my tastes of course everyone is different but its a quick and inexpensive recipe so you can really just keep experimenting thank you for the recipe
5,easy recipe made a great hearty flavorful soup i will definitely make again
5,this was such an easy recipe and simply delicious i adjusted all measurements by half and it was just right for serving of us i also used vegetable broth instead of water will be using this recipe again and again
5,whole family enjoyed this soup
5,im glad i read the review of course i used what everyone before me did i sautéed onion garlic serrano pepper carrots and cauliflower then i added the liquids tasted fantastic
5,liz i made it last night and used almond milk my husband loved it
5,this is absolutely my favorite kids think its bland but i love it i did add the hot sauce and put more in than required so good
5,everyone who has had this enjoys it
5,i just made this soup and it is absolutely delicious made one change used vegetable broth instead of water to cook the vegetables it was so good i subscribed to the magazine
5,i made this tonight i also chopped up an onion with the other veggies it just feels wrong to cook without onions i sautéed the veggies a little bit with olive oil and epicure rosemary garlic seasoning then added in chicken broth instead of the water to finish i added in some buffalo hot sauce so good i will be making this again thanks for the recipe
5,i really liked this recipe and so did most of my family i did make a few minor changes however first i sauteed onion in olive oil added the shredded carrot and cauliflower florets and sauteed for a few minutes with the onion then i added chicken stock instead of water after i added the cheese sauce to the cauliflower i used my immersion blender to make a more creamy thick soup i have bookmarked this soup and will definitely make it again
5,this is a really good base recipe good as is but you can customize to come up with something that is perfect for your taste i threw in a handful of smoked salmon just before serving and also ran half of it through the blender just to thicken a bit more salmon really kicked it up a notch i always follow a recipe the first time and go from there
5,made it and he loveditthis is a very good soup
5,im just reading the email for this recipe sounds great but can someone please tell about the cheese mentioned in the instructions but not ingredients thanks
5,it was very good only thing is it got real thick what did i do wrong
5,my husband who doesnt like cauliflower loved this recipe it is delicious
5,this is so good it is always requested in our house the only changes i use broth instead of water add cup chopped onion to the carrot mixture and cayenne instead of hot sauce yum
5,i use broth instead of water and double recioe so i can freeze for later so good
5,absolutely deeeelicious and super easy
5,make this times a year i do add chopped onion cup of chopped celery what do i do with the rest of the celery stalk lol i think adding one celery stalk to the soup will be just fine maybe even more
5,hubby pronounced this very good even though he is not a soup lover i did add a chopped onion and because the head of cauliflower was quite large i added some extra celery and extra carrot i used skim milk and added bergeron cheese instead of cheddar because thats what was in the fridge this one goes into my good enough to serve to company recipe file
5,i made this over the weekend because it was chilly out and really wanted a nice soup made as stated in the recipe but i think next time i will add some sautéed onions to it i did use my potato masher to break up the cauliflower into smaller pieces will definitely make again
5,this is the best soup took to work and everyone wanted the recipe
5,made this tonight for the first time my husband and i loved it and my and year old too i did add cup diced onion as others suggested i would imagine you could use this same base for broccoli or potato soup too
5,made it today roommates raved have to try it again wonions love your recipes
5,i made this today having my daughter amp grands over for lunch its so tasty i did add sautéed onions amp garlic amp of a hot pepper from the garden and then thinly sliced crimini mushrooms ill come back after lunch with a family update oh and this was my very first time making a rue and it was successful yay
5,i love this recipe i just tweak it a little bit by adding some chopped onion and some fresh minced garlic thanks taste of home
5,this is now one of my favorite soups i always add a small can of green chilies in place of the hot sauce

5,this has been a family favourite for many years so quick and easy to make
5,great recipe quick to make and delicious
5,this soup was delicious and so quick and easy to make i didnt have any soup stock on hand so i just used water and added a bunch of extra seasonings poultry seasoning garlic cayenne paprika etc right at the beginning it worked out really well and my whole family was happy with it
5,i love this recipe
5,good taste nice and easy to follow instruction even for non chefs
5,they make the soup about once a month its my favorite soup
5,such an easy recipe and very healthy i added garlic and onions used c chicken broth instead of water and excluded the chickenvegetable bouillon
5,this soup is so good i did use an emulsion blender to make chunks smaller my husband loved it
5,i made this exactly as written except i subbed herb
5,yummy and a success with the family used milk and added some lentils to thicken increased pepper as had no chilli oil added crushed coriander seeds cos i like them left out flour and would leave out butter next time gave each bowl a tiny bit of vintage cheddar so reduced fat used vegetarian oxo used this recipe to use up left over cooked cauliflower from sunday lunch really lovely will make again x
5,great recipe easy and quick and result is homely and delicious
5,the easy recipe combined satisfying vegetable flavors in a light cheesy base i measured my ingredients using cups cauliflower including some sliced stem pieces cup carrot cup celery stalk and chicken cubes watch the cooking time for veggies to avoid mushy texture i cooked mine minutes and thought cauliflower was a bit too soft have cheese sauce ingredients measured and ready once the pot of vegges are truned on this goes together quickly i l enjoyed this soup because the recipe only used one cup of cheese the calories were lower and it avoided a thick gluelike soup serves as a main dish they will want more
5,absolutely delicious and so easy to make this is a home run
5,loved this soup i roasted the cauliflower in olive oil with a shallot and a sweet green pepper for about minute also used a very small amount of slab bacon sauteed with the cut up stems and leaves of the cauliflower after roasting i put the veggies in the pot with the broth
5,made it as stated it was amazing my husband said please make that again
5,wow this soup was wonderful so easy to put together and good flavour the only things i did differently were to put a ¼ tsp of crushed red pepper flakes in instead of the hot sauce and i chopped the vegetables fine with my hand blender after they were cooked and then added the milk mixture this recipe went into my keep file
5,i make this all the time it is delicious you can substituteadd broccoli brussel sprouts asparagus cabbage i always add a bit of finely minced red bell pepper with the veggies and i brown garlic and onions with the butteroil it takes it to another level i also fry bacon or add chunks of ham to the soup so good
5,i made this and its a hit add a loaf of semolina bread and its an awesome meal
5,we had a snowstorm in michigan today this comfort food really hit the spot and has great flavor my husband and son didnt know they were eating cauliflower i will definitely be making this again thank you
5,i want this soup everyday
5,susan dont add the tsp of salt and use lowsodium chicken broth if you are used to no salt this shouldnt be a problem for you sometimes lemon or a splash of vinegar will help use sharp cheddar instead of mild cheese for a bit more tang
5,mom and kid approved recipe was so easy and ingredients wont break the bank the only tweeks i made were to omit the hot sauce and add tsp red pepper flakes at the end i used an immersion blender to make it more soupy daughter told me i should make it every night and at only calories per serving this recipe is a winner
5,i love this soup but how are you getting quarts out of cups of liquid
5,this is such a great recipe because its mostly ingredients i keep instock its easy its delicious this one is worth saving and sharing
5,i have made this recipe twice my broth was not thin at all i took a couple of couple of cups and pureed then made sure the roux was thick when i added it to the broth my soup is really really creamy and i followed the recipe exactlythe first time the second batch i added a can of chopped green chilies just because i like them oh and i didnt add the carrots because i dont like carrots this recipe is one i will fix frequently i even tricked my husband into thinking it was baked potato soup he loved it
5,so delicious on a winter day i added broccoli and corn thank you debbie for sharing this recipe
5,relatively easy to make and very good its not a heavy cream soup flavor gets better a day or two after its made

5,i added more celery and cheese also added onions coarsely mashed excellent
5,love this soup i just added a bit of shredded onion and coarsely mashed the cauliflower thank you
5,outstanding a new family favorite i did several things differently by accident i added tablespoons of chicken seasoning better than bullion instead of teaspoons knowing that would be salty i didnt add any extra salt i added tablespoons butter and flour instead of and still only used the cups of mile added a bit extra cheese and cooked it for about minutes loved it not bland at all
5,loved this soup easy to make will keep as a favorite soup recipe
5,made this soup and ate almost all of it myself because it taste fantastic
5,sounds so good but i am going to try boiling the vegs in some of the chicken broth using the broth as directed after draining it should give it a better flavor
5,made this last night everybody loved it i added another tsp of salt because what was called for in the recipe just wasnt enough this took the flavor from just ok to yummy and i was out of peas so i used cut green beans prep time took me a little longer than i expected but was worth it in the end because i get two pies out of the deal i also ran short on crust i had already used one crust for a pumpkin pie so i only had and needed so instead of fully covering both pies i just used cookie cutters on the rd crust and covered most of the surface of both pies with snowmen and gingerbread men shapes kids loved it filling comes out firm so it doesnt spill all over also even though boxed crust says to cook at i did what the recipe said and did for mins in gas oven and it was perfect this will be my go to chicken pot pie recipe
5,a win with my family my husband was tasting before it went in the oven and said it can be eaten just like thatthanks for sharing this recipe
5,wow this was phenomenal i actually ran out of allpurpose flour for the first time in my life i had to work with whole wheat flour i made my own crusthighly recommend and the filling was just perfect my husband said this was amazing my goto recipe was the allamerican turkey pot pie on toh but this one wins however i will continue to make the crust from the turkey recipeits to die for
5,this recipe was fantastic it took me one hour including the pastry dough i used chef ramsey quick puff pastry recipe my adjustments were i used baby potatoes with skin can of corn cup of peas and cup of vanilla almond milk i used an extra cup of chicken broth to compensate for the thickness of the almond milki did not use thyme or carrots because they are flavors my family does not enjoybon appetite
5,this recipe was absolutely wonderful i rolled my own crust so it took me a little longer my whole family loved it even my very picky soontobeyr old liked it and asked for more
5,omg what a recipe todiefor delicious i want to add a photo of my pie but there appears to be no manner in which to do so
5,this pie had rave reviews from my familyeveryone loved it my only change was that the sauce got a little too thick so i added more chicken stock came out perfect
5,great recipe i agree with the comments that a homemade crust would be even better i used pilsbury refrigerator pastry crust and it turned out pretty good very easy to pull together and the best part knowing there is another pie in the freezer
5,excellent thank you so much for this yummy recipe changes i made i only used cup of butter i added fresh asparagus i large diced and roasted the asparagus and the carrots together also added celery and sauted that with the onion one can of corn instead of frozen used cups of broth instead of i used half amp half instead of milk also used whole wheat flour as i was out of white flour very pleased we could not taste the difference in the flour and will use it again when making thismy husband said marie callenders a chain famous for their pies and pot pies should use this recipe thanks again

5,very good soup takes longer than minutes unless you already have the vegetables prepared i used one oz can of reducedsodium chicken broth vs bouillon and ended up including cups water with the broth with only the broth plus cup water there wasnt enough liquid for the vegetables to cook in i added tsp dried parsley tsp onion powder and tsp garlic powder but did not include the hot sauce the head of cauliflower was about lb and about cups of florets the finished soup was just a little over cups served with corn muffins yummy

5,fantastic recipe my family loved it
5,amazing perfect comfort food and finally a soup without onion and garlic i am currently months pregnant and have had an aversion to onions and garlic my entire pregnancytrying to find canned soup or a homemade soup recipe without these ingredients is like searching for the holy grail i made a couple of modificationsi used my immersion blender to puree some of the soup to make it thicker and add a silkier texture i also used crushed red pepper flakes to add some spice because franks hot sauce contains garlic powder
5,i dont normally post reviews but wow i did take what i thought was the best advice from the other reviewers but must give stars for the original recipe for getting me started i doubled the carrots and celery and used cups of low sodium chicken broth i also gave the cauliflower mixture a few shots with the immersion blender after doing so i added about oz of chopped cooked ham i used red pepper flakes instead of hot sauce i also cut down on the salt probably a bit less than tsp the final result was incredible kudos to the op
5,absolutely wonderful and healthy i used my basket from coop we picked up yesterday i changed by using x more celery and carrots and half low salt chicken stock i had on hand to thicken i used king arthur instant clear jel rather than flour and dropped the butter in pot the pepper flakes enhanced the flavorsthank you debbie
5,during yesterdays snowstorm i made this rich and creamy soup i use milk and had to use a little extra as the soup was too thick i also pureed the vegetables before adding the milk and cheese mixture serve with salad and fresh bread my husband lived it good thing i doubled the recipe
5,i just made this soup and just like moxier i tripled the celery and carrots and added onion and some button mushrooms it turned out awesomeits a great rue and soup starter for all cheesy milky soups good recipe
5,very flavorful i doubled the celery used low sodium chicken base added extra cup water and omitted salt ive never had cauliflower soup but this will go in my collection of soup favorites
5,easy amp delicious ive made it with cauliflower as the main ingredient and also combined cauliflower with broccoli very good each time goes great with any sort of sandwich
5,great super easy and quick i added additional chopped celery and carrots along with the chicken bouillon i used some boxed chicken broth in place of some of the water in equal amounts i increased all the ingredients to compensate for the added vegetables yum
5,excellent soup everyone in the family loved the soup even my year old who hates eating her vegetables i added quite a bit more of each of the vegetables and doubled the rest of the recipe definitely worth a try
5,great soup it was very thick and although i didnt mind it others commented so i added some more milk to thin it out
5,i made this on a sunday morning for lunch later on it smelled so good my yr old son had some for breakfast its a huge hit and i love how he is getting several servings of vegies and calcium the only thing i changed was i pureed about a cup of the cauliflower mixture before i added the milk cheese mixture it was awesome plus i love the fact that the recipe came from chilliwack my relatives all come from bc and i have spent many beautiful cool fall nights at cultus lake this soup is perfect for fall thanks debbie
5,delicious i prefer to use c chicken stock with half a cup of water to eliminate the msg from the bouillon
5,the best soup ive ever made it thicken up after it set awhile so next time ill add more milk or water i added cloves of garlic chopped and tsp tumeric which i put in everything since its so good for you and chopped up red pepper to add a little color i love this soup
5,this was a really good soup its hard not to double the recipe i omitted the red pepper sauce
5,omg what a delicious soup only made adjustments used sodiumfree chicken stock instead of water and bouillon also used a combo of american amp asiago cheese a little more than a cup next time gonna use broccoli
5,thank you i am a newly diagnosed diabetic finally i found something i like with low carbs i made it with almond milk bc my doctor wants me to switch from real milk to this stuff and it was still really good i am actually eating it right now for breakfast
5,wonderful recipe so delicious i added garlic onion and brussel sprouts to add some green to the soup next time i will also add chicken this was an easy recipe and perfect for fal season
5,wonderful recipe i like a chunkier soup so i doubled the veggies and steamed instead of boiled them and then added them when i combined the cheese sauce to the water i also blended about a head of cauliflower to make a creamier base had it with a side of soft boiled eggs for some protein and it was a wonderful dinner
5,excellent i knew with so many good reviews it had to be good amp wow made as written without ingredient changes but pured about cups mixture amp mixed back in to add texture as another reviewer noted will definitely make again easy amp wonderful
5,awesome i used velveeta cheese cause thats what i had hubby advised make it again enough for amp enough left to reheat again can increase carrot or celery but use extra bouillon amp water if you do
5,i have made this at least once a week for the last month i will tell you how i changed it just a bit and it is amazing i always use low sodium chicken broth i add some broccoli and zucchini and at the end i always pure at least to cups and it is simply the best soup i also double the recipe because in my household it disappears quickly oh and i always use reduced fat mexican mixed cheese like sargento bon appetite
5,very pleased with this soup i did doctor it up a bit added more cheese dried onion and some poultry seasoning will be making this again
5,comfort food without guilt i made one substitution no cheddar cheese in the fridge so i used asiago cheese wow a little more upscale taste nuance probably a better cheese to use when serving this soup to adult guests than for the children maybe i can image adding maybe a dash of nutmeg to this recipe
5,this is really good i usually make a potato soup similar but my husband has type diabetes this is a great alternative actually i think we like it better i wouldnt change a thing i serve it with crispy bacon and cheese on top
5,great soup used chicken stock and some vegetable stock instead of water also used half and half for the milk with flour makes thicker thanks for recipe
5,this soup is really good had to thicken it just a bit but it may have been that i added too much water i chose not to use the hot sauce and it was great on this very cold night this is a keeper
5,made this tonight and it was a big hit the whole family gave it stars my daughter said this recipe is a keeper
5,so it i decide to use chicken broth instead i dont use any water right
5,made this for dinner tonight it was awesome i added the hot sauce while cooking and a couple of dashes to my bowl the recipe worked perfectly is was quick and easy this is a keeper
5,easy to make creamy amp oh so good the only thing i added was a bit of onion great on a cold winter day
5,my goal this winter is to try one new soup recipe each week this one was very easy tasty and healthy this soup is low enough in carbs to be very good for anyone who is diabetic or counting carbs this is a quick meal while the vegetables are cooking i made the white sauce i used a vegetable base rather than bouillon to cut out the msg found in most bouillons i used tsp of hot sauce if you like a little spicier taste add the entire teaspoon definitely a keeper of a recipe
5,loved this easy to make i left out the hot sauce maybe next time i will try it with it but i really liked it with out so not sure
5,i love this soup it is so quick and easy and is always a hit i serve it whenever i have to whip up something healthy in a hurry have added corn on occasion as well yum i usually do biscuits or scones to go with this soup and rarely is there leftovers ive added this recipe to my huge list of favourite soups
5,i have made this soup several times we love it i have also substituted broccoli for the cauliflower we belong to a coop and sometimes we get cauliflowersometimes broccoli both are yummy in this soup
5,very simple and quick to make i omit the salt and use mild cheddar and sharp cheddar cheese so tasty
5,this was very good soup i used all boxed chicken broth in place of the water amp no chicken bouillon cube i added diced onion broccoli chopped pieces diced yukon gold potatoes amp garlic cloves i also used half amp half in place of the milk i was trying to copy a restaurants recipe this was very close amp the soup went quickly
5,one of the best soups ive ever made i added some fresh dilldelicious even my son who is not a soup lover loved this soup
5,my husband and i really liked this soup i added onion and i also thickened it with extra flourwater mixture at the end of cooking i didnt measure my cheese but im sure i went a little heavy on that too we added the hot sauce to our bowls and we liked it very much this recipe is a keeper
5,excellent
5,made this recipe for the first time tonight turned out great i did use chicken broth instead of bullion and water and blended the veggies up before adding the cheese sauce my picky and year olds devoured it will be making it again
5,both my husband and i loved this recipe i did add smoked paprika and a little more chicken broth also i used goats milk and part skim part skim mozzarella cheese as thats what i had on hand
5,my husband is not a fan of cauliflower but this recipe got a thumbs up from him for a little added protein i am going to add chicken he wants a touch of cayenne i plan to do both loved this soup
5,it was wonderful
5,ive just recently begun to cook and even the simplest things seem overwhelming for me this soup however was as simple as can be and turned out to be delicious i made it for my family and got some compliments even the fouryearold ate it
5,this is literally the best soup recipe ive ever made i keep making it freezing it remaking it im a big fan of onions so i choose to caramelize some onions in the main pan to add a little more of a flavor layer but its great with or without it make this soup
5,i used fat free chicken broth fat free cheddar cheese and fat free milk it was still fantastic
5,easy to make very filling and very good
5,this is a favorite of ours i do add a chopped onion just because we like it and if im in a rush i just chop the carrot
5,the girls all asked for seconds great way to get the veges in the base of the soup was great we sauted all the vegetables and added onion a yellow pepper doubled the celery parsley seasoning salt the girls recommended blending half and leaving half chucky would definetly make again
5,i was really impressed with this recipe it is very flavorful i followed the recipe exactly except used sriracha sauce because i did not have other hot sauce and i used milk instead of pleased with how it turned out and would make it again
5,this was awesome followed recipe to almost exactly except added more flour at the end mixed with cup milk to thicken a bit more my husband who has never eaten cauliflower thought it was great as well thanks for a great fast recipe
5,my sons favorite soup try with an orange cauliflower from farmers market its outstanding
5,i made this tonight it tastes great the consistency is perfect i used almond coconut milk instead of regular milk and cup butter instead of the full cup i would agree with the other reviews to use less thyme as i did not it is just a tad bit much if you use the whole teaspoon i plan on freezing the other half of the filling to use at a later date with biscuits good luck
5,this is the best like others i use my own pastry recipe i have made it like stated which is great but i like it the best made with left over gravy and to cup of cream and less salt my family love it i make two cook them both eat one freeze one or give it away to friends or family thxs karen johnson
5,jeanettenfrench i substitute beef and beef broth all the time i use broth instead of milk alsoi love this recipe have used it for a long time now
5,ive made this pie on a couple of times and every time it gets rave reviews even from the kids i also like that i can freeze one or give it away great recipe and delicious
5,this recipe is very easy and forgiving and lends itself well to substitutions i find the amount of filling is more than you need so i make little puff pastry pockets whith what is left over and it is a big hit i agree with other reviewers about the thyme and the butter i use about half as much of both with a good result i am no fan of store bought pastry so i used the betty crocker two crust pie recipe which is deliciously flaky if somewhat tricky to roll but if you put the dough between two pieces of parchment paper is comes out perfect
5,omg it was fabulous i used sweet potatoes insteadjust great
5,i am not normally a huge fan of chicken pot pie however i had lots of thanksgiving leftovers to use so i thought i would try one well boy and i glad i did i am now a believer this is the best chicken or turkey pot pie i have ever eaten even my husband raved i did leave out the corn and probably lowered the amount of thyme my shaker bottle wouldnt let me take the lid off so i just poured a couple of shakes worth in the sauce this recipe halves well as i wasnt about to make pot pies see first comment about not liking pot pie i will definitely make the full recipe next time and freeze one thanks for the amazing recipe
5,very yummy i halved and made one pie with home made crust and vegetarian chicken
5,this is a great recipe the first chicken pot pie that my family really likes and requests i have made it three times and it turns out perfect every time and warms up nicely the next day
5,delicious easy also freezes well
5,this is a very good chicken potpie but be aware that it makes alot i was unable to fit it into inch pie pans and used two larger deep dish rectangular dishes i really like the flavor of the filling and the fact that nothing canned was used all vegetables either fresh or frozen
5,cut the recipe in half as only two of us excellent as is i only added a bit of fresh ground nutmeg to the roux just because i always add nutmeg to a roux not sure with the thyme i really needed it in this one also needed bit more broth than stated or sauce gets to dry great dish update on the warm up with leftovers did get very dry if left overs next time will add a can of cream chicken soup or make more roux still delicious even dry
5,ive been making this chicken potpie for a few years now and cant believe ive never reviewed it i only make half because theres just the two of us but this is the only pot pie i ever make because its easy doesnt use canned soup and taste excellent if you dont have exactly whats in the recipe you can substitute anything your heart desires and its always good thanks karen johnson for making me look like a great cook
5,i always make these ahead and freeze them when im using up leftover chicken or turkeyi have one little trick i use i buy two premade pie crusts and only one package of therefrigerated rolled out pie crust i can freeze the pies readytobake without having to do so in my pie platesi fill the ready made crusts with the filling then brush the edges with egg wash top with pie crust sheets and press firmly with fork to adhere togetherthis makes the perfect no clean up dinner for busy days especially during the holidays
5,absolutely delicious and easy to make hearty meal that sticks to your ribs
5,this was wonderful i used fat free milk and fat free cheese for a healthy version and it was great the taste was great
5,there were no leftovers everyone had seconds and it was delicious
5,very good comfort food
5,this was delicious i made it just as the recipe said and i did put in a tiny amount of hot pepper sauce we loved it
5,this soup is a winner wonderful and filling soup on a cold day replaced the water with swansons chicken broth and used half n half really satisfyingthis is a quick and delicious soup
5,so goodmy family really enjoyed it served it with bread didnt change anything from the original recipe and omitted the hot sauce
5,this soup is so good its really quick and easy to makegreat for a busy mom i added closer to a cup and a half of cheese just to finish out the bag plus i love cheese and the flavor was really nice great soup to beat the winter blues
5,this was superb i did saute all the ingredients plus a clove of garlic first in a little olive oil before adding the brothwater made it even more flavorful
5,i live where you can buy cauliflower from the farmer huge head for enough for batch and a half so this is so inexpensive to make and so delicious i didnt have any celery so i chopped up a few cabbage leaves will definately make it again
5,i sauteed a little bit of onions in the butter and used light cheese and skim milk omitted the salt and thought it was still great
5,delicious quick and easy i would definitely make again
5,this soup is delicious i keep cracked black pepper on the table with this recipe
5,i had a head of cauliflower in my frig that i needed to use up so i decided to look online to see if i could find a good recipe so glad i did actually had all of the ingredients for this soup and it is delicious the only complaint i had was it could have been a little thicker but that can be easily solved loved the flavor so thats the most important thing
5,ive probably made this recipe a dozen times since i first found it it gets raves from everyone ive served it to and i find it velvety and absolutely wonderful thanks for posting debbie
5,i have been making the basic homemade bread and enjoying the loaves if i half the recipe to make one loaf do i half all ingredients even the yeast which means i only use teaspoon please advice thanks for all recipes
5,this is a great recipe i use high end garlic flavored evoo instead of canola oil to give it a garlic flavor and i use caputo italian chefs flour and the bread is super light and fluffy
5,is there anything better than homemade fresh warm bread smothered with butter definitely not this bread is so delicious and so easy sure to impress any guests and yourself
5,it came out much better than i thought it was a little to wet at first so i added more flour when kneading it was delicious i am no baker but this recipe gave me hope
5,despite my relative novice level this turned out good what made me select this recipe is the homemade bread tips that taste of home provided i enjoyed the simplicity which made the recipe more approachable my first attempt was a fail and was completely my fault because i didnt check the expiration date on my yeast which i knew after reading the tips the second attempt was so much better and gives me hope that i can get even better results i didnt have bread flour so i just used regular allpurpose flour my family enjoyed the bread as well
5,ive made bread before so nothing was new but it was fun to have hot bread as part of our meal the family loved it and it made me realize how really easy it is just think and plan ahead and you can give real treat to the ones you love
5,i usually use my bread maker but this recipe was easy and fun and the end results were fantastic i will make this again
5,perfect recipe for making newfoundland toutons
5,has anyone tried letting it finish the final rise overnight in the fridge before baking in the morning
5,this is a great recipe my boyfriend loves home made bread so i thought id try this one and it turned out great im very happy with the end results
5,i have made this a number of times and love it because i have only myself to feed i cook the vegetables as shown but put half of it in the freezer for another day i make half of the milk etc mixture each batch simple and satisfying
5,delish
5,this has become my absolute favorite soup
5,perfect i am not in any way a professional baker i am more of a newbie and this bread is so easy to make rather than kneading on a counter i just kept the dough in the standmixer and used the dough hook turns out great thank you so much for this recipe the family loves it
5,a nice easy recipe which i always double vegan too if you dont butter the hot crust when it comes out which i do our noble homestead goto recipe mmmm proudly served at the magic glamp with an olive oil substitution
5,i love to bake so ive tried many different basic bread recipes all of the ones ive made turn out too gooey on the inside not thoroughly cooked or too hard and crunchy additionally there are so many ingredients and it takes forever to make a loaf of bread this bread is the best bread ive ever had in my life it is such an easy recipe with only ingredients and it takes minutes to whip up aside from rising baking time the flavor is wonderful and the smell of baking bread fills the house for this recipe amazing
5,this was my very first attempt to make bread of any kind it was easy to do and came out perfect i actually made mine in the air fryer and cooked it at x minutes the texture was perfect and it wasnt too dense i followed the recipe exactly except for using the air fryer oven
5,this is the best bread ive ever made found this recipe about weeks ago and just made my th batch this morning hubby cant stop eating this
5,absolutely love this recipe thankyou so much this bread is exactly how i wanted my bread to be
5,i dont know where this recipe was last year i scoured the internet looking for a recipe with a x pan i used cups of white bread flour and added in enough whole wheat flour to make the dough and got two soft perfect loaves
5,a great recipe they came out beautifully will use recipe again
5,first bread i ever baked without a machine it came out great im glad i had years of the bread machine experience so that i knew what the consistency was supposed to be during the minute kneading
5,this came out fabulous love this recipe both loaves were fluffy and the crust was perfect thank you so much
5,i like this recipe because its easy to keep up with and isnt written in a convoluted story format and the website doesnt make you click next page and next page this website is less clickbait than the other top of google bread recipes the bread comes out good if you like a hard crust and soft spongy center my girlfriend says its too salty so im trying it with half the recipe recommended amount of salt i thought the salt was fine but i want her to eat the bread too so less salt and i tried it with honey instead of sugar but it didnt look like the yeast reacted to the honey the same way as sugar the yeast kind of climbed on to the honey but wasnt bubbling so i put sugar in there with the honey too i will probably try using more yeast and seeing if that makes the bread more fluffy too next time this recipe is a good baseline to go off of and youll probably want to make adjustments to your taste
5,perfect bread starter i do add ins black garlic onion flakes pepper powdered onion and garlic also used as base for raisin bread the options are endless
5,i use this recipe for my jalepeno cheese bread also i love this recipe
5,this bread is great i havent made anything yeasty in a very long time easy and tasty several reviews stated it was salty so i decreased the salt mistake use t as the recipe states and i used a lot less flour also i live in assisted living and the residents liked the bread slathered pieces in real butteryum make this bread
5,st time i tried it thank you perfect
5,i have baked homemade bread for many years this recipe yielded me the very best loaves of bread i have ever made the thing i done different this time was i used all bread flour historically i used all purpose flour while my bread always turned out well the crust was very hard and the bread was dense but i never had any leftovers this recipe and using bread flour my bread top was soft and my bread was light as it is from the grocery store i was amazed but i recommend trying this recipe and use bread flour only after it comes out of the oven brush the tops with melted butter i hope you enjoy making your bread and that it turns out perfectly as mine did thanks for providing home cooks with a great recipe
5,i started baking bread again last june this was the first recipe i used and it is the base for every bread ive made since it is so easy to add ingredients or swap one thing for another each time the bread has been a success ive made garlic kalamata olive bread chocolate granola bread and several other variations but at its heart its always this basic recipe thanks
5,easy recipe to follow i used bread flour and weighted my flour and used rapid yeast it raised beautifully both times i also used my proof feature of my oven this recipe is a keeper thank you

5,thank you for the recipe this was my first time baking bread and came out really good
5,i made bread for the first time using this recipe and it was amazing i used half the sugar but it still was great this recipe is a keeper
5,this recipe really surprised me it was so easy and the results are amazing far beyond my expectations it tasted like fresh delicious store bought soft warm italian breadthis is going to be a new favorite recipe of mine for sure my husband loved it incredibly delicious the proofing takes some time but all the steps were very easy to follow thank you so much i love it
5,i am by no means a baker last time i made bread was yrs ago i know this because my mom passed in this recipe is easy and tastes wonderful tip since yeast is the new toilet paper during this virus find a local bake shop and ask them is you can buy some yeast i found fresh and it had expired and worked beautifully just proof it like active dry yeast cheer and good luck
5,this was my first ever attempt at baking bread the recipe was easy to follow and i had fun baking great first time exoerience i mixed my flour with some wheat four and the bread came out perfectly
5,i made this yesterday and had some today for breakfast first time making bread and it was awesome my wife really enjoyed it too and said dont freeze the nd loaf because it wont last
5,i really enjoy this recipe its my goto my only question is regarding the nutritional content it says slice can you give the weight of one slice slice can vary in size thank you
5,it was my first time to bake bread the recipe was easy to follow had great results the bread was perfect my family loved it
5,im now rating this recipe but ive been using this one for the last months this recipe is amazing we tweaked by adding raw oats and crushed flaxseed to make it a little more healthy it came out really well this recipe for us yielded nice loaves and when we toasted the slices for breakfast the flavor of the oats and flaxseed made it even more delicious it feels like we had it in a café thank you for this we dont buy bread anymore
5,one of my first times making bread and this recipe yielded two fantastic loafs i was initially worried because the rise was quicker that the recipe said first one doubled in minutes and the second in and the bread was much bigger than anticipated but overall it tasted really good also the recipe doesnt estimate a cook time for me it was hour and minutes at c
5,it has become my go to recipe and have used this recipe several times love it thanks
5,i was looking for an easy foolproof bread recipe that did not require a bread machine this was perfect after making it according to the recipe the first time i got brave and added shredded coconut and some coconut extract to a batch worked great next i tried it chopped toasted almonds and almond extract super good will keep using this as my foundation as i try a few more variations
5,great recipe
5,great basic bread recipe easy even if you are so so at following directions i left to rise a bit too long but it still turned out like the photo not too many bubbles for me on the yeast either but again turned out like the photo i baked minutes the hollow sound didnt sound hollow to me it sounded dense to me but then again i dont know what to listen for as an amateur either way it turned out great despite some slight deviations on my part this really makes you think about wtf they are putting into store bought bread to make it that light texture talk about diluting the mixture with garbage the store bread you pay or more per loaf for and is marked up and low quality it is worth way less than that and i made this quality bread for about per batch cents per loaf at cents for yeast for lb bag flour divided at cups per pound using cups you could get even cheaper if you wanted to buy in bulk but that isnt necessary as you only save a few cents and then you have to make a lot of bread before the yeast expires id experiment by putting everything seasoning on the top of it caraway seeds pumpkin seeds sunflower seed pits the list goes on the bread is hearty for refined white bread flour and crusty not soft and easy to puncture than the store crap good luck youtube lcatrn
5,just a question do we have to preheat our convention oven for this if we have to how much and how long should we set it for
5,we love this basic bread it turned out perfectly and taste wonderful its a keeper
5,this recipe is great i have never made bread before aside from quick breads like banana and zucchini its was easy and tastes amazing suzanne i dont see any reason the old fashioned way wouldnt work it will just be a bit more effort on your part when it comes to the incorporating
5,first time making it and it turned out great my family loves it
5,this message is for suzanne ive made the bread with a standup mixer and by hand both times the bread turned out fine it was just a little easier with my kitchen aid
5,this is the only bread recipe that always works i followed the instructions exactly using bread flour combinations of white flour and whole wheat flour as well as millet or lentil flour along with white flour and it has always risen beautifully i have been baking bread every days and get perfect loaves every time thank you for this great recipe
5,i absolutely love this recipe i made this bread last night and family was shocked today because it was so good they never knew i could bake bread actually i never knew i could bake bread its awesome we are making more today so that both my daughters can learn how to do it
5,cant believe for a simple recipe how great this bread tastes i do use a mixer and dough hook and it turns out fine the only time i buy bread now is if im lazy and looking for a way out so far i havent boughten any one loaf i freeze for the following week so its only every two weeks i need to bake highly recommend this recipe both for the beginner and seasoned pro
5,fantastic recipe it was really easy i mixed by hand i substituted in about cup of semolina flour since i am running low on strong flour due to the flour shortage it was fine texture and flavour were excellentl my kids loved it and one loaf was gone within minutes
5,what started as a joke between my mom and my cousins turned into an amazing joke i made the bread today and it was delicious easy to follow and amazing taste definitely a keeper
5,just made this and it turned out great considering i didnt have all the correct ingredients i halved the quantities as i only wanted one loaf and used half self raising flour and half pasta flour as that was all i had and im pretty sure my yeast was dead as it was out of date and didnt bubble but it worked only ever made soda bread before so this was a great result for me as a first time bread baker
5,yeast seems to be in short supply right now so i found this recipe while searching for a recipe that used only one packet of yeast i made no changes to the recipe and ended up with two beautiful and tasty loaves of bread i found the video to be very helpful also my usual recipe calls for two packets of yeast this bread takes longer to make but is just as good i let it rise in the bowl for raw full two hours and for hrs in the pans
5,this recipe is absolutely amazing the bread comes out super brown and my house literally smells like a bakery im so glad i discovered this recipe before quarantine to those that are struggling try again and in my opinion do everything in one bowl
5,just finished baking this bread easy recipe and great results have baked other bread and much more difficult recipes in the past and havent had as much success as with this one
5,just came out of the oven and we have eaten half of the first loaf its delicious
5,this recipe guideline was easy to use with amazing results the bread is delicious and going on day still fresh and moist it was my first try ive never baked bread before and i was thrilled with the results try out this recipe it is good
5,first time attempting bread this recipe worked great even with whole wheat flower turned out awesome
5,easy recipe to follow nice textured bread
5,i was super excited to try and make this bread recipe because it was my first time the process was a bit frustrating but the end result was perfect really liked and so did my friends
5,i made this recipe as directed turned out almost perfect i love it the next time i mad it i did not have the active dry yeast i substituted rapid yeast aka instant yeas and the bread turned out even better i did not change anything except of activating the yeast really fluffy and still full bodied there is a slight change in flavor it is has a little less yeast smell but not anything to change my mind i highly recommend this recipe especially for the first time baker this is almost fool proof
5,this recipe is easy and l nailed it the first time will never buy bread again
5,i never succeeded at making bread until i used this recipe i highly suggest you follow the link on how to proof your bread what a difference it made i never watched the video i simply followed the written directions
5,this recipe is amazing i am a complete newbie when it comes to bread i can make pizza dough like a pro but bread has always intimidated me using bread flour in my recipe was my first priority second was no milk or egg this recipe was easy to follow and ended up with a bread better than the bakery my picky eaters words i used a dough hook on my mixer and after was pulled together i hand kneaded it for about minutes longer the most perfect bread ever dont be intimidated just follow written directions fully only thing i would add is to put the rack toward the bottom so the poof of the bread is in the middle of the oven when its risen and browning thank you again
5,loved it and it was easy
5,this was my st time making homemade bread complete success it came out perfect
5,hi i love making bread i used to make it the standard way i found an old fleishman booklet that had two ways to make it i like the sponge method but still my bread nd day is crumbly and heavy any suggestions
5,fantastic bread recipe it takes our family about three days to go through a loaf of bread so i refrigerated half the dough after kneading it the first time it continues to rise in the fridge so make sure you put it in a container with room for it to double and a tight fitting lid took it out today punched it down shaped for the second loaf and continued the recipe from there it turned out perfectly
5,i have made this bread a couple times and love it i only had rapid rise yeast so i only had to let it rise once i just put all the ingredients in a stand up mixer bowl together and mix and then add my bread attachment and finish adding the flower after you mix it and if you use rapid yeast let it rest for minutes then cut in half put in the pan and let rise and turn the oven on and bake them best bread recipe ever
5,this recipe is great i made one pie then froze the rest to use in a new pie crust later
5,ive made this recipe numerous times and it always comes out great i cut the recipe in half and use half of the required flour amount because we like our gravy thinner i add two tablespoons of white wine to the brothmilk mixture i also only use one crust on top no crust on the bottom this recipe is a keeper
5,absolutely fantastic this is the best recipe for chicken potpie and much rather use the amount of butter in this recipe than canned cream soups which most potpie recipes use i halved the recipe amp followed the recipe exactly however right before putting it in the oven i brushed the top crust with egg wash karen thank you so much for sharing your recipe with us all
5,love the previous reviewers idea of using the frozen pie crusts on the bottom and one package of the refrigerated crusts for the top you are freeing up your pie plates from being in the freezer and if you take one to someone else they dont have to return the plate so good
5,absolutely love this
5,this was awesome and to have one for the freezer too is such a bonus the thyme is the key ingredient that makes it unique amp yummy
5,very good pie plus it makes two of them
5,hands down the best chicken pot pie recipe out there
5,love this recipe i have made it three times and my family have commented how good it tastes it is nice to use whatever you have on hand one family member cant have corn so i just added mushrooms and celery love you can freeze one for later it is in my recipe box as a keeper
5,this recipe is fantastic and simple i cut it in half and only added some extra seasonings to the original recipe it turned out wonderful my husband had his plate clean before i was halfway through its a keeper
5,awesome
5,this one is a keeper ive tried a lot of different recipes almost each time i try a new one i think this one is the best yet i followed what others have said and added less saltpepperthyme but love the thyme in it i doubled this recipe i had just pulled apart rotisserie chickens and had a lot of meat and i could have made decent size deep dish pot pies from that amount had i enough pie crust as it was i ended up with deep dish probably over filled pies with one going to the freezer and i still some filling left over that i can make probably mini pies from once i make more pie crust
5,used olive oil instead
5,this is the first bread recipe i have made that did not come out rubbery or extremely dense i was impressed after watching the video i realized my dough was not the proper consistency according to the flour and liquid ratio in the recipe i only used cups of flour as was far too much and did not mix well i will make this again as it was delicious i feel like an instant bread expert thank you
5,love this bread my wife and family also love this delicious sandwich bread definitely doesnt require all of the flour i used around cups everything else is spot on though to quote holly i felt like an instant bread expert i have already made this recipe xs the first time with all purpose flour came out dry and spongy the second time i used baking flour and the bread was perfect crisp yet chewy thank you
5,absolutely one of the best lightest tastiest white breads i have ever made and theres been a few thank you to steve for the suggestion regarding flour started out with cups and added as neededkneaded ended up with the whole cups the only thing i did different was i used a couple of tips i had from various cinnamon roll recipes that work the first one being heat liquid for yeast in the microwave starting with minute then add to more seconds until you reach deg f then add yeast and tsp sugar while mixing ingredients for dough heat oven to deg f then turn off and allow to cool slightly then put the dough in there to raise door closed i use a metal bowl and cover with a damp towel left in there for full hrs and when it came time to put into pans i covered them and put back in the oven until it was time to preheat for baking i havent had an issue with dough rising since i started using this method as long as yeast is before best by date
5,the amount of flour is a suggestion i used to make bread every friday and just getting back to it so i knew that depending upon the humidity sometimes i use c or c or c finish adding the flour during the hand kneading process and youll never go wrong
5,a very good recipe for nice sandwich bread obviously the amount of flour and water depends very much on the temperature humidity and elevation so it would have been helpful to be very specific about what the dough should look and feel like at each stage since this is a beginners recipe but it makes great bread if you want rustic bread i swear by the recipe on the king arthur flour website its absolutely foolproof im a mediocre baker but ive never messed up that recipe ever
5,fantastic recipe i followed the recipe and it turned out prefect my first time making bread i did youtube on activating yeast and how to tell when you have knead enough very good flavor and great for beginners
5,tasty easy to follow recipe my family definitely approved yum delicious
5,super easy tastes great
5,paige whole wheat flour absorbs more water than white white flour so either you need to increase the amount of water or decrease the amount of flour id you want to keep a similar texture you can try substituting of the white flour for whole wheat flour
5,amazingly good
5,bread tastes amazing however time is misleading on the recipe since it needs a few hours to rise any other time i read recipes completely before making them but i was in a rush and didnt until half way thru i only jad about an hour to let it rise and then put in oven still turned out great and everyone loved it i did add just about c of whole wheat flour
5,the house smelled amazing while this was baking absolutely thought i had died and gone to heaven with my first slice it also makes very good toast you will never need another white bread recipe
5,i had seen this recipe and then lost it so was going from memort i used pks of yeast instead of it was fantastic chewy soft and that yeadty flavor i love this makes a wonderful base for cinnamon rolls hint hint
5,outstanding and simple bread the taste is terrific i have one package of yeast left during the pandemic so we are eating the bread sparingly nobody has any yeast great bread
5,i followed exactly what the recipe says and this bread turns out perfect every single time i had never made any kind of homemade bread before and this was so easy it does take some time simply because how long it takes the dough to rise but the amount of time actually making and working with the dough is not long at all my family loves this bread and i have actually had some people purchase loaves off of me as well i was even told that it is better than bread from amish country thanks so much for this recipe i will definitely recommend it to anyone that wants to make their own bread
5,i dont buy bread at the store all the crap you buy there and most of the flour mixes have bromate so i finally decided to buy bromate free flour and try to cook wait is it took or make or make make bread it was easier than i thought it would be to make its rising right now kinda huge i realized though that i dont have any bread pans so this is going to be an interesting experiment going to toss it on a cookie sheet and eat what happens i like that the recipe was so easy i dont like the ads i have to scroll through in the middle of the page ill try this again next week i think
5,this was such an easy recipe and the result was awesome im super impressed ive tried a bunch of recipes and this is a winner
5,i made your recipe and it is the best i love it made some this morning and we ate awesome sandwiches for lunch yes thank you and bless you
5,best recipe i have tried and i have been trying to find a really good bread recipe for a long time the bread is light and fluffy thank you my search is st an end
5,my wife and i made this bread tonightamazing unbelievably awesome first time making it is and our three kids are hooked thank you
5,have been using this recipe for years and i love it always consistently good bread
5,this is a wonderful recipe to make its easy
5,this is a five star recipe all the way its a perfect recipe every time and everyone loves it including me
5,i use this recipe as a template as an experienced baker i can make numerous modifications with a recipe this basic to answer some other concerns it is helpful to start with the yeast and two cups of flour and add the liquid ingredients before you add salt and let sit about ten minutes this fully activated the yeast and can improve results to the person whose bread came out doughy have you confirmed your oven temperature is accurate often home ranges can vary in actual temperature
5,my bread used to always come out either really dry or way too dense and chewy this is the first recipe that gives me consistently good results now i use it as a base and make little alterations to experiment in the kitchen ive got a lemon pepper garlic bread rising now
5,can you make this with out a mixer and have it still come out fine
5,this is a great fast bread recipe and to answer one of the questions below yes you can use a stand mixer i used the whisk for the initial mixing and then switched to the kneading hook for the minutes suggested in the recipe turned out fantastic
5,just came out very nicemy everyday breakfast is now changed to breadthank you very very very very very muchwish you the best
5,oh my god this nonbaker made this bread today and it is fantastic i used a little less than cups of flour followed the directions to the t and shaped them into round loaves because why would i have loaf pans i greased x cake pans with bacon fat shortning and smeared them with a little of it before i popped them on the oven thirty minutes later with a ten minute cool down and boy is this bread yummy super delicious and not real heavy great recipe thank you toh
5,my very first time making bread and it came out great i honestly dont think im ever gonna buy store bought white bread again its super easy and cheap to make mine was a little on the dense and salty side so maybe ill use a tad bit less salt but its still sooo good
5,literally the only thing ive baked looked kinda weird and i forgot the canola oil but it was still yummy good recipe for a valiant first attempt hopefully ill remember the oil next time
5,delicious i am extremely impressed it turned out great and it was my first time ever baking experiment has anyone tried putting seeds in it just wondering if that would work on another note i suggest using olive oil instead of canola it gives the perfect kick
5,thanks for this looks so easy and delicious i will try to do this one
5,stupid easy to make i forgot to grease the top of the bread but that didnt seem to affect it much also for those curious you can definitely replace canola oil with olive oil and regular sugar with brown sugar or truvia brown sugar blend if thats all you have if using truvia blend make sure to follow the sugar to truvia conversion in the back of the bag thanks so much for this awesome recipe will try making these on a weekly basis and see if i can save money on store bought bread
5,ive made this several times i added sausage cheeses garlic onion and herbs and it is absolutly amazing try it you will love it thanks for the recipe
5,my favorite home made bread ever easy to make and lovely warm with butter i use the tbsp sugar as stated in the ingredients list and not the cup it says in the directions though that bit was confusing at first lol i just follow the ingredients list and proofed the yeast then added the other ingredients to that in my stand mixer adding the flour a half cup at a time till the last half cup then i just kind of throw pinches at it till it looks right haha beautiful bread thank you
5,another amazing bread recipe they came out perfect
5,love this bread im making it for a second time due to the fact my family cant get enough i dont mind because its super simple to make and comes out perfect every time
5,i have made it several times now its perfect thank you
5,i have been making this bread every sunday for about a year now its a fantastic sandwich bread i make loaves every sunday for sandwiches for the week i brush some butter on the tops of them as soon as theyre out let them cool for a couple hours then slice them and stick them in the freezer ready for sandwiches
5,yummy
5,first time making bread was a week or so ago i decided the best thing to do was keep it simple and this bread turned out amazing my gf was pretty impressed to see that i had made bread too here i am again a week later making it again lt
5,omg the best i used this recipe for the first time last night the bread came out perfect so moist and delicious my daughter couldnt get enough i used a glass loaf dish and followed the directions step by step will definitely use this recipe again
5,this recipe is the best i dont bake ever and i consider myself a complete novice in the kitchen and i just made this for the first time and i had to eat half a loaf it was so good i threw in a couple handfuls of dried cranberries omg make this if you want to impress people too bad i only have my dog to impress lol she had a slice
5,have been baking bread for over years this recipe by far has the best taste texture and easiest recipe i have tried thank you for sharing sandra today was my second time using this recipe i know i will be using it very often
5,great recipe best bread ive made so far turned out exactly as youd hope and has risen perfectly topped mine with shallots and grated cheese before baking for a bit of added flavour definitely recommend you try this one
5,ive gone through many recipes trying to find one that was simple good texture and taste great my search is over this is the one ive been looking for
5,omg ive always sucked at bread until this recipe awesome it came out great my daughter kept asking for more
5,made this bread for the first time for easter nice workout kneading the bread for sure i did use a little over two tablespoons of sugar and two teaspoons of salt based on other reviews and used an egg wash we had a couple of slices with bolognese for dinner and even the end slice was tasty this is a great recipe that i will make again need to just have the time to let it rise
5,question could i substitute self rising flour for the ap thanks
5,this was my very first time making bread and it turned out perfect i really love the ease of this recipe i highly recommend it to anyone who wants to make bread
5,this is a delicious bread recipe if you own a kitchenaid stand mixer use the dough kneading attachment and set the timer for minutes instead of doing it by hand unless you want a workout
5,if you are looking for bread your grandma made you fond it i believe make great rolls cinnamon rolls i used my stand mixer to make the dough i have been making bread for some time this is the best i have found be sure to let your bread cool down you my not be able to cut it until next day i dont how old my yeast is it came from a food bank in a bag we put in a pizza jar and keep it in the relegate
5,thank you thank youmy bread came out great i even had extra dough to make cinnamon bread this is my go to bread no more store brought bread
5,simple and absolutely amazing i have baked bread homemade and from scratch all my life as i am a jewish woman this recipe is easy and simple but gives you the finest of bakeries taste bakeries that id rate outstanding at stars incredible and an absolute must try
5,real good but i couldnt get it to fit to well in my microwave but once i put it in a bowl it fit just fine it tasted even better with cinnamon on it trust me
5,my husband and i love this bread it doesnt take me all day to make which is a big plus and it tastes great i have it for breakfast make my husbands lunch with it and serve it at dinner when we want bread i dont use quite so much sugar or salt and the results are still great
5,this is any easy bread recipe to make i cut my the next day and it sliced pretty easily not breaking all apart
5,this is the best and easiest bread recipe i made a few adjustments but the foundation recipe for ingredients measures and prepcooking were straight from this recipe i used bread flour instead of ap flour olive oil on place of the canola thats what i had on hand and threw in some savory spices to give it a kick and it rose up better than any recipe id ever used plus i put a dash of olive oil in the dough because i read that bread flour dough can be dry
5,love this bread i make it at lease twice a month comes out perfect every time
5,this is an excellent recipeits so easy and so good i halved both loaves after the first halves to make twists then egg washed and sesame seeds beautiful loaves
5,full disclosure not the best bread recipie ive came across in some years of baking bread by hand but it does get stars because its so easy and reliablei use bulk flour sugar and even yeast no need tp buy premium ingredients heretips proof the yeast water and sugar for at least minutesmake sure the water isnt over degreesdo not over rise or over bakeit works fone for me
5,easy to follow turned out really good my family loved it i did bake both loafs together and baked it for minutes instead of i have convection oven otherwise perfect
5,i baked this bread earlier today and it was so easy it turned out great and is very delicious my year old loved it
5,i always use my own pastry but the filling was spot on this was a typical roux so am uncertain why many thought it was too much flour as with any roux you must cook long enough with liquid to make it a somewhat thick but creamy white sauce before adding the other ingredients so maybe that is the case will definitely keep this in the wheelhouse of recipes
5,i made this recipe for the first time its by far the best pot pie recipe ive ever hadmade i ended up with enough filling for pies based on the recipe but im not complaining it turned out perfect by following the recipe not sure why other reviews indicate needing to use less flour or seasonings
5,it was absolutely delicious my family of devoured this i did make my own crust my husband and son said if i was to change anything the only thing they would want was more chicken i followed the recipe perfectly and i thought the seasonings were perfect as well as the amount of flour and i am not a meat fan so i thought the amount of chicken was perfect
5,made this the first time as written i felt it was too salty and the thyme flavor was overwhelming the second time i used sodium reduced broth eliminated the salt and cut the pepper and thyme to a tsp it came out perfect it is definitely a keeper
5,this is an excellent recipe i did add three hard boiled eggs i reduced the tymeand salt as suggested and it was fabulous i do recommend doubling the sauce through it was too dry
5,in a wordfabulous followed the recipe as is except halved for the two of us and due to personal preference left out the corn but put in extra carrots and potatoes
5,this is the best chicken pot pie recipe i have ever made it is delicious and freezes well
5,ive been making this recipe for the past year its absolutely delicious i usually freeze one of the two which i love its great knowing you have a meal ready in the freezer if needed this meal is perfect for the colder seasons i also appreciate that its a recipe that you can throw in whatever veggies you have on hand i love celery so ill saute celery with the onions and if i have green beans or anything else i can make additions or adjustments with the veggie amounts
5,i have made this often and it is a great dish my fatherinlaw loves it and is always asking when i will be making again because he would love another one soon
5,chill the filling completely to keep the crust from being doughy
5,made this today half recipe and loved it i used a cup of the frozen hash browns instead of fresh potatoes and that worked fine this is a keeper
5,very very good i have never really liked other chicken pot pies that i have had in the past but my husband and daughter love them and theyve been asking me to make it forever when i saw the video for this recipe it looked easy enough and i had all the ingredients already i didnt realize this was a double recipe though since it made enough for two pot pies i gave one away and they really enjoyed it to the only thing i will change next time is so skip the corn and add two cups of green peas just because i think it looks prettier with more green in it
5,excellent so often we all make a small tweak in the recipe but i made this just as the directions stated ok i made one tiny change and used closer to cups of potatoes rather than cups but those cubed potatoes were just sitting there on my cutting boardvery very good even my food particular mother loved it and was willing to take home leftovers
5,scrumptious i have been searching for a chicken pot pie recipe and this one is a keeper i didnt have any thyme so i substituted with poultry seasoning using only half the amount required perfect
5,i have tried many pot pie recipes and this is hands down the best i clicked on some of the other reviews that were stars because i couldnt imagine why no one would like this my best guess if you think it is too floury or too much thyme then maybe try again because honestly i make these for anyone who is sick birthdays neighborsand they rave constantly maybe a misstep in the recipe was done the directions are correct and i like that they have the frozen bake time it is listed separate for easy understanding i love being able to have a frozen option such as this instead of soupchili all the time
5,didnt think i would get it right but somehow i did then i started doing twice the recipe and ended up with substituting some flour with wheat bran and try different shapes i ended up with baguettes subs bread and buns all in one cooking session even tried some maple amp cinnamon bread which ended up great
5,my family loves this recipe i use it to make rolls perfect crusty but soft bread love it
5,this is my go to recipe i am a novice bread baker and was a bit nervous if this recipe would work out i am glad i did its a hit every time the only thing i would like to share is the first time the bread lost moisture and so was a bit hard but then a friend told me to put a tray with water on the bottom rack to create a steam oven i am glad i got this tip the bread comes out moist on the inside and crusty on the outside
5,i have never baked anything before the homemade bread recipe was excellent and easy thank you
5,i am not experienced with yeast breads at all this is the second one ive made i followed the recipe exactly and was rewarded with two beautiful and delicious loaves of bread the crust came out just right crispness and the texture on the inside is delightful soft delicious i am so proud of how they turned out easy to follow directions will definitely use this recipe againedit my family tried it later in the day and all of them lost their mind over the deliciousness and i received specific compliments on crust and texture this bread is really a hit
5,first time i made bread was very easy and came out perfectly thank you
5,this recipe is awesome i made it just like the recipe stated it was perfect i will be making more today my whole family loved it for people who cant get the bread to rise try putting it in front of a small heater it helped mine rise a lot
5,i used this recipe when i decided to start making bread again perfect i preheat the oven to degrees then shut it off as im kneading and the dough rises perfectly my husband is always happy when im making this and prefers it to store bought bread
5,i made this bread tonightit turned out great i did take advice of a previous review and raised my dough in an oven preheated to you turn the oven off before putting your dough in i love this simple yummy bread recipe
5,was super easy to make and turned out well the directions were simple and easy to follow
5,love this simple recipe this is my st time baking white bread at home i have baked spelt flour recipes a couple of times and came out good love the taste instead of adding only all purpose flour i added cups all purpose and the rest spelt flour also added a tblspoon of flax seed powder i have never loved white bread like this before next time i will definitely use all all purpose flour i am a beginner in bread baking this recipe really made me confident abt my bread baking skills thank you
5,worked out great
5,i have made this twice and after the first rise dont knead the dough it makes it very dense on my second bake it was half as dense but it was still dense if you dont knead it enough before the first rise the glutton wont build enough to become light and fluffy
5,awesome awesome awesome bread so good as a sandwich killer as mop up bread with gravy even better with garlic seasoning and butter lightly toasted i have made this bread six times now and everyone loves it thanks so much
5,i just made this bread and it turned out marvelous however i feel like it has some important steps left out that you need to know if youre not an experienced bread baker first of all to activate your yeast you need to put the warm water and yeast and sugar alone in your bowl stir it well cover it and set it aside when its frothy looking those foamy looking bubbles mean the yeast is ready to go then add all the other ingredients otherwise its a great basic recipe make sure to work the dough long enough i do half with a dough hook and my kitchenaid and half by hand on a flour dusted counter it needs to feel really smooth and stretchy good luck it tastes delicious and a perfect texture
5,turned out great
5,first time baking bread and this recipe was so easy to follow and bread came out delicious crust was just right perfect height and density i used cups of king arthurs unbleached bread flour and added a touch of honey i will be making my own bread and rolls from now on using this basic recipe
5,i tried this recipe once and it was terrible the second time i used cup water and tablespoon sugar dissolved the sugar and then added the yeast cover the yeast and let it set for minutes until frothy after that i added the rest of the ingredients and kneeded the living carp out of it everything turned out perfect this time light fluffy and yeasty it was delicious just active the yeast in this way and it will turn out fine
5,i created an account just to rate this excellent recipe which i followed exactly as written i know some people have commented that its important to activate the yeast but i didnt do that i just did what the recipe said and it worked out fine i also used regular old allpurpose flour some have said its important to use some kind of special bread flour and it was perfect light fluffy with a crust that wasnt too hardexactly what i wanted im not sure what happened with the folks who called this recipe terrible and said they ended up with bread that was inedible all i can say is their experience is nothing like minehighly recommended
5,making this recipe for the second time this week its easy and delicious i mix the yeast water and sugar in the bowl first wait ten minutes and then add in the salt flour and oil i use a blend of bread flour whole wheat and ground flax seed it makes loaves that are light and not too crusty
5,the best bread recipe that i have ever used beautiful and very delish my now go to bread recipe
5,great easy recipe and a first time bread maker like me can make great tasting bread and so easy to make
5,ive been making this bread for the last years and my family loves it this bread is easy to make and tastes wonderful too this bread is a staple in our home
5,omg first time i ever baked bread this recipe is the best first time and easy to follow instructions will make it more of it and tasty nice and fluffy
5,my family and i love this recipe for bread st try and success for starters start here i watched a youtube before attempting to get the process down
5,absolutely perfect i have been searching for an easy picture perfect yeast bread recipe for years the first recipe i tried i threw away the loaf this is fool proof and yes i did modify used only cups flour then extra for dusting only used tsp of salt if i could add a picture i would i drove in a thunderstorm to take slices to neighbor because i needed a witness as how wonderful it was a man would marry you in a heartbeat if you served thislol
5,i accidentally doubled the amount of sugar salt and oil i tried to cut the recipe in half mistakes were made but the bread still came out looking and tasting amazing i imagine my accidental adjustments just made for a more flavorful loaf which is nothing im complaining about i would definitely make this again
5,it was delicious and easy to make i would recommend putting an egg wash or butter over the loaf before cooking to make it look better though
5,simply delicious my husband loved it too
5,i have never been able to bake bread it was always a waste i am loving this recipe i could tell by the dough that it would be good but it wa really great after the cups of flour i did what the recipe advised and added the extra flour cup at a time and cups did the trick plus extra for kneading i made a nice round loaf a regular sized loaf and cinnamon rolls that i made by adding a mixture of sugar brown sugar cinnamon butter and a bit of flour and vanilla and heaping it on top of the rolls before baking everything tasted delicious im hooked will be baking this bread alot thank you
5,i had no idea what i was doing making bread on my own for the first time this recipe is so easy for the beginner and the only problem i had with the bread was how quickly my family scarfed it down thank you so much
5,this was perfectly simple and delicious i made it just as written i started with cups of flour but easily made it to cups while kneading the dough i only have one bread pan so i put half of the dough in a loaf pan and made the rest as a round loaf in a casserole dish both turned out great im sure we will be making this again soon
5,guys this recipe worked my family loved it so from now on we prefer making our own bread at home save money and way delicious yes guys thanks to the owner god bless
5,my family and i are absolutely in love with this recipe i only halved the recipe and came out best its the bomb this is my go to bread recipe from now on
5,could this recipe be doubled
5,awesome easy bread recipe loaf just came fresh out of the oven yum perfect ingredient portions even works with himalayan pink salt for regular salt amp pure cane sugar instead of regular when i divided the dough in half made that one loaf and divided the other half in two put them in refrigerator for future use thanks for sharing
5,simply outstanding ive made this recipe more than once several times at high elevation in denver another time atnear sea level in houston i never leave reviews for recipes but felt the need to pay it forward on this one pro tip based on experience and experimentation use unbleached bread flour if you want a softer crust ive used standard allpurpose bleached flour but the crust ends up too hard its almost too difficult to cut through it in the end i much prefer the softer crust as for the rest of the recipe follow it its perfect i mix it all by hand using a mixing bowl and literally a regular fork yes my arm begins to ache by the time ive added the th cup of flour also if you are a breadbaking newbie like i was i used advice found online to determine if my bread had risen enough on both the st and nd rise
5,i actually signed up on here to leave a review i never leave reviews for recipes ive tried but i made this bread and this was the first time i got bread right the dough was stiff yet workable it raised well and i actually got loaves instead of just the it tasted delicious and this is the recipe id pass down to my generation of family its that amazing
5,ive made this bread several times already the first time was good and has only gotten better each time i concur with ryan below about using bread flour i used king arthur but i use my wifes beloved kitchenaid stand mixer which more than meets and exceeds the challenge of kneading i also divide the dough into thirds and can even go for four small loaves and it does keep for a few days if it lasts that long d the final bread product when made with bread flour is a good crumb nice chew and wonderfully crispy yet soft crusta wonderful beginners recipe ill experiment with adding herbs and other flavors to this dough
5,this is by far the most simplistic bread recipe ive ever come across ive tried so many bread recipes but i could never memorize them because of so many steps involved and the bread never came out exactly as the recipes image or as it should this recipe came out perfect my kids and husband loved it and i was able to memorize the steps so i can put my spin on it today i made it for the second time with cups white flour and cups wheat peerfect its a keeper
5,oh my jesus such a simple and perfect recipe the bread is awesome soft on the inside a bit of crunch on the outside mmmh mmmh mmmh i made mine with a little less flour too about cups and added raisins thank you so much for posting this
5,i have tried my entire life to make bread like this and i felt like queen for a day when i actually succeeded your recipe made learning it fun thanks for making a recipe that finally made me a success
5,great recipe i like it better with tsp of salt i also added some chopped jalapeno and cheddar cheese to one loaf it was great
5,absolutely love this recipe i have made it several times now my husband and i have stopped buying bread and only eat what i make linda that posted nov the olive oil will make it salty and taste a little weird i would recommend using either canola or vegetable oil corn oil may also work but havent tried it as long as you use the right type of oil one tablespoon of salt is perfect i also like to grease the bowl and pans with un salted butter it adds a nice slight butter taste
5,this is exactly the same as the recipe i use in my bread machine just use half the ingredients and add an egg heaven one trick i do that really makes a huge difference is to spray surface with pam instead of dusting with four also spray your hands butter would work just as well
5,love this recipe the bread was delicious we doubled the recipe and used extra virgin olive oil instead of canola oil it came out perfect i just decreased the salt as olive oil has a stronger taste as canola
5,perfective tried other easy recipes over the last days and both went in the trash i finally found this recipe and while reluctant because of the last failures i decided to give this one a try i am sooooo glad i did not only are the ingredients simple but so is putting it together and making iti did make a few minor modifications based on some of the reviews i used cups of flour instead of the to cups it calls for i found that the recommended amount of flour was just entirely too much i also used vegetable oil instead of canola because thats all i hadthis bread is wonderful my husband son and mother ate a whole loaf in two hours the other loaf is almost gone todayit is so moist and soft i cant believe it turned out this good i made everyone french toast this morning and grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch we will no longer spend for a loaf of store bought bread ive finally found my tried and trusted recipe right heregood luck everyone enjoy this awesome recipe your family will thank you for it ps this site should allow us to post pictures to prove how our recipes turned out
5,i love this recipe and so does everyone whose tasted it i had to start dividing the dough into three portions and put the loaves into smaller pans since my family nearly inhales it every time i make it i dont even need to adjust the baking time they turn out beautifully every time as for the amount of flour i think the recipe is only showing you what you will need before you start like say you only need cups of flour for the bread what happens if you only have that much flour you cant knead the bread so well cuz you ran out i tested how much i end up using after my dough is ready to be kneaded and i use almost another whole cup of flour
5,i just made this amazing bread and it tastes great i only needed cups of flour and it still came out quite dense i baked in the oven one level up from the bottom with a cookie sheet on the bottom level this keeps the bottom from getting too burntit came out looking exactly like the picture my kids love it too this is great cause i hate breadmakers since the belt eventually slips on them and they make more noise now i can make bread with no preservatives
5,i had never made bread before trying this recipe it is so good im now making loaves for my neighbors for christmas i also added cheese and jarred jalapeos and was worried that it would mess up with not changing any of the other measurements turned out delicious turned out delicious thank you for this recipe
5,i used this recipe to make my first bread in the oven ive used a bread machine before easy to make and tastes great i used cups of flour
5,this is essentially the betty crocker white bread recipe from the cookbook which i no longer have so i was happy to find a similar recipe the only difference i can see is the betty crocker recipe called for shortening or lard rather than canola oil i compromised and used butter lol also if im not mistaken the betty crocker recipe says to bake at not im going to give this a go this time and stick to the recipe as written other than the butter that isbecause it looks like its a winner as writteni just want to say im a touch annoyed by reviewers who leave one star then go on to explain how they changed this and that and had bad results and wont make the recipe again how about actually following the recipe and if you dont its a little unfair to onestar the posted recipe when its your changes that probably really failed just a thought and yes one tablespoon of salt is the correct amount
5,first time bread maker from scratch omg this is as good as chocolate a must repeat recipe simply outstanding
5,great recipe i used half whole wheat and half white flour i also used olive oil instead of the canola oil called for this recipe calls for one tablespoon of salt i thought that was too much so i used less i should have added the full tablespoon the recipe called for the bread was still very good but when i make this again and i will add one tablespoon of salt thanks for the great bread recipe
5,followed the recipe as it is works fine tnx
5,great bread easy recipe and it rose really well with a crusty outside and fluffy inside i made a loaf and some buns for burgers with the dough and they were perfect i read a couple reviews about the flour total being wrong the recipe does ask for cups in total and i added that much and it was fine it asks for three cups first and then additional flour after as much as needed followed the recipe as is and it turned out as i would have hoped i will make this again and pass it on
5,currently enjoying this toasted with jam and a nice cup of coffee great recipe i found the sugar unnecessary so eliminated that and it tastes just as good also decided to just wing it on the flour add it until the dough was ready no more no less and that worked better than the first batchive never baked bread before and this was the perfect beginners recipe so excited to try new twists on it as well
5,easy amp simple recipe to follow delicious every time
5,i double this recipe and bake loaves at a time because my family amp i love this bread so much it is a delicious recipe garlic cheese toast open pb amp j sandwiches and good ole buttered toast are just a few of our favorite ways to eat it my daughter just eats it plain and untoasted she likes it so much
5,thanks a lot for the easy to follow recipe and videos im a beginner bread maker and your videos really help me thanks again from nz

5,this recipe was so easy and my family loved it i have a question about making mini loaves what would be the cook time
5,tried this recipe today super easy and my loaves came out really welllovely super soft texturethanks a bunch for the recipe
5,i made this bread today and followed the recipe pretty close including the rising times except for a couple ingredients i changed out cups of the flour for whole wheat flour and used instant dry yeast tsp pkg yeast plus i added a little more yeast about tsp because of the whole wheat flour i also sifted all the flour after measuring it raised beautifully and turned out very good its going to be my go to recipe for bread enjoying every slice
5,loved it ive never made bread before and this was so much easier than i thought it would be great by itself or for sandwiches
5,this bread is the most consistently fantastic bread i have ever madeand i make a lot of bread i love the attention i get for this wonderful bread i dont deserve the fuss really because it is dead easy to make ha ha
5,this recipe is awesome i have never made bread before and was so worried that id be terrible at it because my mom never got the hang of it the only thing i did differently is i used instant yeast instead of the active dry because when i bought yeast before finding this recipe i didnt know which to buy other than that i followed the recipe to a t the bread came out perfect i cant believe i made perfect bread on my first try and its really yummy ill be using this recipe from now on and ill be making a lot more bread from here on out
5,works great though i only need cups of flour or it becomes too dense
5,i have made this bread twice with bleached flour and whole wheat flour both turned out perfect and taste great easy recipe for a beginner bread maker thanx for the recipe
5,really simple quick and tasty bread i used cups of ultragrain white flour and found it to be the perfect texture with great rise as long as my kitchen was decently warm i let the loaves rise beside my crock pot while it was cooking some soup on low and that seemed to do the trick the taste was really lovely just a hint of sweet and not too yeasty with a nice crumb and golden crispy crust will be making this bread often
5,great basic bread and just what i was looking for i substituted olive oil for canola oil and didnt notice a difference i also turned one loaf into focaccia bread i put half the dough in an oiled x lasagna pan and sprinkled the top with minced fresh garlic and sliced olives i let it rise the second time and baked it alongside the regular loaf minutes before it was done i sprinkled shredded cheese over the top very tastyalso used two tbsp sugar instead of three with no problem
5,i would like to make this bread but with less sugar would that be possible
5,i made this recipe today and used all purpose flour and whole wheat the loaves turned out golden brown on the outside and a lovely light brown on the inside the bread was delicious the recipe was easy to follow and i will be using it again thanks for posting
5,the best recipe for homemade white bread ive ever tried it is moist and delicious with a hint of sweetness it is perfect my only regret is the fact that i love it hence i eat it waaaay too much
5,my whole family loves this bread and begs me to make more we have significantly cut out store bought bread and instead make this we have also used it as pizza crust and that was great too we made two pizzas out of one batch of dough but found the dough too thick a half recipebatch could make two pizzas or whole recipe for one loaf of bread amp two pizza crusts plan to try to add in whole wheat flour soon
5,i like to substitute honey for the sugar turns out great
5,great recipe for bread definitely nostalgic of when my mother used to bake it for us this recipe is enough for two loaves
5,excellent recipe for those asking about flour weight grams cup and oz cup i measure my flour on a scale for anything i make from scratch it makes all the difference
5,i am rating this based on looking for so long for a easy basic bread recipe this is exactly the basic bread recipe i have been looking for i have not made it yet but will very soon i am however concerned about how much bread it will make i have a small household so i am reaching out for advice has anyone tried to make only half of the recipe and also can this dough be frozen if i make the full amount and only bake one loaf of bread i love the other ideas of what i can make with it your suggestions are great
5,im rating simply for the other reviews ill try this next week as for answering the questions from cdj whether the dough can be halved _ yes i cant see any issues as for freezing the dough cant say for sure i dont usually freeze bread dough what i do is bake the whole recipe cool to room temp and divide each loaf into three for us that is the perfect size for a day or two i wrap the sections individually in plastic wrap then place into a freezer bag i grab out of the freezer as i need it thawing isnt an issue takes minutes or so
5,is there a bread machine version of the classic white bread
5,ive tweaked this a little to make it better for me atleast i use teas yeast only rise once it makes it a lot less dense i also changed the temp around somelower like degrees and it seems to make it even softer but still same time
5,tried this recipe for the first time and i was very pleased with the results i cant offer any suggestions for improvements very simple recipe if you follow directions precisely you will get some really great bread hope it stays fresh for a couple days definitely worth making again
5,just finished making this and its one of the best chicken pot pies ive ever eaten followed the recipe exactly and its amazingmost recipes online dont turn out so great but this one didid let it sit a little longer than min to set a little better but will be making this again and again
5,i made this recipe a couple weeks ago but didnt buy the second pie crust i froze the remaining mixture and after getting a second crust my other pie is now in the oven and i can hardly wait to eat it this is a very tasty recipe and i plan on making it in the future thank you
5,excellent recipe i like to make a double batch and freeze the filling then i can make pies later when im having a busy week this one is a keeper
5,great pot pie i used frozen mixed veggies and southern style hashbrowns to cut down on some of the prep
5,awesome recipemy husband and son loves chicken pot pie and i typically buy them fresh from a warehouse club been wanting to make a pot pie from scratch and found this recipe made it last night and hands down it was the best pot pie they have ever had i even ate it and i dont like pot pieplanning on making it agin and will swap out chicken with beef stew meat and beef broth
5,i love all the fresh ingredients my kids love this its a good way to get some vegetables in them the seasonings are perfect i dont change a thing
5,excellent time consuming but so with it
5,this is the best chicken pot pie i have ever eaten i dont usually write reviews but i had to join toh just to let everyone know that this recipe is amazing i followed the recipe exactly as written and everything is just delicious i wouldnt change a thing the seasonings are just right and it has become a staple in my house my picky eaters love this and my husband said that this is his favorite meal thank you for sharing such a delicious recipe
5,wonderful recipe i served it for a ministry appreciation dinner all the guests loved it as did my very finicky son inlaw i did alter it just a little by adding bay leaves removed before placing in casserole pie pans and tsp poultry seasoning i did this primarily because i was using rotisserie chicken and wanted to make sure i had full bodied flavor this recipe is a keeper
5,the chicken filling is the absolute best i have tried and will definitely make again as a personal preference though the only thing i would change is to only use crust on the top or top it off with puff pastry
5,made this today and my house smells so good gave one pot pie to my parents my dad just called to say how good it was waiting to put ours in the oven when hubby leaves work the filling is really good and was simple to make my only change was i used green beans instead of peas my dad hates peas and used top crust only will absolutely make this again
5,this is a fantastic pot pie recipe i was really impressed with how well the frozen one baked up when i was ready to use it
5,it was delicious we added tbsp of worcestershire sauce and tbsp of garlic powder
5,i dont usually do the cooking baking as my husband is a much better cook he asked for chicken pot pie today i searched for recipes and thought this one looked good it was great directions easy to follow good flavor omitted the thyme and fresh carrot used frozen veggies instead he said it was the best meal ive ever made we both had seconds and will see how second pie that we froze turns out in a week or two highly recommend this recipe
5,excellent recipe very easy to follow and super delicious definitely using this recipe again mixed different flour types worked as a charmthank you
5,ive baked bread all my life this is a very good basic recipe for bread and it spinoffs like cinnamon rolls some people i notice complain of the bread not rising either you got your yeast too hot with the water and killed it or did not take into account rising tempuratures or altitude do just make sure your yeast does not get too hot or cold and you should be fine
5,this is the recipe my mom used for years for bread and cinnamon rolls it always came out perfectly i cant make it to save my life because i hate making yeast bread it really does take minutes of kneading i dont have the patience the water has to be the correct temperature and the yeast has to be fresh if your yeast is expired toss it
5,use envelopes of dry yeast i did rose great i make challah and it uses to cups bread flour and requires pkts yeast
5,excellent tasty bread even my grandson liked it and very easy to makegoing to make more tomorrow
5,this is a very good basic bread recipe if yours didnt rise it was because of reasons other than the recipe i agree with others who commented earlier that either your water was too hot yeast too old or you made a mistake somewhere in your making the bread try again following the directions
5,excellent recipe many years ago a friend told me to buy a candy thermometer and to measure the temperature of the water to mix with yeast usually degrees this makes bread making much simpler
5,use this recipe in my bread machine and it never fails if you follow machine and yeast directions
5,i found this recipe doing a search for an easy beginners bread recipe i love this recipe it raises for me every time i have recently begun to experiment with it by making rolls and cinnamon rolls very simple very versatile recipe and it will stay in my favorite recipes notebook i will say to the naysayers get a candy thermometer and check your water temperature my coworker told me the easiest way to fail at bread making is to have your water or milk too hot when you add your yeast also check your yeast expiration date
5,i created an account just leave a review i am a novice baker baking for about two weeks now and my husband has been begging for years for a homemade bread recipe i finally broke down and googled homemade bread recipes and this was the first one i found and wow it came out so golden brown and delicious it rose beautifully and the recipe was so easy to follow my husband and i promptly devoured half the loaf once i pulled it out of the oven oops i am totally making pbampjs with this bread for tomorrows outing for me my husband and our son fantastic recipe thanks for sharing
5,i have made this bread several times over the past month and this is what i can tell you the first time i made it i used all purpose flour as the recipe called for the bread came out really good the second time i made it i used bread flour the bread came out really good in both the texture was good but just a bit different from each other then came and this time i used a combination of all purpose and bread flour results perfect phenomenal bread this had a great texture and taste and this will be the way i make it from now onok now i like a few others have found that cups of flour proves to be enough flourwhen i made bread tonight i made small loaves and a pan of cinnamon rolls my husband and grandson loved them they said the taste and texture were perfect
5,i have a son who doesnt like eggs butter and milk so i went looking for a bread recipe that dont have eggs butter or milk the bread that i usually make has butter and milk i tried this recipe and had great success i have added it as my standard bread recipe thanks to sandra anderson for submitting the recipe and to taste of home for publishing it
5,i followed the suggestion of using half all purpose flour and half bread flour i also needed full cups of flour i made one loaf of bread and rolled the other half out into twelve cinnamon rolls my dough raised beautifully i have a proofing setting on my oven and let the loaf rise for minutes which is about how much it took me to make the cinnamon rolls cinnamon rolls took about an hour to rise turned out great very easy dough to work with and this bread will go into my recipe rotation
5,excellent and easy bread recipe i put water on the top of the bread when it comes out of the oven and wrap it in a towel to steam this creates a softer crust also use wheat to white flour for a wheat bread
5,this is way easy to make i love it
5,best bread i have ever made tastes amazing my family loves it so simple to make and very little ingredients
5,delicious i used a heating pad to help the bread rise
5,so good and easy i ground up a cups worth of steel cut oats and flaxseed in a coffee grinder and added it in place of another cup of flour trying to eat healthier it turned out great and nice texture this bread rose much better than another recipe i used and looks beautiful
5,great bread i just substitute cup of water for cup of milk and stuffed one with shered mozzarella and the other with cherries yummy yummy thanks for this great recipe
5,made this today and not only is the recipe super easy it turns out so delicious a big hit in our house thank you for a wonderful bread recipe
5,thank you for such a marvelously easy bread recipe made this a couple of times i use all whole wheat flour and it makes a bread that tastes pretty much exactly like outback steakhouses bread helps with my diet because i try to cut preservatives and artificial ingredients out
5,super easy an so delicious
5,i love this site it has awesome receipts that i can make for my family sooooooo happy
5,such an amazing recipe just made it and my mom and dad loved it and so did i very simple a little lengthy process but totally worth it
5,very simple yet awesome recipe everyone could smell the warm delicious bread aroma from outside we all loved it
5,its not even finished yet n it already smells amazing ive tried a couple different bread recipes on here and i love them all
5,my whole family loved it i made two loaves and they were gone in two days
5,easy to make and substitute whole wheat for white flourit was delicious
5,this bread was excellent im so excited to have found this easy recipe i used honey instead of sugar and half whole wheat half all purpose flour delish thank you
5,this was the first time i have tried homemade bread and i will never try a different recipe it made very large loaves and i cant stop eating them i only have loaf pan so i decided to just forgo them and put both of my loaves on a nonstick air bake cookie sheet they came out beautifully i went about minutes until the internal temp was between and immediately after they came out i brushed the tops with olive oil it really softened it up but still has just enough of that homemade crunch im excited to try variations including whole garlic cloves apple and cinnamon chocolate pudding mix and chocolate chips and herbs and cheese we may never buy store bought bread again
5,absolutely the easiest and most delicious bread came out perfect the first time omg my husband and kids had the first loaf down by the evening will be making this on a regular basis i have had terrible success with my bread maker although i will continue to try to find the perfect recipe for it
5,ive always had issues making home made bread this recipe has not let me down yet the only thing i do differently is form the loaves by hand make a few slashes at the top for decoration and sprinkle a little corn meal on a greased cookie sheet it makes the loaves come off the pan easier these loaves go fast
5,delicious very easy we dont use sugar we use honey instead and it is just divine my loaf pans are slightly smaller so im able to break this into even loaves ive made it twice already loaves total never buying store bread again
5,two loaves were gone in one day family of ive used other recipes but this was hugely successful
5,my first time and it was perfect slices wonderful for sandwiches and delicious and myfamily loved it they said more more more
5,i really cant get over this bread i made batches every week i usually substitute cups of ap flour with whole wheat its just lovely actually i just made some except after letting it rise i took one loaf worth kneaded in about c raisins then rolled it out rubbed on some butter and sprinkled on cinnamon sugar tbspn cinnamon tbspn brown sugar and rolled it up let it rise and baked like the recipe says and ohmygoodness best raisin bread i have ever had just came out of the oven mmmmm
5,the first time i tried this my yeast was expired the water was too warm amp i didnt wait long enough for the yeast to dissolve needless to say the bread didnt rise and wasnt very good while the bad loaves were in the oven i started a new batch with fresh yeast in the right temperature water amp showed some patience letting it dissolve the result was beautiful loaves of bread such an easy recipe if you follow it i cant wait to try some of the suggested variations
5,this is my first homemade bread recipe and it will be my last there is no need to look elsewhere i dont knead it the minutes as directed usually minutes and it rises fine each time it will not rise as much with sea salt but i like the taste a little better believe it or not i am losing weight while eating this bread but only allow slices per day with little other carbsso you can lose weight and eat delicious homemade bread
5,easy peasy
5,we love this bread its so simple and easy to make and it tastes great my husband cant get enough and thats saying a lot since hes not much of a bread eater
5,i love this i started with the recipe as written down and it turned out beautiful each time i have started making this with whole wheat flour half allpurpose half whole wheat and making a cinnamon raisin version i read in one of the reviews that is awesome it is my first and last bread recipe and is sooooooo good
5,ive always had trouble finding the perfect bread recipe but i can finally quit looking this simple recipe bakes up perfectly and never disappoints
5,this recipe is very good thank you mine didnt rise well but that was my fault my house was to coola question for the person before me cmolina why on earth would you give a recipe a star because you didnt read the recipe
5,very simple basic bread recipe also good for fry bread after letting it rise and beating it down simply form into rounds and fry until crispy brown
5,made in a x glass pan min at powdered sugar not on ingredients list and didnt have any so just put carmel sauce on top very yummy
5,absolutely scrumptious definitely in the lets do this again category
5,this was one of the first recipes i made when i began subscribing to the taste of home magazine in the s i made the cupcakes for a outdoor concert i was going to on a summer evening delicious moist spice cupcakes with a wonderful butterscotch icing they were a big hit with my friends couldnt eat just one
5,yummy even my vegetablehating grandchildren loved these cupcakes they were moist and tasty even without the caramel topping with the caramel they were outofthis world ill have to plant more zucchini
5,im not sure that id reviewed this recipe before so ill do it now i used half and half cream instead of the milk for the frosting and followed recipe for the basic cupcakes however i baked cupcakes and three x loaves i iced the loaves right away and thinned frosting with about to tbsp more half and half cream this is a real winner of a recipe as it had been in one of the contests
5,i rarely bake anything that doesnt have chocolate in it but this recipe looked so good i had to try it i followed the recipe exactly and the cupcakes and frosting were scrumptious the only thing i would do differently would be to start checking them after minutes as they werent quite as moist as i would have liked when i removed them from the oven after minutes but i am definitely adding this to my list of favorite recipes
5,the first two loaves i made were gone in less than two days my kids were in love then i made two more and those were gone almost as fast i have now made a total of loaves and we stopped buying bread from the store i cook it mins baste them with butter and then cook them more minutes then i baste them again when i take them out i didnt have canola oil so i just use vegetable and its amazing
5,easy enough for my kids to help smells great baking and tastes wonderful yummy
5,huge hit with the family
5,very simple recipe i love that it only has ingredients and uses all purpose flour i did a cost analysis and this recipe costs me less than buying store bought bread it comes out to about per slice which is pretty cheap and it really doesnt require much effort it does take some time but most of that is from rising and baking and i can still do other tasks while thats happening so i think its worth it im definitely going to be using this as my goto bread recipe from now on my family loves it
5,love it
5,i use to have issues with my bread rising it was due to the yeast not activating properlynow i have no issues at allmake sire your water temp is close to spot on usualy luke warm will do the trick
5,great recipe my bread turned out perfect i do beat my bread down twice though to get a more even mix also in the recipe it says cups and on the side of the recipe it says over cups the cups is the correct one if you cant get your bread to rise its because youre missing over cups of flour
5,awesome i loved the taste and texture of the cake the icing was very sweet but still delicious i had a lot of icing leftover so i would halve the recipe for the icing next time this is definitely a winner
5,the zucchini cupcakes were very moist and flavorful i usually see zucchini cake paired with cream cheese frosting so i thought the caramel frosting was really unique and delicious
5,the icing was the best part of these the cupcakes themselves were quite delicious but the icing definitely topped these off
5,these cupcakes are excellent batter made cupcakes instead of doz only change i made was added cup raisins to batter at end i almost increased the frosting ingredients slightly
5,since we had many zucchini squash in our garden this year i used some to try this recipei wasnt sorry i did they are delicious
5,these cupcakes are absolutely delicious we always have so much zucchini in the summer this is a keeper i made the recipe as stated just doubled it and still feel like there arent enough to go around
5,made these for christmas i love these the icing is super easy and comes right out of the pan without sticking to it at all i put it in a ziplock bag and cut off the corner and wala perfect
5,i made these last summer when zucchini was in adbundance did make one change used lemon juice and zest instead of the orange juice lot of leftover frosting but why am i complaining delicious
5,these cupcakes were great
5,great flavor made
5,really enjoy these cupcakes the caramel frosting is such a great combination with the almond and spice flavor of the cake
5,i have an amazing zucchini muffin recipe that i have been using for decades but i wanted to branch out i was glad i did i liked the almond extract and the caramel frosting is terrific the texture is amazing too a nice not too dense but thick enough consistency cinnamon and cloves are just right and not overwhelming
5,i have been making these zucchini cupcakes since the recipe first came out in and it remains my favorite to this day i make it exactly as written it is perfect
5,delicious yummy frosting i have been making these for s few years now as soon as zucchini appears in my garden the cupcakes are never far behind
5,my sis made these i would have never made a zuchinni cupcake but i sure am glad she did now one of my favorites the combination of flavors is perfect the frosting is delicious
5,i took these cupcakes to work and they didnt last long
5,delicious
5,i have made these numerous times and everyone loved them the frosting is the socalled icing on the cake love these
5,i made these yesterday and they were fantastic the frosting was amazing and really took it over the top
5,took these to our bunco game night they were a hit i didnt have any orange juice or almond extract so i used lemon juice and lemon extract and they were very good moist and flavorful the frosting was just the needed touch of sweetness to the cupcake will definitely be making again
5,just made these following the recipe exactly very good it is also a very good nottoosweet muffin without the frosting adding raisins would be an option a keeper recipe
5,loved these cupcakes not overly sweet or heavy most of the sweetness comes from the frosting and the cupcakes wouldnt be near as good without it
5,im always looking for every possible way to use extra zucchini in the summer time this recipe was a wonderful sweet treat we really enjoy these
5,very nice recipe i like that the consistency is cake like rather than like many other recipes which are heavier and taste more like a muffin the icing tops this off beautifully and takes it up a notch for sure i peel my zucchini as is our preference people that dislike zucchini would not even know zucchini is in this when peel is not present as it just imparts a moisture to the cupcake raisins or pecans would be a great addition to the batter
5,these were fabulous loved the frosting but cupcakes are fine without it too didnt have any almond extract so finely chopped about a cup of almonds in it maybe thats why mine were great without the frosting too almonds added a touch more flavor and a bit of crunch
5,my neighbor across the street carolee and i both just happened to make these cupcakes carolee followed the recipe exactly except she used yellow squash instead of zucchini and used cups grated instead of cups she also put toasted walnuts on top of somei made them a bit differently i used vegetable oil instead of canola i used cups of grated zucchini instead of cups and i put the batter in a greased and floured x cake pan baked at degrees f for minutes i also added teaspoon of cinnamon to the icing and after icing the cake topped it with cup chopped and toasted walnutsboth versions were extremely tasty the cake is moist and not too sweet like some zucchini cakes the icing tops off the cake perfectly my cake tasted almost like carrot cake probably from the extra cinnamon in the icingwe will both be making this cake again five star rating for sure
5,just made these tonight and was very impressed i didnt double the icing recipe but did increase it a bit it made enough to ice dozen cupcakes and then some yes the icing was to die for i increased the shredded zucchini alittle cause i wanted more vegies in them i will definitely be making these again
5,love love love the frosting i wouldnt necessarily consider this a cupcake more like a quick bread however it is tasty i love the orange juice in the batter
5,super yummy i love these cupcakes and the frosting is delicious new favorite cupcake recipe
5,very moist my family loved them i didnt frost the cupcakes and we ate them as muffins with soup definitely making them again they freeze well too
5,very tasty moist cupcakes the caramel icing is out of this world with the spice cupcakes i will definately make these again when i have an abundance of zucchini
5,these zucchini cupcakes were a hit i took them to a potluck and they were gone in minutes i added oz of cream cheese to the batter because my frosting didnt whip up like i would have liked these are definitely worth trying
5,i ate some of these they were delicious she added about a cup cup of bluberries really good
5,these were so yummy i used ground all spice instead of ground cloves worked great
5,added applesauce for oil and orange extract for juiceawesome and nice and moist the frosting is very good will make again
5,these are delicious i didnt have orange juice so i substituted equal amount lemon juice and it worked well the frosting is delicious
5,these are delicious they are light textured and the frosting is easy they are not too sweet either just right i am so happy to have this recipe everyone who ate one thought they were just yummy i will make again and again always need zucchini recipes thanks
5,i made this recipe as written two times i have also just made them with whole wheat flour they are good either way frosting is delicious but not necessary
5,what a great way to use zucchini the frosting is to die for and its not even chocolate i double it and pile it on each cupcake i can easily get dozen from this recipe then theres more room for frosting
5,this is the second time ive made these they are very tasty and moist it took min for cupcakes i used cup sugar and i found them still a little too sweet i omitted the cloves because my family doesnt like them they are delicious even without the frosting
5,made it in a x and came out great hard to beat spiced cake and caramel frosting this will definitely be made again
5,ive prepared this several times and made some changes to it kicking it up a notch as ina would say first i use only fresh veggies except for the peas and pearl onions it adds time but fresh carrots parsnips and yukon golds make a difference next i add fresh mushrooms to the onion saute to keep this flavorful i roast chicken breasts that have been very well seasoned much better than rotisserie chicken and you can add the chicken juices to the stock upping the flavor considerably i also add a glug of sherry or white wine whichever is handy to the simmering sauce finally i use the tof sites buttery flaky pie crust as the topper it doesnt take long to make and i only let it sit in the fridge for about minutes and is delicious on this pie yes ive increased the work and time but if you do this is likely the best pot pie thats going to come out of your kitchen
5,so good really easy to prepare
5,this is a great recipe easy to make and tastes really really good i made no changes this time the next time it is made i will cut down on the thyme its a bit too overpowering for me other than that spot on and delicious
5,yumm i made it exactly per the recipe minus the frozen corn because i didnt have any but im not sure it needed it i may cut down on the thyme a bit next time and i did use low sodium chicken broth my husband says its stars he says its the best meal ive cooked
5,first this is called baked chicken pie not pot pie pot pie has no crust my grandparents born in were pa dutch so i know this to be true it is amazing how many things you can do with this recipe even using sea food for the baked chicken pie my grandmother always added a few hard boiled eggs diced made the gravy silky and adds a extra punch she also made gravy on the side in the event someone wanted theirs extra moist you cannot make and freeze these if you use hard boiled eggs i make multiple small ones in the aluminum pans and freeze them they are great to pull out and heat when its snowing outside
5,this was soooo good made exactly to recipe easy and the whole family loved it the grandkids had seconds even definitely a keeper
5,loved it so much i dont love putting pies together so instead i rolled out my pie dough and cut into squares which i baked individually we ladled the stew into bowls and topped with a piece of pie crust
5,i have made this several times and its a favorite hands down i put all the filling in one large pan instead of pie plates made my own crust for a crust pie and put it on top no bottom crust we dont like thyme much so subbed out the thyme and subbed in poultry seasoning delicious
5,made this and its totally awesome tried freezing it and the sauce turned to water so it doesnt freeze well but this is my new favorite the second time i made it i put in half the amount of potatoes and more chicken
5,this is a fantastic recipe i make it just as written except i sub fatfree half and half for milk because of my familys taste preferences i sometimes omit potatoes and use frozen carrotpea mix instead of fresh carrots i often add frozen green beans as well i use unsalted chicken stock to reduce sodium these taste perfectly fresh after several months in the freezer i wrap them in plastic wrap then put in a gallon ziplock to freeze def one of my top new recipes ive added this year the only problem is that its so good we eat too much
5,great recipe i didnt change anything except for i did make only one pie by using half of each ingredient
5,made this tonight absolutely delicious i usually make a recipe i got from the pioneer woman its similar and good but this is really really good i did mine as instructed but instead of making round pie plate pot pies i made one in my x stoneware dish and i only added pie crust i have an year old and my husband and theyre big eaters so this way to serve for us worked greati highly recommend this recipe you wont be disappointed its a keeper enjoy
5,made this on a cold winters night and it was a big hit the pan was wiped clean so needless to say its going in my recipe box
5,this is a good solid recipe ive been wanting to make a pot pie for years my grandma used to make them but i dont have her recipe so just beginning to experiment it was degrees and snowing so today was the dayi had to make it dairyfree so substituted the butter with bacon fat and just used a bit more broth and the liquid from the corn i used canned not frozen to replace the milk total abot cups liquid next time i think i will try oat milk in place of the dairy milk all we had in the fridge was almond milk and i didnt think that would work welli also cooked down some portobello shrooms about two cups before cooking in the pan first and added a cup or so of chopped celery along with the onions i pretty much followed all the other measurements oh added a bit of ground clove tooit was really great my two boys amp wife loved it it was gone in minutes i made just one pie only had one box of crusts in an extra deep stoneware pie pan and still have enough filling left over for probably another small pie but tomorrow is another snow day and i suspect the kids will warm it up and have it for breakfast thats how they roll
5,made this tonight i love it i did follow the recipe but have a deep dish pie plate and made just one hanging onto this one for sure
5,i didnt put on the frosting they didnt need it my husband thinks frosting is too sweet and i have to watch my sugar intake so a winwin all around this will be the zuke muffin recipe ill use from now on thanks oh i did use only half of the amount of the spices our preference
5,de
5,holy cow these are amazing so good
5,made this into a bundt cake came out delicious the orange juice makes it taste so goodgoing to make into zucchini bread grandkids loved it
5,delicious will be putting the frosting on a zucchini cake i am making
5,delicious cupcakes moist frosting is yummy
5,what a great recipe the cupcakes were moist and the icing was delicious
5,this is just excellent i followed the recipe exactly except i just had skim milk so added maybe tsp of cream when it was time to cool the frosting i put my pot in an ice bath and cooled it that way then kept the pot in the bath while beating in the powdered sugar i maybe added cup and it almost was too stiff unlike other reviewers concerns that they could not get it to a proper spreading consistency thanks for the recipe i will definitely use it again oh and it made large cupcakesmuffins
5,i had prepared this recipe quite sometime back i prepared it again i have adjusted this recipe by adding tbsp ground navel orange and i also added tsp each of allspice andnutmeg to the other spices and dry ingredients listed in this recipe i used cup shredded zucchini with cup unpeeled chopped tart apple rather than cups zucchini for the icing id used cups confectioners sugarthe cups didnt make for a good spreading consistency id also just melted the butter with the brown sugari didnt cube the butteri used evaporated milk and started with cup milk and gradually added up to tbspmore milk to achieve a desirable spreading consistency i did have to stir the frosting with a mixing spoon to make the icing pliable and easier for me to spread i also baked cupcakes minutes to make sure that they were golden brown and really baked thank youvirginia lapierre for sharing your recipe with taste of homethis recipe is a wonderful way to use zucchini delowenstein
5,theses cupcakes are awesome i am always looking for ways to use zucchini and these hit the spot the only change i made was that i didnt have almond extract so i used vanilla and i think they were just as good im not a huge fan of almond extract anyway the only other note is that the caramel frosting was more like a glaze i added the cups of x sugar and didnt want to add any more for fear it would be too sweet otherwise this is a keeper
5,oh my these are outstanding i followed the recipe exactly although for the frosting after cooking the brown sugarbutter mixture i transferred to a small mixing bowl and placed in an ice and water sink bath while beating in the powdered sugar used cups cupcakes fluffy caramel frosting oh my
5,these are awesome
5,wonderful moist and delightful unfortunately i was out of almond extract so i had to use vanilla next time ill definitely use almond ill also reduce the cloves to teaspoon as theyre a bit overpowering for my taste im sure ill be baking these again the caramel frosting is delicious and plentiful
5,wonderful recipe to use up zucchini these moist cupcakes can be made by themselves like muffins but the icing is absolutely divine always well received whenever i make them have used the icing recipe on apple and pumpkin cake
5,my whole family enjoyed this recipe they are great with and without the frosting
5,delicious i used cream cheese frosting because it is a family favorite great cupcakes
5,these cupcakes were absolutely wonderful one of the most delicious cupcakes i have ever had the only negative i can say is that the frosting wasnt really stiff enough to frost with so i just turned it into a glaze amp dipped the cupcakes in it still came out awesome amp will definitely make again
5,made this recipe as written except used vanilla instead of almond extract in the cake part so good moist amp sweet it made dozen cupcakes i didnt think there would be enough frosting but i only used half because its so sweet very good caramel flavor cupcakes are good without frosting too
5,excellent i doubled the recipe to make a sheet cake and a couple of variations to lighten up hopefully the recipe i subbed half of the eggs for whites half oil for apple sauce reduced sugar and added more apple sauce i didnt have orange juice so i added tablespoon of lemon juice per batch kids loved it thats all i need to know
5,these cupcakes were a great hit at a recent get together the caramel frosting combined with the cinnamon spice mixture in the cupcakes make this a perfect fall treat
5,i made these for a party at work and they flew off the table the creamy frosting adds just the right touch to a fabulous fall treat
5,i am rating this recipe as a family treat every year zucchini is out of control in the garden the family and work crowd loved it last year the recipe passed out to all this year though i am making mini cupcakes for the calorie conscious
5,oh man these were so yummy i was surprised that even my picky granddaughter loved them she ate two and was mad when we wouldnt let her have another i used vanilla rather than almond extract
5,these cupcakes are yummilicious my dad who doesnt usually like caramel frosting actually said they tasted good i had a little trouble thoughcouldnt get the frosting to thicken thanks to your grandma for an amazing recipe
5,the caramel icing is great
5,this recipe came out yeaer ago when my year old son was in preschool he loved these so much he wanted me to make them for his class on his birthday well needless to say a bunch preschoolers and the word zucchini did not go over too well but he was delighted
5,this is by far the best cupcake recipe out there the frosting is the crowning glory to this moist cake do not hesitate to make these only be prepared for everyone to ask you for this recipe
5,amazingly yummy the frosting was so good and the cupcakes were super moist the family loved them def make again
5,these are probably the best cupcakes i have ever tasted i have made them a lot over the last couple of years and always get rave reviews the last time i made them i did not have any orange juice but i did have apple juice so i used that instead they were actually better which i did not think was possible the apple juice changed the texture and they were much more moist and smooth i dip the top of the cupcakes in the frosting when it is still warm and it makes a nice smooth finish as i do not like as much frosting as it shows in the picture i also make these gluten free for my daughter and substitute gluten free flour and i cant tell the difference i freeze these for her and they are wonderful even months later out of the freezer
5,this is a great way to use zucchini from the garden the last time i made them i substituted c of the oil with lemon olive oil and added the zest of one lemon plus added about c soft cream cheese to the frosting they disappeared yum
5,this cupcake is so moist and deliciousi had to play with the frosting a bit to get it to the right consistency but the flavor is out of this world
5,made this tonight great flavors they blended so well thanks so much these are so moist and delicious
5,i seriously think these are the best things that i have ever eaten the cupcakes were so moist and yummy and the frosting oh wow delicious if you leave them unfrosted they are more like a muffin and are still very good but really though you want the frosting
5,this was a great hit as treats my sons birthday party
5,this was a great hit as treats my sons birthday party
5,the frosting is heavenly great way to sneak veggies into the kids
5,i have made this recipe many times it is delicious very moist amp icing is wonderful adds so much flavor to the very moise cupcake i always have an abundance of zucchiniyou cannot go wrong with this recipe thankyou
5,just made this on the request of my soninlaw after i posted them on facebook they are very good i used allspice instead of cloves because i didnt have cloves and they were rather pricey in the store i also made cupcakes and put the rest in a loaf pan because i only had one cupcake tin the loaf was good too though a little small i will definitely be making these as an alternative to cupcakes would be good for breakfast or a midday snack if you left the frosting off the frosting was also very good and easy to make
5,such a good recipe love the spice flavors in it i used ground allspice in place of the cloves and it is delicious the caramel icing finishes it off perfectly
5,so very good they are much like a muffin until you put that heavenly icing on them wow
5,they were amazing i used zucchini fresh from the farmers market my kids loved them and we shared them with the grandparents
5,these were delicious granted my frosting looked nothing like the picture not as fluffy but the taste of both the cupcakes and the frosting was outstanding this won rave reviews with my family the neighbor kids and my coworkers i made a dozen cupcakes for home and then used the rest of the batter to make a small cake that i took to work everyone loved the frosting and i had a bunch left over so i used it on some glutenfree apple muffins id made for my daughter since she couldnt eat these would definitely make these again and am going to experiment with a gf version and with using more zucchinimy husband tried to get me to agree that he could have as many as he wanted since they contain veggies hahah
5,i made these cupcakes on a whim for a potluck picnic they were delicious and i had many requests for this recipe
5,these cupcakes are the best my kids loved them which was the best part but when i did the frosting it started to meltnest time ill add more cofectioners suger
5,really delicious probably the best cupcakes ive ever made the frosting is perfect and a great recipe alone its a wonderful blend of a branny taste with a sweet one
5,very tasty since i have an abundance of zucchini it was a perfect use for somefrosting was great also a keeper for sure
5,very good these were moist and not too sweet or too veggie delicious
5,made this for a party we were having amp everyone loved them i changed them a little to make them gluten amp dairy free by using dairy free margarine instead of butter amp sorghum flour amp xanthum gum instead of allpurpose flour they turned out great amp no one could tell that they were gluten free
5,huge hit everyone loved mine which i did modify a bit i didnt have oj so used lemonade i figured it was citrusy and would add the needed tang but i didnt think that cloves would work well with the lemon so i skipped that and for the same reason used vanilla extract instead of almond these were light and airy a good cake texture the icing was fabulous a new family favorite let your caramel mixture cool since i didnt have the time to wait i cooled it in a ice bath wonderful recipe
5,great cupcakes stars
5,moist amp delicious
5,i love this recipe great use for all the zucchini in the garden i am lucky to live in an area with an olive festival so i have meyer lemon olive oil substituted c of that for part of the canola oil and added the zest of a lemon super fragrant and a great added touch
5,so easy amp so moist everybody loved them
5,wow i made the recipe as directed i did put the icing saucepan in a bowl of ice water when i was beating the icing so it chilled fasterthe cupcake is very delicately spiced and the caramel icing is sooo yummy fortunately i prepared them to share with friends otherwise i think my family would have wiped out the whole batch on their own
5,these were fabulous the icing is so tasty but very sweet i did have to add extra powdered sugar to get the right consistency the next time that i make these i am going to try adding cream cheese to the frosting i think the cupcakes were better the second day as the favors had time to meld
5,the better one that i eat
5,one word phenomenal
5,great recipe made these for partythere were none left
5,delicious i put chopped walnuts on top of the frosting
5,rave reviews from everyone do not skip the frosting that makes it and the bonus is that now i can make my own caramel without the high fructose corn sryup that all store bought has excellent i changed things a bit a bit more spices less salt cups of zucchini and i also replace some of the wheat flour with oat flour for a more healty benefit result it was more moist with extra cup of zucchini and also healthier incredible
5,these cupcakes were amazing and we all loved the caramel frosting too this will be my go to recipe for zucchini from now on
5,i like this recipe but would substitute vanilla for the almond extract as i think it would overpower the more earthy cinnamon and cloves also i would suggest adding chopped nuts to the batterwalnuts or pecansmaybe a cup depending on your preferencealso for the frosting i think you would run into problems adding the melted butter brown sugar and milk with the confectioners sugar as a preference i would subsitute skim milk for the i would do the icing a bit differently warm the milk and brown sugar on the stove until the sugar dissolves soften butter slightly in the microwave then place in a stand mixer and mix until smooth add confectioners sugar and mix add cooled brown sugarmilk mixture to the above and mix until the frosting is combined add additional confectioners sugar to achieve a spreadable consistency for frosting
5,i forgot to add for the frosting after the milkbrown sugar cooks remove from heat and add the vanilla cool
5,i received free over grown yellow squash so i substituted them for the zucchini it was delicious
5,awesome smells delicious and tastes even better
5,the recipe made so i shared them with my parents and some of their neighbors at a senior complex everyone loved them frosted or unfrosted great zucchini recipe
5,made this tonight it was awesome my husband loved it been making a pot pie for years that has cheese in it but this one takes the prize cut recipe in half and only made one tonight anxious to make again and try freezing one
5,this is so delicious there are a lot of steps but it is worth it
5,this pot pie is amazing i tried the recipe without the thyme and added some onion salt and seasoning salt and it was absolutely delicious
5,i really liked this pot pie it was delicious and it made pies so i got to freeze one and have it the next week perfect if you are making dinner for another family who needs the help
5,ive used this recipe several times i love it i use it for turkey pot pies too and adjust the herbs it is an excellent way to use up roast turkey and freeze pies for later
5,i have been making this recipe for several years and its a favorite for everyone ive fed it to my kids in particular love it to save prep time i use oz frozen diced potatoes and oz frozen mixed veggies i also decreases the thyme to tsp i do end up making pies using these amounts lately my kids have decided they dont like the crust as much so i only put crust on the top its definitely time consuming to make but having spare in the freezer makes it worth it plus i love it so much the reheat from frozen instructions are spot on if you havent tried this you are missing out
5,this is such a versatile and great recipe i double recipe and freeze extra in pans without crust put crust in a pan add filling and bake
5,i followed the recipe but left out the potatoes dint want to over starch or whatever and no chicken as i dont eat it added steak seasoning and onion salt i used frozen veggies i used pork shoulder that i made a few days earlier it was delicious now if i had known pot pies were this easy i feel so silly buying them my store bought pie crust wasnt any good so i had to improvise with pizza dough yummm
5,this is the best chicken potpie i have ever tasted this is a keeper thank you for the recipe
5,so my fiance and i are both pretty indifferent to chicken pot pie but i found myself browsing recipes in order to use some extra chicken i had before it went bad i found this recipe and decided to give it a try upon eating one bite he says this has to go into the rotation we both then devoured the tastiest chicken pot pie ever created i did do a few things differently i seared chicken breast strips in vegetable oil that i coated in garlic powder salt pepper and italian seasoning i was out of thyme and thought the italian seasoning might add the missing flavor to the dish i used one whole can of drained carrotts and half the amount of the rest of the items the recipe called for after adding the cubed chicken i cooked prior the recipe was still enough for pies i did not have pie crusts so i used my largest round corningware casserole dish in place of a pie pan which provided room for the entire mixture it worked perfectly this is definitely in the rotation from now on
5,yummyyou do not need to look for another pot pie recipethis is it
5,this is the quintessential pot pie the flavors are spot on this was exactly what i was looking for thank you
5,this is a very easy recipe to make the texture of the cupcakes are firm almost like a sponge cake they have just the right amount of flavor i could not pick up on the orange juice flavor in the cupcakes i followed this recipe exactly however if you are not a fan of cloves you could easily leave them out and not ruin the flavor i would suggest if using frozen zucchini to let it thaw in a strainer firstthe caramel frosting was very easy to prepare and flavorful i used a bag to pipe it on i also helped cool it down by continuously beating with my mixer in a bowl of ice this way i could add the powdered sugar faster and the frosting became a nice texture quicker very good made a double batch the first time would definitely make again
5,i made this recipe recently for the cupcake i followed the recipe exactlyii
5,i made mini cupcakes for my husband to take to work half frosted the other half plain i ate one of each and they were moist and delectable my husband thought i was crazy and said no one is going to eat zucchini cupcakes they were gone by the end of the day and two weeks later he came home with a special request to send in more
5,everyone that i shared the muffins with loved them the recipe is now in my recipe box
5,i just love these about as much or more than pear muffins
5,with the frosting it is definitely a dessert without it you could call it dessert or a muffin depending upon your individual taste although i love chocolate chips in zucchini cakebread as much as the next person it really is refreshing to have this one sweetened by the caramel icing its an original and a flavor combination that works for me
5,this recipe is awesome
5,after an abundant supply of zucchini i made these cupcakes several times this summer some went to work and many stayed home i got rave reviews for these and even several requests for the recipe as a toh field editor i would highly recommend this recipe it is an exceptionally easy recipe to make the cupcakes were delicious and the icing was good also if you wish to speed the icing process up a bit you can place the cooked part in ice and use an electric mixer this way you can get to the finished product sooner i froze several packets of zucchini premeasured just to make these in the winter try these you wont be dissapointed
5,i made these for the women i worked with and they love them even the younger girls loved them they could notbelieve the cupcakes had good for you zucchini in them one lady said she didnt like zucchini but she loved the cupcakes and wanted the recipe
5,great way to use zuchinni from my garden
5,these cupcakes were so good my family loved them i made them in the morning and they were a nice snack for breakfast i would definitely make these a lot
5,mouth watering everyone i made these for loves them
5,great alternative cupcake family thought they tasted like pumpkin pie in a cupcake wrapper
5,i brought these to work and they were a hit many of my coworkers were suprised that they were zucchini cupcakes a couple of people thought that the frosting was a little too sweet so next time i will try the suggestions listed here wonderful recipe
5,i used rice flour instead to make gluten free and everyone loved them
5,these are so good its such a nice alternative to zucchini bread and my kids love them
5,wow these cupcakes are great the icing certainly sets these cupcakes apart from the many other recipes available we made some to share with neighbors and they also enjoyed them much
5,so good
5,these cupcakes are moist and have a great deal of flavor i also sometimes substitute cream cheese frosting for the caramel frosting still is a big hit for any event
5,this was a great recipe very tasty cupcake a bit like a spice cake and the frosting went so well with it caution the frosting is very sweet but it frosting
5,these were great not oily like most zucchini recipes for my cooking class we used a giant zucchini and scooped out the seeds we also cut the amount of cloves to teaspoon and doubled the recipe which yielded delicious cupcakes dont skip the frosting it was almost like fudge yum
5,very good frosting was very sweet but that can easily be solved by not putting as much on how could you complain nice spice i can imagine how they would make good gluten free too
5,these are amazing no one is ever going to know that i am using up my zucchini this way they are so moist and yummy
5,outstanding
5,i made these cupcakes with my granddaughter and they were delicious she carefully spooned the flour into the measuring cups without packingand mixed together dry ingredients just until flour was blended her cupcakes were soooo tenderquite by mistake we ended up making maple bar icing instead of frosting by adding two sticks butter instead of one and some additional confectioner sugar so icing could be swirled around on top of cupcakes my oh my was it ever delicious will try the frosting recipe next time but will be keeping the maple bar icing for this cupcake as well excellent treat for all ages
5,absolutely fantastic like everyone said i expected nothing less i too like others cut down the sugar and they were still fantastic could probably cut even more as icing makes up the sweetness these tasted fantastic even without icing
5,i like trying new things and my mother was talking about making zucchini bread which i dont believe i have ever eaten but for some reason sounded good i came across this recipe i love carmel so the idea of a carmel frosting on top sealed the deal i just completed baking and frosting my cupcakes they are pretty good like a spice cake as one review said they werent as moist as i had imagined from the reviews i think i will make them bigger next time i dont believe i made them big enough for the moistness the carmel frosting is definitely worth the time and effort it takes to make it i know i will use it on cakes and other things it is delicious i put the left over frosting in the fridge to put on brownies or something later or just eat like carmel thank you for the healthy alternative to normal cupcakes we will see what my coworkers think of it tomorrow when i take it to work
5,i absolutely loved these you would never guess they have zucchini in them very good even the icing is delicious
5,these were heavenly but next time i am doubling the caramel sauce and saving half to drizzle over the frosting it was sooo good
5,im not a big zucchini fan but i loved these my fiance and his kids really like zucchini so i thought id try it i was really impressed and the caramel icing was very good i definitely will make these again
5,omg made for a barbque all i haveto say is everyone was asking the recipe they lasted a whole hr on table friends wanted more lol i made batches for people

5,ive been making these since the original recipe came out in toh my kids grew up eating these almost every summer and sometimes with frozen zucchini in the winter a truly awesome way to use zucchini and enjoy a delicious treat as well
5,i am a vegan so dont use eggs butter or dairy milk when cooking i substituted tbls of water tbls of ground flaxeed for each egg used like other reviewers i also substituted applesauce for the oil and reduced the cloves to tsp as for the frosting i skipped the one presented here although i could have used vegan butter substitute soy milk and vegan cream cheese and instead made a streusel topping using c flour tbls brown sugar tsp ground cinnamon tsp ground allspice or you could also use pumpkin pie spice tbls canola oil and c coarsely chopped pecans all mixed together and sprinkled on top of cupcakes before they went into the oven yum
5,just made these cupcakes what a great recipe so moist and a great way to use up that zucchini

5,were easy to make tasted greatquite moist did add some cream cheese to the original frosting
5,made the cupcakes for friends and it was a big hit great way to use up the extra zucchini in the garden the almond extract makes it unique it is also delicious with philadelphia cream cheese frosting although the maple is very good and easy to make cream cheese gives it a different but excellent flavor also
5,wow this is a great recipe i did add nuts and raisins i will make this again and again
5,i have been making these for years they are my daughters favorite she especially loves the icing they are so moist most of the time people wrinkle their nose when i tell them what are they then they are asking for the recipe as soon as they taste of them
5,ive been making these cupcakes for years from the original recipe printed in a toh magazine from the s they are outstanding the cupcakes are moist and spicy the frosting is wonderful i do end up with more frosting than i need though
5,pmay i addi scooped out all the zucchini seeds prior to shredding the zucs also i put the shredded zuc in a colander for a while and pressed some of the excess juice out i had maybe a tablespoon of liquid drain off the zucsp

5,i tried these cupcakes and gave them away everyone just loved them i had to try one for myself since i was getting such great reviews they are great i most definitly will make them again but keep more than one for myself

5,very good cupcakes great spice flavor in the cupcake combines really well with the caramel frosting my husband said its the best cupcake hes ever had i made them exactly as written it made exactly perfect size cupcakes will definitely keep this recipe handy to use often
5,really good i used apple juice instead of orange and cream cheese icing worth making again
5,between having a crazy amount of zucchini to use and it being a lovely cool day my friend and i wound up at this webpage and we just gotta say delicious the spice and caramel combination is just awesome
5,these are absolutely wonderful
5,these cupcakes are great i reduced the sugar in the cakes to cup and they were still plenty sweet enough
5,these spicy cupcake are awesomethis will be made over and over
5,this is a very good recipe thanksyes drain the zucchini
5,firstly i never peel or seed my zucchini my moms recipe for the cupcakes are similar so i just used hers i made the frosting and it was more like a glazeshould i cool it completely before adding conf sugar instead of putting it in when its lukewarm it definately did not look like the picture i then added a pack of cream cheese and more conf sugar and it turned out fabulous
5,followed anothers advice and cut the sugar to cup replaced a little over half the oil with applesauce baked in bread loaf pans one with walnut pieces another with blueberries at for min cut the frosting recipe in half and added more milk to make a glaze yummy
5,i have made these for years and my kids gobble them up i never drain the zucchini and they always come out moist and perfect
5,sooooooo delicious cant wait to make them for my grandchildren and agape celebration at church great even without the frosting
5,delicious love the frosting
5,very delicious but for me id cut the cloves by half or leave them out and use applesauce instead of oil my family enjoyed the smell of these as they were cooking just as much as when they got to eat them will definitly use the frosting on other breads yummy
5,absolutely scrumptious i am with the reviewer sillygirl i do not peel or seed my zucchini or squeeze out moisture i used a smallish tender zucchini the cupcakes turned out beautifully i wasnt sure about the frosting either although it turned out ok and tasted outrageously fabulous next time i will add cream cheese and more confectioners sugar to make the frosting more fluffy but still have that fabulous carmel taste the flavors are the best great recipe find thanks loved it
5,omg these are wonderful i made them yesterday and another batch today the icing is really good and i also did some with a cream cheese icing and they even taste just as good with no icing
5,great recipe very easy to make and everyone enjoyed them
5,best pot pie recipe ive ever found we dont care for thyme so left that out and still wonderful
5,i am a young senior and a well seasoned cook and baker pun intended i know there will be some who will start clucking under their breaths when i say i havent made this exact recipe but is is very close to one my mother who was a fabulous cook taught me years ago i read a lot of the reviews because there are so many and i want to make comments based on what i read and my level of experience because there are so many who commented on there being too much thyme in this recipe i would suggest that if you do not use thyme regularly that you add the amount suggested in increments if youre not use to more heavily spiced foods start off with a quarter of a teaspoon then sample it not enough add another quarter of a teaspoon and sample it again if you like that amount you dont need to add the full teaspoon flavours become more pronounced as they cook and have time to combine with other ingredients spicing is a very personal thing and so you should always try a bit if you are concerned there is too much of anything you will not get zapped by lightening if you adjust the seasonings to your own personal preferences and it does not mean the recipe is not great the person who submitted the recipe likes the seasoning based on her familys taste buds but it doesnt mean it cant be adjusted to your own the same goes for any other recipe have some teaspoons ready to sample recipes as you go personalize to your hearts content it really irritates me when people comment about throwing food out because they dont know how to make it more palatable i do have to remind myself though that not everyone had a mother like mine or had home economics classes in high school though they didnt teach me much i hadnt learned at home cooking and baking can be so much fun and life is too short to get so caught up on minor issues remember add a pinch or so sample and add more till it is to your taste baking has to be a more precise exercise because there has to be an exact ratio of rising agent as an example to other dry ingredients and liquids used again flavouring is a very personal matter i would like to thank karen johnson for submitting this recipe that makes this potpie from scratch with no condensed soup and artificial flavours to quote from a book called siddhartha by herman hesse i read in my early s knowledge is communicable wisdom is not one of my moms favourites we get too soon old and too late smart
5,thank you regi m for your review so glad you took the time to give such helpful information and share the knowledge that you have acquired from your experience
5,this recipe is probably one of the best pot pie recipes ive eaten very filling
5,awesome flavor and relatively easy to make i added stalks of celery and omitted the boiling of the carrots and potatoes as i had diced them fairly small when i make again i will boil the carrots and celery as they were still a little crunchy but red potatoes were perfect as is as a personal preference the gravy made with the flour was a bit too thick and i think i would cut the flour in half next time to make it a little easier to fill in the gaps for the pie
5,best ever pot pie we added garlic to the onions and rosemary and parley to the spices moisture and texture were a concern but it was perfect we all loved it
5,making this for the second time tonight i use king arthur flours chicken pot pie crust recipe along with this recipe and the results are simply fantastic substituted onion salt heavy cream and celery and mushrooms no potatoes also used bouillon cubes just awesome
5,excellent as written i love that this contains no canned soupsthough i do use them for convenience sometimes i used rotisserie chicken for this love the tip about the slumped crust i learned something new lynne volunteer field editor
5,this was really good the only thing i did different was instead of adding the carrots i used frozen peas and carrots next time i might try adding mushrooms though its good without them too ill make it again for sure
5,such a wonderfully comforting and delicious filling i used my own butterbased pie crust recipe and made the filling as per the directions great comfort food my husband said it was the best chicken pot pie hes ever had
5,its perfect theres no a thing id change
5,absolutely amazing i made crust from scratch because i didnt have store bought on hand and im excited to see how much easier it is with a rotisserie chicken and packaged pie crust my son is allergic to dairy so i used earth balance buttery spread sticks instead of butter and unsweetened original plant milk instead of whole milk and the whole family chowed down like it was their last meal on earth
5,i freeze the filling and pull out two ready made pie crusts right before baking one deep dish and one regular yum
5,i love this recipe i make it all the time i halve the sugar in the sauce as a preference and it comes out perfectly still sweet and just perfect for our family it is one of my familys trusted favorites thank you for the recipe
5,mu husband loves meatloaf but i have never liked it i generally find them really dry no matter how much ketchup you drown it i reluctantly tried these and i love them very easy to make moist and full of flavor great as left overs also i do use a meat mix of lb each of ground beef veal and pork i also add some hot sauce to the ketchupsugar topping for a little more kick and to balance the sweetness this is a repeat recipe
5,used half regular ketchup half jalapeno ketchup so good made a double batch baked them cooled them and then froze them solid on cookie sheets and vacuum sealed them
5,i liked the review of using jalapeno ketchup so i diced up a fresh jalalpeno and added it to the meat mixture it was very good i liked the cheese inside the meatloaf have never done that before
5,i made this recipe exactly as written i love it i will definitely be making this on a regular bases i wonder how well it would freeze freeze before or after cooking the sauce is very good perfect glaze
5,my family fell in love with this and keep asking for it again we give it stars
5,wow are these good my husband who does not really like zucchini really loves these cupcakes
5,with the abundance of zucchini in our garden it made sense to try this recipe and am i glad i didi took the cupcake to work and everyone raved about them the ones i left at home the kids ate up and wanted more i did not frost my cupcakes and no one noticedi actually shred my zucchini and vacuum seal it in cup bags then have it in my freezer when i want the taste of summer in the middle of the winterthanks for sharing the recipe it is awesome
5,i like to make these cupcakes with only half of the frosting they are pretty sweet with the whole amount i have also served them without the frosting
5,great cupcake the frosting was yummy
5,best cupcakes i ever made great cake amp great frosting they compliment each other so well
5,this is our new favorite zucchini recipe the frosting is just like my mother in laws danish fudge
5,pi have already written something about this recipe but i have to write again previously i used my moms zucchini recipe and this frosting recipe i decided to try this recipe just as it is written and they were incredible i did not drain the zucchini eitherand there was a lot of liquid too this is how good they arei first made them and accidentally added third cup sugar instead of and a third cup my bad handwriting my nephews and nieces ran in from outside and grabbed one even though i told them what i did they were all gone in less then minutes i personally didnt care for them but they still raved about how good they were i then made a second batchto me it was much betterp
5,i have been making these for years very tasty and cook quickly leftovers reheat nicely
5,this is the same recipe my year old mother made and it has always been a hit with everyone who is lucky enough to have a slice the only thing we did not include is the cheese however i just recently made it exactly as the recipe states and the cheese is a wonderful rich addition love this recipe its definitely a keeper
5,these are hands down the best meatloafmeatballs recipe i have ever tried its a win every single time
5,i made this as two loaves my only changes were to use onion powder and i cut the topping in half i have made it a few times and the kids really like it
5,my boyfriend absolutely loved these
5,i make two changes first i enshroud the peas in a ball of mashed potatoes the kids get a kick out of discovering the peas and not having to chase them all over there plates i also brown the potatoes in the oven second instead of the ketchup topping i make a good brown gravy that covers the meat loaf and potatoes yum yum
5,very easy and very tasty this will definitely be a goto dinner for me
5,my family loved this recipe yummy
5,made this with my daughter used a little less milk as i read in the reviews came out amazing will be making this again
5,excellent recipe i add my own seasonings to the meat to add even more flavor try it you wont be disappointed thanks for the recipe
5,since i tried this recipe it is my goto meatloaf everyone enjoyed
5,grandkids loved these and opa for a sandwich for work
5,these were easy to make and delicious mine werent as neat looking as the picture and i shouldve diced the onions smaller the flavor of the sauce is excellent i will definitely make these again
5,great recipe
5,i have been making this recipe for years from an early addition of taste of homemy husband is very picky and this is by far his favorite meatloaf recipei have also made it as large meatloaves and taken it to church potlucks never any left
5,this is my go to recipe any time i make meatloaf my family loves it
5,it took more cooking time then the recipe stated at least to minutes and i used seasoned breadcrumbs instead of oats and the recipe was amazing i will definitely be making this again
5,this is my favorite meatloaf recipe ever ive been making these super tasty meatloaves since i make loaves instead of and cook for minutes i also cover the pan with foil for the first minutes
5,loved by everyone i doubled the recipe but did not double the cheese or the brown sugar the sauce was plenty sweet and could maybe even do with less sugar my husband said this was his favorite meatloaf recipe
5,i dont make any other type of meatloaf except these lil cheddar mini meatloaves my entire family mom sisters mothinlaw all love this recipe always a hit
5,best ever i add bell peppers to it and usually double or triple it so i can freeze some for another meal i have taken it to family reunions as meatballs and everyone wanted the recipe
5,these are the best meat loaf ves we have ever tried my entire family loves them just delicious
5,these are my goto weeknight meatloaf recipe they bake faster because they are single loaves and the cheesy flavor is great left overs can be frozen for future meals
5,no question about it this is a great meatloaf recipe made according to directions the mini idea made these cute and easy serving in our opinion you could make half the sauce and still be delicious as a volunteer field editor with taste of home i love preparing classic dishes with a new twist
5,we have been making cheddar loaves twice a month since the recipe first appeared in i like to add dry minced onion to the topping and a little worcestershire sometimes i make the loaves around a cube of sharp cheddar instead of grated because some of the grated cheese cooks out
5,love this meatloaf recipe been making it for years now thanks for sharing the recipe
5,these are the best just had them last night for dinner the only change because of preference is using a small can of tomato paste instead of ketchup started making these in when they were in the annual toh book my son would say if he was ever on death row and had to choose his last meal it would be these i promised him i would make them whenever he wanted so he wouldnt have to commit a crime to have them for dinner
5,my husband especially enjoys these moist tasty meat loaves i often make these and freeze them when they cool
5,this is a very delicious way to make meat loaf i do not make them individually though i make one large meat loaf sometimes i use mozzarella cheese also
5,these little meat loaves are wonderful my wife really loves them
5,i made a few loaves without ketchup for my picky little eaters we loved it thanks for the recipe toh
5,i have been making this meatloaf since i first saw it in the aprilmay issue back in i still have the original recipe that i cut out and have now laminated that is how amazing this recipe is when i first met my husband years ago he hated meatloaf i tried many recipes and he literally hated them all until i made this one i have never made any other meatloaf since we first made this recipe it is super easy to make and it turns out perfectly delicious every single time the sauce is absolutely amazing i have never changed a thing and everyone who tries it loves it now that we are in our s we are trying to watch what we eat so i decided to substitute ground turkey for the ground beef and i kept everything else the same perfect it was even more moist than normal beef or turkey this recipe is absolute perfection
5,love this even my picky eater husband loved it
5,my aunt brought these fantastic meat loaves to a family reunion about years ago i have been making them ever since and my family absolutely loves them
5,this was excellent the loaves were so tender and the cheese oats and glaze gave them incredible flavor this may just be my new goto meat loaf recipe if you dont want to make individual loaves you can probably make one large loaf and adjust the cooking time i will definitely make these little loaves again and againvolunteer field editor
5,these are wonderful my husband agrees they will now be our go to meat loaf recipe just delicious i wouldnt change a thing
5,these little gems are so tasty i keep a few without sauce because one of my kids prefers them that way i used ground bison and they are simply delicious im a volunteer field editor and i love trying and reviewing recipes this one does not disappoint
5,hasnt anyone noticed the bake time is different from the total time comment to the directions it is minutes love these
5,quick easy and flavorful
5,what a great recipe i love the presentation and it helps with portion control we freeze them and pull them out whenever we want meatloaf instead of trying to shape my own loaves i use a loaf miniloaf pan works great it does make a lot of sauce however could probably cut the sauce in
5,just made it tonight excellent
5,omg this is awesome we went glutenfree for medical reasons about two years ago and i have been looking for a good meatloaf recipe ever since i made this with glutenfree quick oats and it was perfect we both loved this
5,my family loves this meal espically if you add bacon yum
5,absolutely love this
5,my family loved it very easy to make
5,making this again tonight because it is a favorite at our house the flavor and consistency are great when hot and even better the next day on a sandwich i make my mini loaves bigger than suggested loaves instead of one pound of meat only serves here
5,a friend brought these over after i had my first baby very good
5,a family favoritemade at least once a month
5,this smells fantastic when it is in the oven and it tastes as good as it smells
5,quickly became a family favorite i have two tips one replace half of the ketchup in the sauce with your favorite bbq sauce and two double the recipe because there will be no leftovers
5,this is a wonderful recipe i also added some horseradish for a little zing
5,easy and delish the kids loved them too
5,my daughter said that this was her favorite meatloaf recipe sauce tasted great and i love that this bakes much faster than a whole meatloaf
5,my husband and i agree that its the best chicken pie recipe weve tried but i agree with sfcollins about reducing the flour a bit thank you for sharing this recipe bw
5,everyone loves this all of my boys and husband devour these pies weve often had guests over and they have always raved about it
5,great i add more chicken a tbsp of chicken soup base paste and then omit the regular salt

5,i love this recipe i use this recipe at home and at my job
5,to be brutally honest this is very close to the chicken pot pie recipe found in the older versions of betty crocker cookbooks which is the best recipe ive ever tasted while homemade crust is better in my opinion its also far more time consuming this is a quick and easy recipe and the filling is right on the money if somehow you come out with a bland meal after using a full cup of butter youre doing something wrong
5,best potpie ive ever had hands down subs ive made in the past include using rabbit in place of chicken and subbing cauliflower in for the potatoes ill be making this one for a long time
5,halved recipe added tsp of bells poultry seasoning and used tater tots instead of pie crust its in the oven now and it smells really good we cant wait to eat it
5,my husband said this potpie was the best ive ever made i added celery with the onions and boiled carrots and potatoes in chicken broth then used the broth to make the sauce topped with tater tots instead of crust
5,the best i make my own crust and that is the only change i make
5,really satisfied my craving for chicken pot pie and is easy to make
5,yum loved these
5,i never cared for meatloaf but i love these they are very moist we usually double all the ingredients except for the sauce and it is perfect

5,this recipe is what my husband and i call oh my god good we loved it it was by far the best recipe for meatloaf i have ever tried just as little fyi try to use ground beef with the lowest fat content you can find otherwise the splatter and smoke while baking gets a little out of control lol

5,i was told not to put the leftovers in the freezerthey would be gone by tomorrow high praise in this home
5,ive made this many times its a family favorite
5,to maikoemi after reading your review i thought not doing it when i checked at minutes there were lots of liquid i had to set the oven at for another minutes or more until it was drier i think you did not waited until the liquid evaporated actually it is pretty good and not soft at all
5,i just tried this for the first time and my family loves it i did have to cook a little longer but i also made a full size loaf i also drained excess liquid during cooking i also used bison meat i wil definately make again
5,best meatloaf recipe ever been making it for years and have passed it on to many family members who also love it
5,yummy have been making for years very moist was great for feeding my son when he was a toddler and wanted to eat what we were eating also like the extra dairy in there great way to sneak into my sons diet as hes not a very good milk drinker
5,yummy have been making for years very moist was great for feeding my son when he was a toddler and wanted to eat what we were eating also like the extra dairy in there great way to sneak into my sons diet as hes not a very good milk drinker
5,instead of using prepared mustard i used yellow mustard it was very good i will make it again
5,made it many times now amp my family loves it
5,made this last night was the best didnt have thyme so used basil and it was perfect
5,i only used cup of flour the second time i made this it was delicious both times but we like the filling a bit thinner its definitely a new favorite in our house
5,this far exceeded my expectations which were already high because this site has never let me down it makes so much that i actually made three pies with it i added basil and mushrooms frozen pies are excellent for new parents i brought one to a couple recently and it was a huge hit definitely file this one away as a keeper
5,this recipe is superior to any others i have tried it has now become a regular home comfortfood for our large familyso delish we prefer just one crust on the top so i just put the filling into a casserole dishdishes and top with crust then bake
5,my entire family loved this even my picky year old i did not have corn which was a bummer but pie still full of veggies i used a large pyrex and used pizza dough rather than pie dough on top only delish also i always leave out thyme as i think it is too strong
5,easy and it was the best
5,deliscous will make again and again
5,absolutely delicious comfort food and well worth the time i added celery to the onion carrot saute and bay leaves to the cream sauce while it simmered but then removed them i used half for a crust pot pie and froze it it cooked up great weeks later the other half of the chicken mix i baked in a qt pirex baker uncovered st for min while i made homemade waffle batter reduced the sugar and typical spices adding a pinch of poultry spice instead my family went wild over the waffles topped with the bubbling and rich hot chicken veggie gravy a total hit and kept the pot pie weeks later seeming like a whole new dish winner winner chicken dinners
5,my go to pot pie recipe this is absolutely delicious i always make this for company and get rave reviews
5,best pot pie recipe i have ever found made this last night for sunday family dinner and everyone raved about it one pie fed adults and small children only changes i made to recipe were omitting the thyme picky kids and adding cup half and half in with milk delicious will make this again and again
5,i have made chicken and other pot pies for years this is by far my favorite base recipe i can never make a recipe without some augmentation to make it my own mishpachahlike family my bubbe would say i omitted the milk i used a cup of homemade milk free gravy i had left from the meal for which i made the roast chicken we were using leftovers for this pie i recently discovered if done right no milk is needed and creaminess survives i also added an extra cup of chicken broth to compensate for the fluid in addition i added a tbs of dried parsley and substituted diced yams for the white potatoes i made a homemade simple crust ice water butter flour and salt and brushed the top with yolkwater combo and sprinkled with a few pinches of dries thyme the cooking time was spot on even here at high elevation in colorado i only wish you could see the photos and taste the creamy hearty comforting goodness i froze the second pot pie filling on its own to be put in a fresh crust another time during this pandemic freezer space is at a premium my new go to pot pie recipe mazel tov to taste of home
5,having never made a chicken pot pie before in my life i was thrilled with how easy this recipe was to make and how delicious it turned out we halved the recipe to make just one pie the nice thing this was a forgiving recipe we had slightly less chicken then called for but slightly more potatoes and didnt have any onions because thats pandemic cooking so just used some onion powder for flavor really as long as you fill the pie and have the right amount of the gravy mix its okay to have some variation on the fillings and will still turn out great will absolutely make this again and again
5,i used a oz package of spinach and cheese refrigerated tortellini because that was all they had turned out awesome so much flavor
5,we loved it making it for the second time because my daughter begged us to make it again
5,i have been cooking for years and this is the best meatloaf i have ever found it is my husbands favorite allison columbiana ohio

5,this was so delicious i have made it several times question though could i brown the meat etc and then throw everything in a crockpot on low for hours so its ready when i get home thanks
5,the only change i made was using cooked until browned and caramelized hot italian sausage chopped i only added amount of tortellini we were having that night added fresh tortellini the second time its also freezer friendly without the tortellini so simple and so delicious
5,doubled the recipe but used a quart of chicken broth and a bit of extra water used a big package of baby spinach and packages of strongal fresco chicken sausage sweet italian style it was so good strong stronghad a nice rich flavor took it to my mils for dinner she made sure we left enough for meals i used an quart crockpot cooked it for about hours on low so very good having for dinner again tonight my husband wants me to make it againstrong
5,one of my goto meals and i have been making for many years always a sure fire hit can add more veggies or spices if youd like sometimes we use the hot spicy sausage gives it more of a kick great recipe
5,guys if you need a fast easy recipe with limited ingredients that you can switch out this is the one it comes out fast and great tasting i substitute swiss chard for spinach grew mountains of it threw in half a bag of frozen tortellini as the fresh only comes oz packages at my store adjust the red pepper flakes as your family likes keeping this one for that need a quick healthy dinner
5,what a delicious surprise this was easy to make and it was so tasty im not a huge fan of cooked spinach but this was very good this is definitely going in my file of favorite soups

5,this soup was very good i accidentally picked up italian diced stewed tomatoes but it still very good i will be making this many more times thanks so much for the recipe
5,we love this recipe even my very picky teenage sons gobbles it up i sub one package of frozen spinach oz package of frozen tortellini and use one pound of sweet italian sausage a great soup
5,used hot italian sausage and used all chicken broth no water comes together really quickly but has a lot of great flavor
5,this soup is amazing my husband and i loved the second time i made it i left out the tomatos and used shredded chicken instead of the sausage amp mozzarella and chicken tortellini instead of just cheese and it is now one of my top favorite meals
5,this soup is beyond amazing it is the best tortellini soup on the planet prepared exactly as written wow
5,simple and delicious i did use hot italian sausage and celery as well turned out great thank you
5,this is a great recipe we subbed kielbasa sliced thin for the turkey sausageadded two cans white navy beans rinsed and drained well low sodium chicken broth tasty and amazing recipe
5,funny thing i saw this recipe less than days after i saw another very similar recipe on another website and it wasnt what i was looking for at all so i took it as a sign that i should give it a try the other recipe didnt use any meat but it had carrots amp celery with the onion and it also used zucchini i mixed both ecipes
5,this is very yummy family loved it making it again but wanted to know if you can make ahead or will the tortellini get all mushy
5,i dont cook often so i like easy amp delicious recipes this one was super easy amp has tons of flavor i did use italian sausage instead amp added oz of cheese tortellini i will definitely be making this again so happy i tried it
5,this soup has so much flavorand we will be making this dish from now on i doubled my recipe and even leftovers were amazing
5,i love this soup a friend passed it to me and its so so good if i have frozen refrigerated tortellini should i cook first or thaw amp add thx submitting this comment for nd time because i forgot to click the stars
5,amy id suggest that you just add the frozen tortellini to the soup and let it simmer until the pasta is done it should only take a couple of minutes more than indicated for the refrigerated tortellini alone this has become my husbands favorite coolweather soup ive found that we always have leftovers with just the two of us and the tortellini tastes great in this soup but it absorbs a large amount of the broth after the first day and kind of takes over i discovered that replacing the tortellini with fresh gnocchi is a fabulous substitution and the gnocchi is much better behaved in the leftover soup
5,i made this a couple of months ago and my husband who is not a fan of soup mentioned it tonight and would like to have it again we did not have much leftover when i made it so it was definitely enjoyed by our children too
5,ive made this a couple of times very flavorful and filling i love this delicious soup
5,my husband said this recipe is a keeper i dont hear that very often from him great taste with a little zip to the broth will definitely make this again
5,awesome soup great flavor and very flexible for whats on hand house smelled like italian restaurant and everyone loved we like the kick red pepper flakes adds so we use about teaspoon as a volunteer field editor with taste of home magazine i love great tasting dishes that are easy to customize
5,oh my goodness this came out so good i did switch out the pepper flakes for cayenne since i didnt have the flakes so yummy unfortunately my kid didnt like the spinach eye roll cant please everyone
5,absolutely love this and so easy to make my grocery store only had hot turkey sausage so i opted instead for the precooked jimmie dean sausage crumbles the textures and flavors just go together so well
5,we make this almost weekly in our house we love to use it for lunches for the week i try to always have the ingredients on hand but the best thing about this recipe is that you can easily alter it and its still good we use wegmans chicken sausage in various flavors usually mild italian and sundried tomato and basil and if i dont have fresh garlic garlic powder works fine i also use frozen cut leaf spinach instead of fresh it always turns out great even when i double the recipe
5,great recipe that makes a delicious meal and will be on repeat this fall and winter easy skill level and quick per other reviews i used all chicken broth in place of water and added oz can great northern beans i had a oz package of tortellini and used it all the liquid was sufficient for that amount and it makes a heartier portion it is perfect as is but next time i am going to add a parmesan rind for extra rustic taste
5,absolutely love this it was also actually easy to make no hidden steps in between the other steps to prepare food for cooking used prechopped container of onion and preminced garlic to make this even faster with no chopping made exactly per recipe using sweet italian sausage no swapping out water for more chicken broth and it was perfect if i had made that swap as some readers did it would have been too potent for our taste recipe perfect as is
5,i love this its tasty and easy just right for a light meal
5,husband and i love this recipe easy to make
5,simple and quick and very tasty i would use regular chicken broth instead of reduced sodium it was good using the reduced sodium broth but just a little better after i added some salt
5,simple easy and fabulous flavor i made it per the recipe and wouldnt change a thing it was hearty and flavorful could not stop eating it shared with a friend will put this in the favorites book serving suggestion good warm crusty bread with roasted garlic and a glass of red wine
5,we love this soup i have made this plenty of times
5,wonderful soup very tasty
5,pure comfort food purely perfection i chose all fresh organic ingredients and used spicy chicken sausage i seved this soup with some warm buttered italian bread
5,excellent hearty and easy to make i added a dash of red peppers as directed and it was enough that i will be a bit lighter on my dash next time it doesnt take much to flavor the soup obviously that is a matter of taste definitely one i will make again
5,love this soup
5,i make this soup often serve it with rolls and a salad
5,this was great i used spicy italian sausage and sausage tortellini loved it
5,this is a great tasting and hearty soup with bursting flavor i like it with a rustic french bread my family loves it
5,a friend recommended this recipe made the soup for the first time my husband is asking for it again within a few days loved it
5,loved this i used spicy turkey sausage which was really good in this then just added some italian seasoning quick and easy too
5,i absolutely love this soup like many i made a couple of changes to the recipe i used plain ground pork in place of the sausage and often like to add some cubed butternut squash its greatedit i have no idea why i made two posts
5,i absolutely love this recipe it has fantastic flavor and its very appealing to look at two changes i made from the original recipe is to use plain ground pork over sausage and i add some cubed butternut squash also not bad if you happen to not have the tortellini because you ran out of the store without grabbing it to use some other type of pasta like farfalle
5,everyone in my family loves this soup even the kids who are picky eaters the first time i made this i only had ground turkey sausage on hand so i used that i also use all chicken broth instead of adding water
5,this is one of our family favorites
5,absolutely loved this my mom wouldnt eat it because of the pasta but too bad for her i made half the recipe since it was just myself to eat it had it for lunch for a few days too but that was okay i used hot pork sausage but i like things hot would definitely make again especially during a winter stormnummy
5,this was really really good i love soups and i do of all the cooking in the house my wife only realy will eat soups in the winter to me thats just crazy soups are awesome wife and both kids couldnt get enough with the kids both arguing about how to split the last bowls worth the changes and additions i made are for the proteins i used boneless chicken thighs diced and browned in pot chicken sausage links with sun dried tomatoes browned in skillet then sliced for the water i used more chicken broth i also added large carrots sliced and a mid to small zucchini halfed length ways and sliced i half the amount of garlic and added salted to taste prob about teaspoon and i added the sausage at the same time as the tortellini
5,this is my go to soup when asked to bring soup to a function its always a hit and im asked for the recipe the only change i made was to use a pound of italian sausage or hot italian depending on where its going thanks for sharing i love this soup
5,this soup was amazing i thought since it had limited ingredients and was a quick soup it would lack in flavor but that was not the case the only thing i did differently was use spicy bulk sausage this one is a keeper
5,my whole family loved this soup such delicious flavor i substituted a large can of tomato soup for the diced tomatoes and used ground sweet italian sausage in place of the turkey sausage i will definitely make this again for my family
5,i do not post many reviews but have taken toh magazine since it started an i am a big fan i did want to post this soup recipe because it is delicious when i make a recipe for the st time i usually follow it as i did this one with the exception of i used all broth an no water which was cans i could not find turkey links this time so i used johnsonville chicken garlic links an just sliced them up an browned them with the onion i thought this would taste bland without adding other seasonings but i was wrong it tasted great thank you tracy for this gem
5,i loved this soup soon as i tried it at a lunch i went to so i tried it at home and my husband absolutely loved it too its now my go to soup and i just change it up by using different meats such as johnsonville brats sliced then cooked or taken out of the casings amp cooked and i use chicken breasts too
5,i usually twerk a recipe to my own taste this was perfect as is it will be a staple recipe in our house thank you
5,one of our favorites just as is but being a tweaker i added a can of great northern beansyum
5,i made this soup last night and it was so amazing i am sharing it with everyone i know i made a few changes due to lack of reading the recipe fully i used pork italian sausage instead of turkey and let it brown really well i omitted both peppers red pepper because my little tongue doesnt do well with spice and black because i failed to see it when i read the recipe i used dried basil because my market was out of fresh other than that i made it exactly as the recipe reads even with the water which did not dilute the flavor at all i will make this over and over again i cannot express how good it was
5,on this icy cold michigan winter day this hot soup was awesome i used italian chicken sausage cut into chucks in addition to the actual recipe i added some fresh sliced mushrooms fresh sugar snap peas that were in the fridge and about a tablespoon of chicken soup base i posted a picture of my masterpiece online it looked fabulous i only wish some of my friends were closer so they could have tasted the yummyiness too
5,i made this recipe and everyone raved over it it was absolutely delicious everyone wanted recipe thats how you really know if they like it or are just being nice my daughter inlaw loved it and she hates soup i however went with the original version and used spicy italian sausage rather than turkey sausage or ground turkey but im sure they would also be fine
5,i made this for a dinner party and served it in sip n style bowls i ordered on amazonit was perfect
5,ive made this soup several times it is amazing so much flavor i only make one change i use hot italian sausage
5,fantastic recipe i made it and the family loved it its a regular on the menu now
5,ive made this soup several times as well but with hot italian sausage great flavor and so easy to make it is amazing definitely a keeper
5,this is a fullbodied soup that makes a great meal with a side of crusty bread i used the hot italian turkey sausage because we like spicy food there was mild not overpowering heat the preparation was quick and easy the result is a delicious homemade soup
5,i used hot italian sausage and added half a cup of heavy cream at the end and it was fantastic got rave reviews from my family
5,super quick easy and delicious i will definitely make this again even my picky year old liked it
5,this is definitely a family favorite ive been making it for over a year but i too have made a few minor changes to it i use a onepound package of regular pork sausage instead of the turkey sausage links then to make up for the lack of italian flavor i added teaspoon of italian seasoning and to save time i also threw in a few handfuls of frozen spinach instead of dealing with fresh spinach like most soups it gets even better after it sits overnightassuming that it lasts that long
5,i too made my own adjustments i had cooked chicken breast in crock then used frozen spinach so darn good amp easy
5,family favourite i use c prepared chicken broth in place of the canned broth and water and spicy italian sausage or links removed from casing and crumbled
5,easy and filling served with garliccheese sticks only change i made was to use turkey meat balls will definitely make again
5,very good
5,my husband said this is his new favorite i used two oz cartons of chicken broth and omitted the water johnsonville mild italian sausage frozen spinach thawed and squeezed dry and diced tomatoes with italian seasonings really nice flavor thanks for sharing a great recipe
5,delish substitutions made used sweet italian sausage fresh chicken stock chopped tomatoes wbasil sweet italian sausage tortellini creole seasoning instead of pepper added spice and flavor
5,i scrolled past this recipe on the toh site and saw all the great reviews decided to try and wow wonderful flavor easy to throw together and a satisfying meal we used a hot turkey sausage and loved the kick i can see this being a regular recipe in our fallwinter lineup
5,loved it used hot italian sausage
5,i love this soup i cook the tortellini before adding it to the soup at the end
5,a favorite for sure made it times so far used tomatoes out of my garden but otherwise followed the recipe delicious
5,perfect there is a reason so many people have given this recipe stars
5,fantastic satisfying weeknight meal i made it vegetarian using vegetable broth and tofurkey sun dried tomato and basil italian sausage delicious
5,great for the holidays
5,husband and i loved this i used johnsonville hotn spicy bratwurst oz forgot the water and chose not to use the parmesan cheese it was absolutely delicious and filling with just the right amount of kickkeeps you coming back for more
5,made a huge pot of this soup for christmas bunco with the girls at someones suggestion i cooked it a day ahead to let the flavors blend overnight i used italian sausage like hamburger from the meat department i too omitted the water and added extra chicken broth im not fan of spinach so i used escarole lettuce instead it turned bright green and with the italian tomatoes i used the soup had colors of red and green and really looked festive oh and i used whole wheat tortellini i served it with the onion swiss cheese bread ring and that heavenly marinated olive and cheese ring everyone raved about the meal we had christmas cookies for dessert
5,i loved this soup great flavor combination and only gets better the next day the addition of sausage makes it a hearty meal all by itself grate some fresh parmesan over the top and it is heaven would definitely make this one again
5,super easy and delicious my daughter keep asking me to make this one again d
5,this is wonderful made a few changes based solely on family preferences halved the garlic used all chicken broth and t dried basil then very low simmer covered for minutes my family likes tri color penne so actually boiled that separately and set up a soup bar where you could assemble this any way you like pasta spinach ladle soup over cheese a huge keeper thank you
5,love this recipe i did make a couple changes i added carrots when cooking the onions and i used canned tomatoes seasoned with garlic and onion included the juices i also included a bag of frozen green beans before adding the spinach and tortellini my husband does not care for soups generally however he loves this soup definitely a keeper
5,i sauteed shredded kale with no stems with the onion and added carrots add garlic after i generally find adding garlic and other potentially harsher arromatics later so they dont burn is the right call i then added a teaspoon of sweet paprika a bay leaf and two thyme sprigs right before the broth and tomatoes replace water with all broth turned out fantastic for the finer palate a cup of gruyere added really is awesome in lieu of parmesan should note i doubled the recipe as well so all measures reflect that dankness
5,starslove the flavor i used garlic with olive oil diced tomatoes and chicken stock instead of water
5,this soup was awesome great flavor and it took me minutes to make and tasted like it simmered for three hours i used only cup of water more chicken broth used diced tomatoes with oregano and onion and fatfreereduced sodium chicken broth to reduce the calories further i also had frozen tortellini so i used those as i think they hold up better than fresh
5,my family loved this
5,this was fabulous
5,excellent i like to use kale instead of spinach sometimes
5,one of our favorite soups so good
5,this is so easy and tasty actually better the next day
5,we love this soup very filling and delicious
5,very goodbut forget the turkey sausage and use real pork i also add a little more tortellini just my preferenceand i used stewed tomatoes in place of dicedother than that excellent
5,outstanding flavour my whole family loved this soup they told me its a keeper which in my family means it becomes part of our regular rotation of meals
5,i made this soup yesterday and loved it it was really quick and easy to make i am sitting at work wishing i would have brought some for lunch
5,outstanding need i say more
5,hot italian sausage is the way go and the soup pot was empty a definate keeper
5,no wonder this recipe is a contest winner it was delicious very flavorful and hearty i used a total of two oz swanson chicken broth boxes because i thought it needed more broth to match the tortellini and because of other reviewers saying the same thing i was glad i did i did not use the water because of what other reviewers said about replacing it with broth which my bigger boxes of broth took care of i skipped the can of diced tomatoes because im not a fan but i can see how they would add to the soup for others the recipe calls for turkey sausage but i used regular italian sausage and it calls for oz but i had oz so i used the whole thing for the refrigerated tortellini i used the tiny cheese raviolettis that buitoni offers i used fresh spinach from one of the oz salad bags probably used about oz of it and didnt chop it up and i did two tablespoons of the fresh basil because i love it i used more than a dash of red pepper did a couple of shakes we did put shredded parmesan on top and i highly recommend i served the soup with really good five grain bread and butter and as i write this i wish i was having the meal again tonight because it was amazing
5,absolutely delicious the parmesan cheese added while the soup is served adds to the flavor the only change i made was to add more chicken broth cups of broth and omitted the water since the tortellini absorbs some of the liquid not enough liquid is left for leftovers if more broth is not added at the start
5,this is a family favorite i use spicy regular italian sausage
5,yum will make again
5,this is the most excellent soup that you can make it is quick and easy our family loves it
5,i made a few changes to this soup to accommodate what i had on hand it was super easy and delicious im not a fan of sausage so i omitted that i added sweet peppers to the onion and used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth i also didnt have fresh spinach so i thawed some frozen spinach squeezed it and crumbled that in i would definitely make this again the red pepper flakes gave it a hint of spice and the parmesan cheese on top was a nice finishing touch
5,this was very easy to make if you like it soupier add a little more broth i made everything as is and the family wants me to cook it again
5,my husband loves this soup i add more broth so that it is not so thick
5,made with meat tortelli nd time and was very good as well instead of sausage
5,easy amp yummy my husband loves this soup ive changed it up on occasion by substituting fresh green beans for spinach or add both use precooked thawed italian meatballs cut into quarters or roasted cherry tomatoes to add
5,loved it
5,best soup ive ever had
5,this soup was amazing even if you are not into this type of soup it is a must try i used red onion spicy sausage instead of the turkey sausage chicken broth instead of water added extra and a carton of fresh cherub cherry tomatoes instead of a can of diced tomatoes enjoy
5,this recipe is a keeper i highly recommend this best i have made and will keep this recipe when making in the future i read other reviews and agree the base sauce is excellent so easy to make with simple ingredients i made the chicken in a slow cooker and cooked with vegetable stock for flavor when done i shredded taste was great i did the potatoes but left out the corn and peas as i dont have i added celery when cooking the onions for a bit of texture instead of pie crust i made buttermilk biscuits and put on the top using a small roasting pan allowed to have biscuits for all and it covers the pan nicely try this you will like it and so will the family
5,best chicken pot pie recipe i have found my family loves it
5,i love this recipe i first came upon it years ago when i was making freezer meals in preparation for our second daughter on the way and wanted to have meals ready in the freezer ive made it over and over ever since it is the ultimate comfort food and i love that it makes pies
5,this is a perfect recipe i was glad it made pies i was making one for a friend and another to keep we had ours last night and it was exactly what i hoped it would be ultimate comfort food our very picky year old loved it he asked for seconds i swapped the dried thyme out for tablespoon of fresh thyme because i love using fresh herbs i boiled my potatoescarrots in chicken broth then used the same broth to boil the cubes chicken meat breast and used the same broth for the gravy i imagine using a rotisserie chicken would make this even easier i also did a light egg wash on the crust for color i will be saving this recipe as my new goto for pot pie
5,i make a lot of recipes off the internet and i usually dont post reviews but im sitting here eating some chicken pot pie and im wondering why in the cussword ive never made this before this is absolutely delicious and i think if i didnt have more self control id eat the whole thing right now make this pie if you dont like thyme then reduce its got a lot of thyme but its fantastic
5,this was delicious i added garlic because i love garlic but it was so wonderful the base sauce was so creamy i used low fat milk but was still deliciousness i also added better then chicken bouillon in with the chicken stock step for more flavor
5,delicious nice blend of chicken and vegetables a keeper for sure
5,i love this recipe i make a vegetarian dairy free version of this pot pie times a year i sub the dairy for almond milk and vegan butter then use more veggies and vegetable broth instead of chicken always a crowd favourite even meat eaters and kids
5,delicious even the picky eaters gobbled it down
5,delicious i added seasoned salt poppyseeds a bay leaf and diced celery
5,i have been making this recipe for years it has become a family favorite i usually make little individual pies to freeze with the extra filling it is my go to to bring to friends after surgery or tragic loss
5,this was sooo good will make it again
5,delicious i will definitely make it again
5,delicious i made a few adjustments i substituted whole milk with oat milk i used pearl onions instead of chopped onion i added onion powder and garlic powder to the seasonings i added broccoli when boiling potatoes and carrots i added mushrooms when adding peas and corn i seasoned my chicken when cooking it with same seasoning as i put in this pie i half baked the bottom pastry before adding filling and top layer of pastry to ensure it wasnt under cooked i use a square glass baking dish rubbed with a generous coating of butter i would love to try it with turkey breast
5,very filling soup great for a cold winter night i used all chicken stock and eliminated the water also added chopped celery and carrots i made mine in the crockpot and let it simmer while at work just cooked the tortellini and added it and the basil and spinach before serving it tastes great the next day
5,love love loved it did i mention that i loved it i had been looking for a soup that wasnt so full of salt healthy yet delicious this was wonderful tasty hearty and very fulfilling the only thing i did differently was add stewed tomatoes instead of diced i like the chunky tomatoes plus it adds more veggies to your meal its cold here now so i am excited to get off and head to the grocery store so that i can make a pot tonight yummy ps if you sprinkle a little parmesan shredded cheese on top its gives it an even better flavor
5,a really awesome soup i love how i can get different flavors from every spoonful i made it with regular sausage because i couldnt find turkey sausage nor did i care for it that much came out wonderful but i was a little spicy
5,fabulous i have meateaters in the family so i cooked the hot italian turkey sausage with a pound of ground turkey when i make this again ill add some bitesized chicken to the turkey as well i used crushed italian tomatoes instead of the diced variety next time i will also add the tortellini to each bowl because the leftovers soaked up too much of the liquid you gotta try this recipe
5,absolutely fabulous this has been in my recipe box for some time finally got to try it tonight it was enjoyed by all thanks so much for sharing this fabulous recipe
5,delicious used sweet basil sausage amp italian seasoned tomatoes
5,this recipe has become one of my family favorites it makes a great meatless monday dinner i just omit the sausage and add a package of cream cheese cut into cubes minutes before serving allow the cream cheese to melt and stir into the soup for added richness
5,this is one of my favorite soups now used fresh tomatoes and spinach from farmers market when making it the first time and it was delicious tastes just as good maybe better second day
5,this was good i substituted what i had on hand used a box of frozen spinach and substituted oz of a bagged tortellini used a roasted diced tomato which had some additional seasoning my picky son liked it so id say it was a hit

5,great recipe i followed it exactly and my family said they would like it often
5,amazing one of the best soups ive ever made
5,i made this soup substituting vegetarian sausage for the italian sausage and vegetable broth for the chicken broth and the vegetarians and meat lovers at my house all loved it
5,this recipe is truly excellent but i suggest a couple alterations for finicky eaters i used crushed tomatoes instead of diced tomatoes it gives the broth a wonderful red color plus you get the flavor of tomatoes without the texture second i add about medium petitley diced carrots and saute them with the onions and sausage you get an extra veggie serving in there and it adds a pop of color almost too pretty to eat its a real hit with everyone ive started tripling the recipe and freezing it so i always have some on hand
5,everyone loved loved loved this definitely a keeper
5,love it i made two pots of soup using this recipe yesterday for a family dinner one pot was exactly as written and it was wonderful will definitely make again and again the other pot of soup was for vegetarians so it was meatless i used vegetable broth in place of the chicken broth and for variety butternut squash ravioli in place of the tortellini what was leftover went for lunch today so it was very good also

5,i have made this soup several times and we enjoy it more each time i use bulk italian sausage instead which saves time it is so easy to make and perfect on a cold night with crusty italian bread i also add mushrooms and red and green peppers on top of everything it already calls for and its always amazing
5,this is the only soup my entire family including kids age amp loves i use a pound of ground turkey sausage and season it with a mixture i found at i also use all chicken broth no water and i double the tortellini very filling easy and delicious
5,really enjoyed this soup quick and easy to make too i used spicy sausages to give it some extra spice

5,this soup was delicious just as written i did not make any changes it had great flavor our whole family liked
5,i made this soup for dinner tonight and it is awesome i subbed kale for the spinach personal taste with delicious results definitely recommend this recipe to others
5,i make this soup at least once a month my family loves it i have shared this with my recipe club at work and everybody who has made it loves it
5,wonderful recipe the whole family loved it
5,my whole family loved this fantastic flavor
5,this is my husbands favorite soup
5,this is the best soup for the italian sausage i use one half johnsonville italian hot and one half johnsonville italian sweet its a nice blend and gives the soup a little bite i also add sliced fresh mushrooms took it to a soup and sandwich at church and received several requests for the recipe heidi launer alamogordo nm
5,made this for guinea pig guests excellent easy and quick this is going in the permanent file
5,i actually prepared this recipe with a ounce can of rotel diced tomatoes amp green chilies a oz carton of beef broth and a oz bag of frozen cheese totellinidefrosted i added a dash of tabasco instead of the red pepper flakes and used the sweet turkey links as well i am one of those cooks who believes in improvising with ingredients on hand and recipes always seems turned out well for me be creative
5,everyone enjoyed the soup along with slices of garlic bread i used lb of ground italian pork sausage instead of links otherwise i followed the recipe as is very very good
5,i love this recipe i have used ground beef or regular italian sausage
5,this soup is fantastic major raves reviews and seconds by all made this pot disappear quickly
5,i make this all the time light healthy and delicious
5,awesome we used regular italian sausage links rather than the italian turkey sausage links suggested also i kept the casings on the sausage much easier
5,added left over chicken cilantro celery and sundried tomatoes delicious no one knew they were eating leftovers i kept the sausages also but used chickenapple sausages
5,my mom gave me this recipe a few years ago she used zucchini instead of spinach ive used either one or green beans delcious
5,i made this recipe as written and it was delicious my husband loved it too and it will definitely be a repeat in my house
5,awesome i made this for the first time when i got my magazine in the mailand make it probably once a month through the fall and winter everyone that tastes it raves simple and very delicious
5,great flavor and easy to make i didnt have any italian sausage so i used country sausage and added italian seasoning and some fennel otherwise i pretty much made it as written and served it with small sandwiches great meal for the fall
5,i have now made this yummy soup several times my family and coworkers all agree its a keeper
5,this was so good and healthy and easy it was a little spicy so i left out the papper amp red pepper and used a little less turkey italian sausage the flavor was intense and the parmesan was a nice added touch i will surely make this again
5,the flavor of this is incredible for such few and simple ingredients i will make this many times i used fresh basil and my local grocery only had sweet italian turkey so i was sure to give it a few shakes of red pepper flakes the only thing i changed was i omitted the water we like ours a little thicker and i like to avoid the carbs in the crackers that i typically use for that purpose two thumbs up oh and my eight yr old ate bowls so your kids will like it too
5,this soup is a snap to make and it received heaps of praise from my motherinlaw when i made it for her the soup is full of scrumptious flavors with just the right amount of heat
5,this soup is very delicious and very low fat and low calorie
5,this is one of the best soup recipes i have simple to make and packed full of flavor
5,this recipe was so quick to fix and really delicious my family said its a keeper
5,this is a great soup to impress it is very easy and so delicious great with a side of crusty bread be sure to just barely cook the tortellini as they can overcook very quickly
5,such a easy quick delicious soup didnt have any tortellini so i used cheese ravioli my husband loved it
5,very good soup not a huge sausage fan tastes best the first day more sausagey aroma after flavors meld
5,this has become a family favorite easy quick and delicious
5,everytime i make this recipe for friends and coworkers i am asked for the recipe this recipe rates gold stars
5,tasted delicious looked beautiful and was easy to make the perfect recipe
5,everyone ate it and that is a big deal in my house usually half will like half wont children adults didnt have tortellini or ravioli so made due with rotini pasta also omitted red pepper flakes cuz of the kids doubled the recipe of course and served with shredded mozarella didnt have parm added garlic bread and viola yummy for all
5,loved the soup i will cut back on the water next time just for more flavor i added sliced fresh mushrooms to mine i may try to add pasta next time instead of the tortellini jut to see how it taste
5,my husband and i loved this very much though i admit to making a few changes to suit our tastesi doubled the recipe for a bigger batch and used links of johnsonville spicy italian pork sausage my man likes meat instead of turkey sausage links i sliced the sausage into pieces and added the garlic with the onions and meat from the start instead of waiting i added the dried basil black pepper and red pepper flakes when i added the broth and tomatoes i did not add any water so it would cook longer in the soup and pull more flavors out i used more seasoning than recipe called for and used heaping tsps of dried basil tsp of black pepper and added tsp red pepper to suit our need for heati also added tbs of chicken bouillon and heaping tsp of onion powder because we like our flavors stronger and the tomatoes were a bit too dominant the rest i just followed the recipe and voila going to make this over and over again
5,i forgot to mention that i used oz cans of hunts diced tomatoes for my double batch
5,this recipe was enjoyed even by my picky hubby i added a can of cannellini beans rinsed and drained and it was terrific
5,amazing flavor for a quick soup
5,i didnt change anything except that i buy bulk italian sausage its cheaper than links and it has become my familys absolutely favorite soup i love it because i can make it after work and know it will be a hit ive also brought it to friends who need a meal great recipe
5,wow so easy so flavorful its on my list to repeat soonomitted the pepper flakes and used hot italian sausage instead like a couple of other posters did
5,this is one of our favorite soups my husband and i fight over the leftovers and the kids love the tortellini and they even eat some of the spinachi love that it is good for us too
5,i used some bulk pork sausage that i had on hand but i think i will try it with some bulk turkey italian seasoned sausage to get the benefit of the lower calories we really enjoyed the soup and yes ill make it again i served it with my home made artisan bread with rosemary seasoning yum
5,i made this last night and doubled the recipe hoping to have leftovers no such luck my family loved this soup and said its a keeper
5,my husband and i both agree this was delicious next time i will make a double batch so i can share it with family thank you mmb
5,this is the first time ive written a reviewbut it is also the first time ive felt compelled to this is very tasty for the amount of time and effort that is put into making the recipe very easy to makei dont even like spinachbut this soup is soooo goodi used sausage mince in place of the italian turkey sausage links as this is what i had on handthis was excellent and i will definitely be making this again well done
5,this recipe is so simple and absolutely deliciouos my family loved it i will definitely be adding it to my regular recipe rotation
5,i love this recipe to add a little flair to it by adding oz of fat free cream cheese and a cap full of mrs dash hot seasoning
5,this soup is delicious i will definitely make it again i used loose hot italian sausage that was surprisingly lean because my husband loves spicy food and i left out the pepper flakes next time i will try it with a different sausage just for a change but this recipe is a keeper
5,i made different soups for super bowl and this was the favority by far husband said it was the best soup he ever had
5,absolutely fabulous i used hot turkey sausage i loved the pep this soup had
5,this is a wonderfully easy tasty amp healthy dessert my only comment is that the amount of gelatin is incorrect since it says one packet i used the smallest size which is oz not oz just a typo when it was posted im sure i used the full oz packet and it came out fine
5,this has been a favorite in my household i use oz amp bars of cream cheese instead of the yogurt not a fan and use an additional oz of cool whip on top i use various jello flavors it is especially good with strawberry jello and cup frozen sliced strawberries mixed in the filling i also use the larger oz graham cracker crust to fit it all in love how easy this is i always get compliments when serving to others they cant believe how easy it is to make
5,yummy and light i have been making various flavors with this recipe for years we used to go camping and i would take the ingredients then make this to share with our campground friends and it was always a hit
5,whoopsi forgot to rate the recipe
5,omg this is so good one of the best key lime pies ive ever made super easy only took minutes and so versatile you could use numerous jello and yogurt flavors
5,excellent light key lime pie easy and quick to make want to try other flavors such as raspberry which someone suggested maybe with a chocolate crumb crust and arranging some fresh raspberries on top
5,this was very good both my daughter and husband loved it i did use regular lime gelatin because i couldnt find sugar free and i used regular whipped topping very easy to make
5,this is a very good and easy pie i have also substituted strawberry jello and yogurt and some sliced fresh strawberries for another yummy pie
5,while this isnt a traditional key lime pie its still a good pie if you are looking for something light and slightly sweet this is it ive also varied the flavors and made peach and strawberry really good and always gobbled up
5,i have made this with no changes many times and it never lasts long i also use this recipe but use strawberry jello strawberry yogurt and if i have them on hand fresh strawberries sliced both are great for those warm summer days
5,what a great recipe i made one with lime one with strawberry and an orange one for a picnic your recipe is fantastic and so very versatile
5,i have made this pie multiple times in the past we loved it so easy and light also
5,thus pie is so yummy
5,pgreat recipei used pork italian sausagefrozen spinach and frozen tortellini because that is what i had on hand and it worked just as welli definitely will keep making thisp
5,was craving comfort food and this was everything i hoped for easy to follow instructions was a big hit with my husband
5,great recipe i made some adjustments for our family i added teaspoons of garlic powder i also increased the seasonings to reflect the following dried thyme to teaspoons teaspoons of pepper and teaspoons of salt i also swapped the milk for half and half it was perfect that way for our families tastebuds
5,loved this pie i made half a recipe more or less in a pie plate with my favorite crust recipe i didnt have thyme so i used poultry seasoning the corn was canned because thats what i had and the carrots were leftover roasted no peas since hubs really cant stand them so i threw in some leftover green beans instead and i used a combination of skim milk and halfamphalf because again its what i had pandemic baking as another reviewer noted but it was creamy and delicious and next time i will make extra and freeze yum
5,absolutely the best chicken pot pie recipe i made a few minor adjustments based on ingredients i had at home throwing out my old recipe this is the cats meow
5,this is a family favorite ive made it multiple times and its a hit every time its easy to make which is my favorite kind of recipe because i really dont like to cook lol with ease in mind i typically use frozen mixed veggies and frozen onions if i dont have potatoes at hand i increase the chicken and veggies to make up the volume i will cook one and freeze the other for another day great recipe
5,wonderful recipe we found out that we do not like thyme so my daughter uses rosemary instead such a delicious perfect recipe she also makes her own pie crust which makes it even better she makes the portions because otherwise its too much for just pie unless is a bigger deeper pie dish
5,i actually made this for my son amp daughterinlaw who just had a new baby so was making some easy meals for them i made an extra for us it was so quick amp easy to make i thought that it was delicious amp probably the best chicken pot pie that ive ever had my husband said i dont know what you did but it was better than any other ive ever eaten i will definitely make this again amp freeze a few as well
5,added red and green bell pepper and broccoli florets and extra chicken broth to the gravy cut the recipe in half and still got two inch pies very good and im freezing one of the pies for use as another easy dinner
5,this was so good its quite time consuming but well worth it this recipe makes way to much for just my husband and i so i just made one nine inch pie with my own pie crust and will freeze the rest of the filling in food saver bags i am going to put filling over noodles next time hope it stands up to the freezer for a couple weeks
5,this was the best chicken pot pie ive ever made and is so much better than the store bought ones its classic and perfectly creamymy boyfriend rates every recipe i try and this one he gave and i agree i made some minor edjustments i used the cups of chicken stock to boil the carrots and potatoes and reserved the liquid to add back in later i only added cup of flour instead of cup and i added stalks of chopped celery when i added the onion to the pan i made pie last nightand froze the filling for a future pie i can truly say i will never buy a store bought chicken pie again
5,made it yesterday very tasty excellent recipe
5,this recipe was exactly what i was looking forrich thick gravy and delicious i dont care for pie crust so i used one puff pastry and cut the recipe in half now i wish i had made the whole thing as it was so good i omitted the corn but added celery everything else i include i used canned chicken and used the broth from the cans for the gravy i used a smaller rectangle dish than a x it was x so good i froze the leftovers and even took a serving over to my neighbor who lives alone she liked it too
5,awesome followed the directions to the letter and was very satisfied with the end product thanks for sharing this recipe
5,i add canned diced potatoes to mine so good everyone that has tried it is obsessed
5,my mother in law made this for my husband and i to save for when i had my son a quick meal to heat up since then i have made this x this is a great recipe the only thing i changed based on personal preference i added cloves of garlic and fresh thyme and rosemary from my garden i also only used stick of butter great recipe will continue to make
5,i made this for thanksgiving dinner for two we had already had turkey with the family the week before so we were looking for an alternative meal we loved it i only needed one pot pie for the two of us and dont have freezer room for a whole pie so i put the extra filling in a freezer bag for future use
5,easy and quick
5,ive been making this one for years hard to believe its so easy and yet so delicious i use sugar free gelatin and light whipped topping ive also made it with lemon gelatin and lemon yogurt sometimes i make it in an x square pan using just some graham cracker crumbs on the bottom instead of a crust to cut down on carbs that way i get servings instead of
5,great recipe i have made this pie twice the first time i made as key lime and the second time i used strawberry gelatin and strawberry yogurt and they were both delicious our guests really enjoyed these pies i am thinking of trying orange next so quick and easy
5,i added juice from of a large lime at the end and folded that in as well best key lime pie ever
5,this pie is super easy you can also change up the flavor just by changing the yogurt
5,love this easy flavorful summer recipe if you are a key lime pie snob its obvious from the ingredients that it is not going to be true key lime pie however call it creamy lime flavored pie either way mine came out delicious and it is great to serve on a warm summer evening i used chabani key lime flavored yogurt just because i love the flavor of this yogurt by itself stick it in the freezer for about an hour before serving and its like eating an ice cream pie yummy
5,love this pie it tastes great and only takes minutes to make sometimes i just make the filling and sprinkle crushed graham crackers over it
5,i am diabetic and love this pie i also make it with sugar free orange jello and orange yougart makes a wonderful orange cream pie
5,this is a delicious pie i was first introduced to it at a weight watcher meeting its a treat for those avoiding sugar
5,this recipe is for me i followed the directions to the letter and it was fabulous i made a low cholesterol graham cracker crust without butter to go with it we put one of the pies in the freezer and it was a lovely frozen desert
5,this is an easy wonderful light dessert i have made key lime raspberry and strawberry so far and plan to try more different flavors i used regular gelatin and lowfat greek yogurt and light whipped topping i didnt add all the whipped topping to the pie so i could put it on the pie along with fresh fruit when i served it delicious
5,this dessert was a fluffy little piece of lime heaven i used regular jello and whipped topping as some other reviewers did this would be a perfect dessert for a summer gathering it just tastes like summer and is so easy
5,well this was a big hit with hubby and i made it just as the recipe was printed would definitely make it again and again
5,i made this pie today and give it a huge thumbs up my husband and i both loved this pie so easy with only ingredients it makes a great last minute dessert i highly recommend this pie as a field editor for taste of home
5,ive made this pie twice so easy to make and they came out flawless and scrumptious my husband loves the recipe and so do ithis is a definite keeper and our families will be enjoying it in the future i followed the recipe but also added a little lime juice to increase the tang factor
5,very nice and very easy can also be modified using different flavors of jello amp yogurt
5,yummy i made two pies so simply and so good im giving the other one to my sister in law for her family for easter thank you leeann treacher
5,this recipe is so quick easy amp goodi have tried many flavor variationsraspberry yogurt amp raspberry jellostrawberry yogurt amp strawberry jelloif you garnish it with fresh berries once it sets it looks really fancybut it is so quick amp easy to makeit tasted great in every flavor very light amp fluffy yum oin the future i am going to try coconut yogurt amp pineapple jello pina colada pie
5,ive made this many times with different flavors of jello and yogurt even mixing and matching like orange jello and lemon yogurt no one even knows its made with sugar free or reduced fatsugar products if you want to reduce the sugar there are low sugar yogurts out there even without aspartamethe one thing i never done yet is put it in a pie crust i never saw the appeal of it in a pie the filling is great as its own thing a fluffy cool and flavorful dessert
5,so easy and delicious
5,you do not have to use the same flavor jello as the yogurt i really like raspberry yogurt with peach jello for example i usually use an oreo crust with most of my pies just because i like the look and taste and i always add plenty of fruit most of the time i will also use a juice or flavored iced tea in place of the water but that does bring up the sugar count love these pies
5,quick and easy
5,follow recipe as written soooo good quick and easy mjanderson
5,my husband just yelled out good pie guess that means i can make it again will try it in a different flavor maybe orange in a chocolate graham cracker crust hmm that sounds good this is so quick and easy to prepare
5,excellent i made this using regular ingredients no sugarfree or fatfree and both hubby and i loved this pie so easy and a great summer recipe next time i plan on using an oreo cookie crust i also plan on trying a lemon version of this pie
5,i made this for a gettogether along with a couple of other pies it was a hit everyone loved it its perfect for a light ending to a big meal
5,fyi use caution when you serve this to those who want sugarfree this recipe isnt check all your ingredients labels first before you serve this as sugar free if you used the yoplait yogurt as i did there are g of sugar per serving plus the graham cracker crust might have some mine will be for our dinner dessert tonight

5,absolutely delicious it was so easy to make and turned out just perfect definitely will make this over and over
5,my husbandwho doesnt usually like lowfat foodsloves this pie i love it because its delicious and super easy to make
5,yum this pie reminds me of my childhood and eating ambrosia salad i know our family and friends will enjoy it this year at thanksgiving i used a pillsbury pie crust in place of the graham cracker crust thanks for sharing
5,very light and fluffy next time i am going to add cream cheese
5,ive made this for my diabetic husband and sons and everyone loves it i make it with low fat and sugar free ingredients no one at our church pitchin knew it was diet and lowfat
5,wonderful i did make my own crust and used i the sugar and tsp stevia sweetener yogurt i used plain greek yogurt and put in tsp vanilla stevia to taste and squeezed a fresh lime into it it is to die for i am making it a regular summer treat oh who am i kidding year round treat
5,i recently came across this recipe and i am so glad i did this key lime pie is absolutely delicious and refreshing i have made it times each time changing it up a little for example even though i use the ingredients it calls for the first time i used containers of light yogurt w some fresh lime juice the second time i used light yogurt and regular yogurt and this third time i used light and regular yogurt and again added fresh squeezed lime juice i tasted it before pouring it into the crust and it was delicious third times a charm its just now setting in the refrigerator but i think from now on i will be adding lime juice bc it enhances the flavors and makes it a bit more tangy yum
5,easy quick and yummy my favorite kind of recipe
5,ive been making this for a long time and with various flavours always goes down a treat
5,will surely make this one
5,great recipe easier on glucose readings and delicious thanks for sharing with us i dont care if it is green but for those who do dont make it this so called sad imitation as amateur cook called it is better than most key lime pies i have eaten in some of the finest restaurants that not so amateur pastry chefs made
5,lighten up people so its not the real thing its still good
5,the key lime pie i have ever had was greenlimes are not yellow i have been making my grandmothers key lime pie for yrs and love the green look and taste this one looks yummyam going to try
5,read the ingredients key lime yogurts enough said
5,first of all it is called key lime pie because it is using key lime flavored yogurt secondly you can make this pie with cherry jello and cherry yogurt or strawberry jello and strawberry yogurt or whatever compatible flavors you like it is a delicious light pie that everyone seems to enjoy whenever it is served
5,i have been making for years im diabetic and this is one of my go to desserts when i want something light super easy to make
5,its a wonderful pie if you dont want to make it and miss out on a delicious light dessert simply because it doesnt use actual key limes then dont make it but if you do youre in for a real treat by the way the color doesnt affect the taste
5,good recipe
5,this was the best pot pie that i have ever eaten i halved the recipe so that i made one pie just for my husband and me it is one that i will make again and will share with others how good it was i moved it to a lower rack the last minutes to make sure the bottom crust was well done again one of the best ever chopped half a large onion i peeleddiced and boiled potatoes used cup frozen corn and cup peas and cup canned carrots drained the ones that needed to have liquid removed boiled ck breast and shredded them the sauce was half of the regular as given and had great flavor and thickened well had a little extra filling left over so i made a very small one with just crust on top yummy i see that another reviewer said they made the full recipe and froze half of the filling for another time good idea also
5,love this recipe i left out the corn and only used a top crust wonderful recipe for a quick dinner since i quite often boil chicken dice and freeze it and the broth
5,great recipe and an easy one whenever i have left over roasted chicken i make this dish i dice the carrots instead of slice and dont add the corn other than that follow recipe exactly perfect consistency to the sauce
5,this was the best pot pie ive ever made i halved the recipe used frozen mixed vegetables my only change will be to cube the chicken into bigger pieces next time
5,great recipe i followed all the directions but i smoked a whole chicken on my yoder stick burner smoker that added a wonderful smoky savory flavor especially after putting an herby rib on it ill definitely do it again
5,my neighbor brought this over after i got out of the hospital tues night i bugged her for the recipe right away i dont know what about this recipe that makes it so great but it is the best pot pie i ever tasted it must be the thyme butter and chicken broth really fantastic and will be baking it for myself after my hip heals
5,excellent recipe i altered the veggies that i used but followed the rest of the recipe the creamy roux in this thing is on point so delicious i make one pie using the creamy mixture and then freeze the creamy mixture for a future pie its perfect love it
5,this is how mom used to make pot pie always great
5,excellent i dont usually use recipes when i cook but this is a keeper will definitely make again
5,i halved this recipe to make one perfect pie i used chicken stock to cook my chicken breasts then reused to cook carrots and potatoes used milk and light butter very delicious
5,i made this potpie today and loved it i put have of the filling in a freezer bag for the next time i have a taste for chicken potpie this is a keeper
5,this is so good even my husband loved it amp he usually does not like chicken dishes love that you can cook pies amp freeze one for later amp the reheated frozen pie tastes just as delicious as the freshly made pie
5,weve made this recipe at least times and my family loves it its hearty and has incredible flavor weve used all dark meat chicken or a mix of white and dark and both are great its foolproof
5,this was amazing delicious great for a cold winters day highly recommend i used little purple potatoes which gave it a little more color
5,ive never made a chicken pot pie before and i am so glad i chose this recipe yum i roasted a whole chicken in the morning and diced it up which i will definitely do again for this such good flavor i froze one of the pot pies cant wait to see how it turns out
5,this is delicious quick easy and fun to make my grandsons and i have made it several times this summer we also decided to expand the idea we have since made orange pie using orange yogurt and orange jello and lemon pie the same way next week we are going to try cherry we think there is a lot a variety possible with these ingredients
5,this was so great on a hot day i did not put in a crust but in dessert cups i have also made it in peach and i plan on making lemon and raspberry as long as the jello and yogurt match you can make any flavor we love it
5,i made this pie for my kids amp they really liked it
5,so easy delicious and light love it
5,very good recipe my husband is a diabetic and he loves it
5,i do not like lime flavor typically i love this recipe the sour lime taste blends so well with the sweet graham cracker my family loves it as well cool delicious and easy
5,very easy to assemble am wondering if other flavors could be easily substituted as well strawberry raspberry seems it would work as long as you have matching yogurtjellos
5,this was very light and easy to make i make it for work on st pats day
5,made this for my office for st patricks day everybody loved it am planning to make again to take in for easterone in peach and one in strawberry super yummy
5,this is a very tasty dessert i have made it for my diabetic sister and my dieting self its really good the only thing i did differently was i froze it instead of refridgerating it
5,i found this recipe in for st pats day and have made a variety of flavors this and all the variations have been big hits the banana split one is the bestvery well drained crushed pineapple strawberry yogurt and jello with fresh strawberries chopped some coconut too and small pieces of dark chocolate mixed with the cool whip is a great flavor too slice a banana on the bottom and pour all the rest on top in the graham cracker crust decorate with a few sliced strawberries and or coconut
5,light low cal and doesnt taste like it also is a weight watchers recipe

5,thanks for that tipdidnt think about thatas im sure other hadnt
5,this was great the only thing is you can not get lime yogurt here so i mixed rapsberry yogurt with the lime jello and it was a great combo
5,i loved this i used the yoplait thick yogurt i have also paired this with other flavors of yogurt and jello with the same great results
5,i made this at easter using lime juice instead of water for all my fussy eaters everyone loved it my daughter has since made it using different flavors of jello juice and yogurt and it continues to be a hit a friend put the juice back on the heat after stirring in the jello it quickly dissolved completely i actually added a little lime zest to my pie for extra lime flavor yum
5,pi have used different jello flavors with matching yogurts on this onepeach is greatp
5,i have made this recipe several times twice for events i catered and also for my family everyone loves it its so quick and easy but people thing you really fussed

5,this recipe was extremely easy to make and very tasty i used a chocolate crust instead of a graham cracker crust i will make this again and try it with different gelatins and yogurts strawberry sounds good with fresh strawberries layered in the bottom
5,this is so easy and fast to make i will try it with other flavors too
5,this was so good and so easy you could easily switch the jello and yogurt flavors to make the pie different
5,i put the pie in the freezer add a little whipped topping and it is delicious served frozen
5,i have made this soup or times it is so good i have also taught a couple of people how to make it since they loved it when they had it at my house i also used beef broth rather than bouillon and water and also added onion and garlic we also use green peppers and red pepper this is a recipe ill use for years to come
5,tasty mistake we loved i made batch for the of us and accidently used diced tomatoes and green chilies oz can in my pantry right next to diced tomatoes on shelf it gave it just a little more kick i didnt add salt and i stir fried about cup of chopped onions with the ground beef it was delicious and my husband really liked it
5,this soup is so good
5,great recipe love changing the peppers when local produce is in season very tasty and the smell is great thanks
5,i do a lot of cooking and have been making this since i first saw it in toh years ago it is my absolute favorite soup in my large repertoire people that tell my they hate bell peppers ask me for this soup when we get together i use green red and yellow pepperswhatever i have on hand i do add a little garlic and worcestershire but its fine without it very hearty healthy and comforting
5,this was great added some stuff lots of garlic onions a dash of worcestershire jalapenos diced with a house full of extremely picky eaters they all loved this soup i think its a first for me
5,i really liked this soup i found it interesting that the rice needs to be cooked beforehand and cant cook in the broth while the soup simmers for min but followed the recipe aswritten and give this five stars was a bit sweeter than expected so next time i might decrease the amount of brown sugar
5,made this for the second time today followed the original recipe the first time and then today incorporated ideas from some of the reviews and we liked it much better instead of cups of water i used cups of beef cooking stock and cups of water also added cup of onions with the beef and cup of celery and couple teaspoons of garlic when adding the tomato sauce etc lastly i added tbsp worcestershire sauce for flavor and the result was great
5,love this recipe its my go too my taste of home recipe is from and calls for quarts of water i substitute cups of beef stock we like a thicker soup a few other tweaks i use cup of uncooked rice and teaspoon of pepper this soup never stays very long in the refrigeratorif it makes it that far you wont go wrong with this recipe
5,this delicious soup like so many other reviewers have said will now be in the dinner rotation even my extremely picky husband enjoyed it
5,just made and it is yummy the brown sugar must be one of ingredients that makes it so tasty
5,love this recipe even my husband loves it and he does not like rice this one is a keeper
5,hello from clarion pa krista in meadville she probably has nothing to do with the actual post and just a blurb about the restaurant let alone the comments section and will never see this i am going to hope she does see it this turned out great i did a few swap outs because teenager i used crushed tomatoes instead of diced i recommend putting soup over your rice or grain of choice i have made a few different versions over the years and found out id say kind of the hard way the first time i made it to separate the grain and soup you really cant store or reheat it well with it added in during cooking i got gloop instead of soup the next day
5,i made this tonight and it couldnt have been easier plus it was really delicious this is a keeper as i write this review my husband is getting himself seconds
5,love this soup modifications used no salt added beef stock instead of water and bouillon cubes added chopped onion used ground turkey lean and added t worcestershire sauce i will freeze this soup without rice my recipe makes servings uses c cooked rice per serving we are following ww and this equals points
5,another go to recipe for me ive made this a number of times but do not use the rice in the actual soup since it gets mushy for leftovers and i love them instead i just serve the rice separately so each can take the amount they want i learned this from motherinlaw who served her chili this way
5,this is a keeper made as written except i reduced the sodium using lower sodium tomatoes tomato sauce and bullion very easy to put together and was excellent
5,i dont often rave over my own cooking but this soup is amazing i added a large white onion marjoram and sage reduced the simmer time to total so the veggies stayed crisp best soup ever
5,really good soup kids dont like green peppers or tomatoesuse red peppers and run tomatoes through the blender use better than bullion in place of water and a dash of worcestershire sauce
5,this is delicious and even better reheated another keeper i love making homemade soup thats quick and easy and tasty enough for after work preparation this one fits the bill
5,my whole family loves this soup easy to put together and the ingredients are probably staples in many kitchens hearty and flavorful great for a cold winter day or a rainy day although we didnt make any changes initially since we dont like tomatoes we decided to try substituting oz of tomato sauce for the oz can of undrained diced tomatoes wonderful most people will probably enjoy the recipe just as orginally submitted and it is wonderful thank you for sharing the recipe
5,we had an abundance of tomatoes and green peppers in out summer garden so i was able to those fo the diced tomatoes and green pepper i did not use cooked rice but since the soup was simmering i let the rice cook in the soup everyone loved it
5,my family enjoyed this
5,soooooo yummy
5,this soup is yummy and the hubby loved it too i added a large onion two cloves of garlic and a few splashes of worchesire sauce i did not put rice in it will definitely make it again
5,delicious will make again
5,best stuffed pepper soup i have ever had only change i made was adding cups of cooked rice instead of
5,one of the best soups ever i didnt use beef bullion but used litre of beef broth and cups of water also as others have said added an onion chopped celery garlic a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce and a few dashes of hot sauce if your kids dont like diced tomatoes omit them and add an extra can of tomato sauce
5,this soup is absolutely amazing my kids thought it tasted like tacos and enjoyed topping the soup with shredded cheese sour cream and crumbled tortilla chips for a fun fiesta kind of feel
5,absolutely delicious easy tasty and filling
5,best chicken pot pie ive ever eaten omg i roasted two large chicken breasts beforehand and steamed whole red potatoes then peeled and diced afterward i also used a package of frozen peas and carrots makes a supercreamy pot pie enough for pies be sure to vent your pies on top they need to let out steam mine cracked on top but who cares it was fantastic
5,made this today and was very pleased i left out the onions and corn i diced the carrots and potatoes used one can of libby green peas i used three chicken breasts and two thighs and boiled them so i had some real chicken broth for the milk i used evaporated milk one cup milk cup water i didnt use a bottom crust for the top crust i used a storebought pie crust and rolled it out thinner to fit a x oblong pan husband bragged on it without any prodding i only used half the filling so i plan to make another to share with someone tomorrow i really like the fact that it makes two pot pies will be making this again
5,been making this for a couple of years this is the best ive eaten i double the recipe to share with my sons family i am so glad i found this recipeyou will want to save this i promise
5,first time making chicken pot pie this recipe yielded z i used a rotisserie chicken and biscuits on top it was fantastic froze one
5,made this for the first time tonight and it was bomb i made some alterations because my family doesnt like english peas instead i stirred in leftover fresh spinach for color and it was all kinds of wonderful make sure you use both dark meat and white meat
5,i used unsweetened almond milk to make it dairy free and bobs red mill gf flour and it turned out greati also threw in a couple cups of chopped fresh baby spinach
5,delicious made this tonight and did not make any changes will be making again loved it
5,the best recipe ive found i used a deep dish pie pan and it came out beautifully will definitely make many times shared a photo of it with my daughter who asked me to make her one this weekend
5,this is such an amazing recipe thank you so much
5,i have been making this for the past three years and we love it the only thing i did not add was the thyme since my husband and i arent a fan of it love the fact that i bake one and freeze one each time i make this recipe
5,great recipelove the whole recipeone correctionit made inch pies so either half the recipe or make sure you have a lot of freezer space or friends to give them toolol

5,easy delicious recipe loved the pie and making it
5,this is easily the most delicious chicken pot pie i have made there is a ton of filling roughly cups per pie for a total of cups of filling i only had large pie pan so i divided the filling in half with a cup measure i will make the other when the dish is clean and freeze it then my house smells heavenly
5,excellent recipe easy to follow delicious i like to sometimes add some bacon toomy son loves it
5,absolutely the best soup recipe a definite keeper
5,so good i used pound each of ground beef and turkey and added some sliced cabbage too definitely a keeper
5,this soup is a christmas eve tradition in my family i use a oz carton of beef broth instead of boullion amp water and a oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce amp diced tomatoes since hubby doesnt like tomato chunks i also use instant brown rice amp add it during the last minutes of cooking hearty amp delicious
5,so easyso good
5,we loved this soup i made only of the recipe to make sure that it would be one that i truly like like others i added the white rice to each bowl first then topped it with the soup and mixed it in i wanted to avoid the common complaint that the rice expanded and got gummy as it sat in the refrigerator the only change i would make is add more green pepper and reduce the amount of fluid i cooked this on the stove for a couple of hours adding fluid as needed i used beef broth and a bit of water and only beef bouillon cube
5,amazing growing upstuffed green peppers were my favorite i did not wish i had know there was such a thing as green pepper soup until i was at an upscale restaurant a few months ago and it was one of my choices for soup i tried it and was blown away how good it was it reminded me of my moms that night when i got homei searched online to find this v recipe i had all the ingredients so the next day i made it and now it is a monthly dinner plus enough for my lunch the next day i did add a few splashes of worcestershire because that was something i remember my mom putting in her stuffed peppers amp with my eyes closed it was liked eating my moms stuffed peppers amazing to put a slice of american cheese on top of each bowl will blow your mind makes it creamy and delicious i am a picky eater so to find this recipe is the best to make it thicker add a little more cooked rice other than that enjoy
5,this recipe is excellent my family loved it my husband who is not big on ground meat would have liked a bit less but did love the taste it is very hearty and great with a salad and crusty rolls
5,this recipe has been so popular so many great reviews i am happy to finally be adding mine i cant add much more then what has already been spoken for its a greet good satisfying soup one that really matures overnightit has the perfect name it does taste like a stuffed pepper due to some diet restrictions i made the following changes no brown sugar or tomato sauce i used very large fresh tomato i used a packet of beefy onion soup mix and added some better than boullion beef base to the mix i upped the amount of green pepper and used less ground beef and i used no ricethis is all about the beefy taste wrapped around green peppersit was most enjoyabletohvfe
5,very easy and delicious i doubled the green peppers and added onion garlic and a little cayenne pepper i didnt add the rice to the soup but put a little rice in the bowls and ladled the soup over the top i served it with some delicious crusty bread my husband and i both loved it this recipe is a keeper
5,this soup is delicious i browned the ground beef and then threw everything but the rice into a crockpot amp cooked on low for hours during the last hours i added the cooked rice to the crockpot i had roasted red peppers so i used cup of those amp cup green peppers leftovers are great too even though it is thicker
5,wonderful recipe i left off the brown sugar i am diabetic and added a half an onion diced and about a cup celery which are two additional ingredients that i include in my stuffed peppers i cooked it in my crockpot on low for hours i will definitely make this again
5,this recipe was great it was quick and easy using ingredients that a lot of people have on hand i cut the recipe in half and it still made a ton i would make this again i added some grated parmesan cheese to mine
5,this soup was delicious i only used lb of hamburger but that was plenty for us i did have a lot leftover so next time ill add the rice to each bowl and not to the entire pan of soup it soaked it up and was no longer soup the next day it was easy enough to thin out with more stock but the rice got a little mushy still good and none went to waste
5,have been trying new recipes found this to be in top easy ingredients always in pantry one pot wonder everyone would place rice in bowls first then sauce over left over rice will be used in another recipe nothing goes to waste mmmm mmmm delish
5,absolutely delicious my husband made this soup for dinner but without the rice for were on the keto diet its a comeback to recipe
5,this tastes delicious i make it often and everyone who tries it says it has great flavor it reminds my of my moms spanish rice from when i was growing up
5,we loved this didnt change a thing also made great leftovers
5,this is excellent easy quick and lm sure it will be even more flavourful tomorrow great make ahead dish i could not bring myself to put sugar in so i didnt i used home canned tomatoes so oz jars i mostly cooked the rice then let it sit and cool awhile so it would not turn to mush and must admit l remembered wrong and added cups of rice also l put a dollop of sour cream on each bowl before the garnish great recipe janet vfe
5,i pulled this recipe out of the recent taste of home magazine i was looking for a quick meal to make and i had all the ingredients on hand with some swap outs i used ground turkey instead of beef sauteed a half an onion with it i thought that c of water would be too much so i cut back to c and used whole low sodium beef bouillon cube for the diced tomatoes i used oz cans and partially drained them before dumping in the pot i only used about tbsp of the brown sugar and no additional salt instead of rice i served it on top of cauliflower rice it was a hit im giving this a because the flavors are amazing and im betting will taste even better tomorrow
5,this soup is awesome i make soups and desserts at a local supper club and i love making this soup i tweak it a bit to my taste and added a few other ingredients definitely a star recipe
5,this soup was excellent i followed other reviewers suggestions and added chopped onion and garlic i didnt have a ounce can of tomato sauce so i used a ounce can of crushed tomatoes i followed the rest of the recipe as written six cups of water did not make it too thin i measured out quart of the soup without rice into a saucepan and added cup of cooked rice for our meal the recipe says it yields quarts but i got additional quarts without rice to freeze i will add cup of cooked rice to each quart when i prepare it so the rice doesnt get mushy this will be a regular goto for our wednesday soup night
5,delicious as written tastes just like stuffed peppers but much easier to make
5,for those of you who do not want to add brown sugar to the soup try a can of stewed tomatoes the sweetness in that type of product should be just right
5,i made this for the st time and definitely not the last time this soup is amazing i doubled it because i share it with family and friends i added fresh chopped garlic and chopped onion i also added envelopes of goya seasoning we slurped it up with some garlic toast and couldnt stop raving about it as we ate it what a perfect soup for fall and a cold day i will definitely be making this in the winter too thank you taste of home for a most excellent recipe
5,a new fave made recipe as is except substituted ground chicken for the beef great the next day too
5,this recipe was delicious i used fresh peppers and tomatoes from my garden i emptied the oz can of tomato sauce and used that to measure my own diced tomatoes i also used about cup more of cooked rice which made it a little thicker but it was still soup since theres just two of us the recipe made enough for me to freeze two more dinners great for a cold fall or winter day for sure
5,my husband begs me to make this awesome soup i did use no salt added tomatoes and sauce and i cut the water to cups andthe second time if there is any left over from the first making i put cups in a quart freezer bag for when my husband begs againjims wife sharon
5,please dont rate recipes if you dont follow the recipe directions make as is and rate it otherwise there is no point to it
5,very good hardy and quicksand essy ill use it again five stars
5,this soup is awesome my husband raves about it and we especially enjoy it with corn chips
5,this soup was delicious the first time it was served however the rice soaked in a lot of the liquid so the second time i served it the taste was great but the texture was mushy i will definitely make it again but wont plan on leftovers as other reviewers suggested i added chopped onions
5,delicious like others said i added diced onion to the ground beef since we like thicker soup i started out with two cups of water with the option of adding more but it ended up being more than enoughi let it cook down once i removed the lid i used white minute rice and added it in once the soup was done rather than letting it cook the entire time also i only added one tablespoon of brown sugar splenda blend and skipped salt since the beef bouillon made it plenty salty
5,i did not use the brown sugar but added whole onion chopped and to teaspoon of garlic powder i also only added quart of water for a thicker soup this is awesome
5,easy to make and tastes great
5,i made this exactly as the recipe calls and it made a ton of soup it was delicious i will definitely make this again although next time i will half the recipe or reduce the amount of liquids i didnt have a problem with mushy rice at all
5,this recipe is delicious id prepared it this was my adaptation of the recipe one can oz sliced mushrooms drained one can oz italian diced tomatoes undrained cups instant brown rice cooked large green pepper chopped medium onion finely chopped beef bouillon cube cup water lb ground turkey cooked to tsp salt for taste to tsp pepper for taste cup marinara sauce this soup tasted just like stuffed peppers too it is definitely a keeper recipe delowenstein
5,this was wonderful i also halved the recipe as there are only two of us i omitted the brown sugar and added chopped onion as one of the reviewers suggested ill definitely make again
5,i took this to an annual soup and salad lunch my ladies group has every january and it was a hit i only made slight changes as the recipe is written here i added a small chopped onion as i was browning the meat reduced the brown sugar to tablespoons and added one quart of beef broth instead of quarts water and the beef bouillon everything else was the same as the recipe written here i say that because the recipe published in the magazine in did not call for any water at all why does the website recipe say to add quarts of water did the restaurant notify the magazine after it came out that they had forgotten to include it in their recipe when they sent it in or did the toh test kitchen add it if so why im not complaining just wondering anyway i will be definitely make this again
5,this is a winner with my family and our boys college roommates i added onion a jalapeo cloves garlic grated carrots amp quart water with beef base because i cook the rice separately it freezes better that way too
5,i made this recipe incorporating some changes recommended by other reviewers we are just two unless our grown children come so we halved the recipe except for the rice and green peppers added onion amp garlic and sauteed them with the green pepper amp ground meat used beef broth instead of water added the rice right at the end despite the changes i am giving this as the end result is so delicious and it is so easy to make we loved it and the leftovers as wellnext time i will try it without brown sugar and adding some smoked paprika for a little spicier taste
5,loved itadded onion more cups waterbullion more pepperwill be one of my go to meals so easy
5,this was fantastic i did add some garlic and chopped onion everyone loved it defiantly a keeper
5,this soup is delicious i belong to a soup club at work and it was my turn i used two smaller cans of diced tomatoes one with onion and the other with roasted garlic everyone loved it
5,my husband said that this soup is the best he has ever had i added a half cup of chopped onion when i browned the hamburger and i used minute rice adding it about ten minutes before serving then i sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese on to serve it
5,this looks awesome and i love some of the reviews i too thought about c chopped onion and also changed to qt water and qt chicken stock makes the juices a little richer i love those like me that think to tweak a recipe to maybe make it a little better yum
5,great recipe but i did make a couple changes substituted lg carton of beef broth for one of the two quarts of water added a cup of chopped onion and substituted crushed tomatoes for the tomato sauce also simmered it min
5,my husband and i loved this i have to say i went through my cabinets and used random cans of tomatoes and sauce one can of tomatoes was garlic the other was with onions and green peppers one of my tomato sauces was italian and the other was plain i also did the minute rice in the last or minutes mine turned out more like stuffed peppers without taking all of the time of boiling and baking i will definitely make this again thank you
5,i gave the recipe stars but none of them showed up o
5,this will easily become one of my favorite soup recipes it tastes just like stuffed peppers and oh so easy to make not sure why the recipe says that it makes only quarts i cut the recipe in half and still had cups of soup
5,oh my goshthis is a terrific dump and cook soup we enjoy this soup each and every time i make iteven for company
5,ohh my gosh so yummy and easy made tonight for dinner
5,super easy and tastes delicious
5,very yummy my husband amp my parents really loved it and my dad is very picky nowadays i used pounds of meatloaf mix meat instead of only ground beef cause beef is just so expensive and it was wonderful i also kicked up the spices a little with montreal steak seasoning when browning meat and a little crushed red pepper so good and those of us who wanted added a little texas pete to soup when we ate with grilled cheeses had plenty to freeze too even better reheated will be making a lot
5,always wanted this recipe easy fast and delicious thanks
5,this soup was very very good
5,great soup to kick off the cold weather today my changes were i added cup finely chopped onion while browning meat then i simmered the peppers alone in olive oil for mins with some basil oregano and the salt amp pepper used cup brown sugar only beef cube amp added can of chicken broth made extra rice for those who like less hearty fare
5,so so good we spiced it up by using italian sausage instead of hamburger and made it thick by using cups uncooked rice instead of cooked rice plenty of liquid in the original recipe to allow the rice to cook up well
5,ive made this recipe for years great stuff also make a great pasta sauce if made a little thicker adjust spices to suit your taste on any given day
5,this recipe is so very tasty followed the recipe and we all loved it
5,easy and is very good
5,this recipe was so good im an older senior who needs easier things to make i love stuffed green peppers amp i cook a lot this made it so much easier to get that taste without all the work i put in the brown sugar as i dont care for sweet food
5,my husband loves this soup its perfect for a cold winters night with some crusty bread and butter
5,tasted great
5,great soup for some more flavor use the garlicherb diced tomatoes adds great flavor to it
5,my hubby loves this more than stuffed peppers he says you get more of everything in bite and it is much easier to eat
5,i used cans of garlic flavored pasta sauce in place of tomatoe juice i increased water and added peppers added two cans stewed tomatoes cups rice
5,great soup base add garlic add cayenne pepper i used the larger diced tomatoes and it made enough soup to try and freeze love this recipe
5,have been on the hunt for the best stuffed pepper soup and this is it i used a box of beef broth and no added salt for half of the water and a can of italian tomato sauce also added cup orzo pasta i debated using the brown sugar but dont be afraidit is delicious
5,love this soup making another pot today
5,this was a really great recipe so many recipes online these days are fails but this worked perfectly for our familys preference i used cup butter instead of cup the recipe still worked just fine with half the butter we also prefer a bit more seasoning so i added a teaspoon of my poultry seasoning and some ground cayenne pepper and snuck in a handful of julienned kale for a little extra nutrition im sure the seasoning in the recipe would be just fine as is though for most families the amount of filling this makes is plentiful easily enough for two deep dish pie plates but one could probably even do shallow pie dishes i baked one pie and put the other in the freezer for another night my family loved this recipe thank you for a reliable recipe that we will use again and again
5,i have made this pot pie for several years my father in law loves it thank you for a delicious addition to family traditions
5,every year i make this with thanksgiving leftovers and every year i am so glad i did i usually get pies out of this recipe depending on the size i make and they freeze beautifully i love always having one on hand for a night i dont feel like cooking and can just pop one in the oven for a few hours and walk away
5,this chicken pot pie recipe is really good i got pies out of it and had plenty of leftovers my family loved it will definitely make this again
5,this is at least the th time i have made this i use half the butter and just a little over half the flour i add a pound of mushrooms cooked down so as not to add liquid i use shallots instead of onion i then throw in a bunch of garlic parsley basil a little marjoram no thyme since it is just the two of us i bake both and after they have chilled i cut them into dinner slices wrap them individually and freeze them stunningly delicious pot pie
5,best chicken pot pie recipe make your own crusts or buy them but you will get four pies if you follow the recipe which is even better freeze em buy the deep dish ones too
5,ive made this many times this last time i made it i bagged the extra filling and stuck it in the fridgeits been days now im wondering if uts still good to stick in a pie crust amp bake aurthor if your seeing this i really gotta know
5,this was the first and only recipe that ive used for chicken pot pie and absolutely love it it was extremely easy to follow the recipe and my entire family devours it every time i subbed the milk out for almond milk and it was delicious i thinned the mixture a little bit with some extra milk and chicken broth and the mixture turned out to have a really nice consistency
5,i made it exactly as written and it is so very good i cant imagine a better recipe though this is the first homemade pot pie ive made the comments about it being too thick to me are very unfounded i thought at first it was awfully thick but the end result was perfection in my opinion i would not have wanted it any thinner it would have been a mess this slices well and mmmmmm good you wont want to lose this recipe
5,i dont like corn and peas so i upped the other vegetables and added celery i also sautéed my chicken with thyme and rosemary as well as added a tsp of rosemary to the filling pies came out amazing i froze mine first and used them later following the tips at the bottom
5,by far the best chicken pot pie i have ever made while i followed recipe exactly as written i did find i had to add a bit more milk delicious
5,this is my favorite pot pie recipe the only thing i change is the frozen veg im weird i prefer canned but tonight i still have fresh corn so i will use that but the best recipe seriously
5,i came i saw i made i loved it
5,a big hit with my husband amp sons i used homemade tomato sauce amp fresh chopped tomatoes great way to use up garden produce my sons now call this my favorite soup i use half the water i usually use stock if i have it on hand to replace the water the sugar i usually use sucanat double the green peppers or any color peppers i have on hand and canned or homemade tomato puree if i have fresh tomatoes i just chop those up to replaced the canned tomatoes or put them in my food processor to puree them in place of the tomato sauce i have used cooked barley instead of rice and all varieties of ricered black jubilee rice brown riceinstead of white rice each pot is always met with rave reviews you can definitely boost the nutrition of this with a few simple changes thank you so much krista muddiman for a soup that im sure one day my sons wives will request the recipe
5,i would not change a thing marvelous
5,this soup was wonderful i will make it often i sauteed the peppers a bit before i browned the ground beef and added onion nothing to change the taste it was delicious we all loved it
5,i made this last night and declare it a winner i made just a couple small changes first i halved the recipe i omitted the brown sugar and added chopped onions even halved it made a lot of soup this is a delicious soup and i will definitely make it again worth five stars
5,we love this soup at this time of year we have an abundance of peppers and tomatoes so when i make it i substitute cups of diced fresh tomatoes in the winter i use canned tomatoes and green and red peppers that i have frozen with great results
5,the best i have tasted
5,this recipe first appeared in the toh cookbook and its been my familys favorite ever since in fact everyone who has ever tasted it has asked for the recipe
5,this is a very yummy and quick soup to make usually have all the stuff on hand my only changes were to brown the beef wthe green peppers and added onions celery and garlic as i just love those flavors in soup and substituted beef broth for the water and bouillon and added extra cup of rice mmmmmmm
5,woah so how did i not know this soup existed yumi added everything except the bullion cubes and switched out the plain diced tomatoes for rotel instead and added the worcestershire sauce like another review said to and its got just the right heat with the rotel you wont need anymore bon appetit
5,i made this tonight and everyone loved it it was the perfect taste on this chilly fall day it has so much flavor
5,ive made this soup several times and its always a winner in our house i cant stand green peppers but can tolerate the milder yellow and orange varieities so thats what i use i also use less water to give it a richer taste all in all one of our favorite soups
5,i made this over the weekend and planned on using it for a couple of meals throughout the week my suggestion do not put the rice in until you are ready to eat it i put all the rice in and the next morning it was just a big ball of riceall the liquid absorbed i was very disappointed
5,i tweaked the recipe a bit i only had lb of ground beef i did not use tomato sauce just the diced tomatoes oz i used only about cups of water and only c of brown sugar i added a diced onion minced garlic about tbsp of worestershire and a few dashes of hot pepper sauce since i reduced the amount of brown sugar i added just a dash of clove instead of rice i added c of barley it was amazing
5,outstandingsome changes i madei browned the ground beef with a diced onioni also used one oz can of diced tomatoes and one oz can of diced tomatoes with habaneros for a bit of kickand used more rice to make the soup thicker
5,i look for hearty soup recipes this one is delicious and fillingi made some modifications to it i used venison sausage instead of beef added cups of rice instead of reduced the pepper and eliminated the salt only used the salt in the beef bouillon cubes served with homemade rye bread big hit
5,i own a deli and serve soups every day i look for new ideas all the time i saw this recipe tried it and it was a hit i did substitute beef broth because i dont like water in soups i also added more pepper and rice this is a keeper for plain nuts deli
5,made this for my family and everyone loved it i will definetly make this again
5,one of the most delicious soups to make when its cold outside so many flavor layers i did use ground turkey added some worcestershire sauce vegetable stock instead of water used honey instead of sugar quinoa instead of rice and used can of italian diced tomatoes and can of fire roasted diced tomatoes
5,wow this was a hit during the latest deep freeze in the northeast i followed suggestions here and added an onion amp minced garlic to the beef used beef stock marinara sauce better than boullion beef base amp diced tomatoes with jalapenos plus an additional cup of peppers brown rice into the bowl when serving because its what i had on hand a nice sprinkle of parmesan cheese is a mustit isnt stuffed peppers without the cheese my family amp neighbors enjoyed this so muchi may never make traditional stuffed peppers again thank you hosses for the keeper recipehahawell look at that making it again after a storm almost three years exactly to the date yummo house smells crazy good

5,decided to try this recipe after my boyfriend requested stuffed peppers we both thought the leftovers from this recipe would be better for reheating than actual stuffed peppers based on other reviews i added a whole chopped onion amp cloves of garlic to the ground beef as it browned i used quarts of reduced sodium beef broth and brown long grain rice i also reduced the salt to teaspoon and added tablespoon of dried basil and teaspoon each of dried rosemary and thyme we topped it with shredded extra sharp cheddar and had crusty french bread on the side it was extremely filling and fairly healthy i used lean ground beef and with the additional spices we found it very flavorful i hope it will reheat well as my freezer is stocked full of it
5,update had a ton of leftovers and froze them im happy to report this soup freezes and reheats extremely well
5,my husband who doesnt like stuffed peppers loved this soup it was an instant favorite from the first bite awesome recipe i didnt add all the water called for and used half sausage instead of all beef a keeper for sure
5,i love this soup
5,my family is very pleased with this recipe i did read through the reviews before making and decided to make some adjustments of my own i started off by cooking the green peppers with lb of ground beef not which i seasoned with garlic powder onion powder and a little seasoning and kosher salt i also used beef stock instead of water and cut it back to about oz oz box container and one oz can instead of quarts my family and i like a thicker consistency with our soups so i added a little at a time making sure it was just right i also used c of cooked instant brown rice thats what i had in the pantry since another review recommended it this soup turned out way better than expected and my so says its definitely a keeper i also liked the idea of serving it with bread so i added hawaiian sweet rolls to our meal yummy

5,this really tasted like stuffed peppers without all the fuss i used red and yellow sweet peppers very good
5,very very tasty i substituted boullion cubes for the granules used less tha cup of brown sugar and used tsp kosher salt for the regular salt very easy and quick i took this to a person luncheon and brought home very little everyone asked for the recipe thanks

5,this was an awesome soup but i did make a few changes as others didused beef broth added a large onion amp a little garlic to meat when browningalso spiced it up with a palm full of dried basil and a lesser amount of dried rosemary thyme amp marjoramtasted just like the stuffed peppers mom used to make everyone gobbled it up also used sweet red and yellow peppers since some have digestion issues with the green
5,this soup is easy to make and very very tasty as well as filling we loved it and i would make it again
5,the brown sugar adds just the right amount of sweetness excellent soup
5,i made this recipe with some slight variations diced half an onion and sauted the peppers and onions in a tbsp of extra virgin olive oil for several minutes then i added a clove a fresh garlic minced instead of beef i used ground turkey to cut down on fat and used beef broth instead of water omitting the beef boullion granules came out great and we loved it will make it again

5,i made this recipe a few days ago and we are just finishing up the leftovers this soup was great i did make a few changes to it but didnt do anything unusual i used lbs ground beef and added cups of cooked rice to the soup cups of rice wasnt nearly enough it had too much broth with that small amount i did use beef stock instead of water because water doesnt bring anything to the party if you get my meaning the soup was excellent and i will definitely make it again thank you for a wonderfull recipe
5,this soup was delicous even dh who is not really a soup guy loved it i did make a couple improvements to the original recipe instead of water i used qts beef broth i added one small onion diced i used seasoned pepper instead of regular pepper i used left over rice and added it to the bowls before i ladeled the soup over garnished with a touch of shredded yellow cheese yummy
5,these are so easy and came out great i made them in my wilton leafpumpkin pans and they are just so cute and taste wonderful i think they are the best cupcakes ive made yet knightstown in
5,my family loved these cupcakes i didnt even get a chance to frost them the recipe is easy the results are great
5,this is a great recipe but it only made cupcakes not if i made them again i would cut the frosting recipe in halfway too much left over
5,everybody had to take two because they were so delicious
5,wow very easy and delicious they dont last long will definitely be making again
5,these were amazing i didnt have ginger but substituted nutmeg they still were fabulous cant wait to make more
5,these cupcakes are delicious i will make them again for sure i followed the recipe exactly and it made large not jumbo cupcakes as well as mini cupcakes i also think they would make cute mini loaves
5,i am a secretary for an elementary school and i made a batch of these cupcakes to share with the staff at schoolthey were a big hit and i had several requests for the recipe i will definately make these cupcakes again
5,these are really good i took they to work for our halloween party and everyone wanted the recipe maybe i didnt fill the cups as much as recommended because it made more than dozen
5,won the office potluck with this great recipe i think next time ill add more cinnamon to the frosting i also suggest that you keep the frosting room temprature until youre sure youre finished with it as its super sticky and very hard to work with cold
5,great recipelast reviewer states it only makes not cupcakeslook at the recipe specs again it states the recipe makes cupcakesi used an ice cream scoop to fill my tins full and got extremely large cupcakes
5,absolutely delish my yr old daughter just loved them too i plan on using the frosting recipe for my next batch of cinnamon rolls
5,is there a high altitude version of this recipe we love it but have moved to colorado and i cannot get the cake right
5,this is my goto cake now everyone that i have served it to raved about this cake i use my favorite lavazza coffee for the brewed coffee i substitute canned evaporated milk for the whole milk my favorite frosting is a peanut butter frosting and i use it with this cake i put a few piped swirls of frosting on top and top each swirl with a reeses peanut butter cup
5,this soup was hearty and wonderful on a cold winter night i did substitute about oz of sausage and used ground round instead of ground beef i also used both green amp red peppers it is a lovely dinner soup
5,i couldnt find plain diced tomatoes so i used the kind with green chilies in it it was way too spicy ill try it again without the chilies and hope its not so spicy will definitely make again though
5,i love this recipe so easy and i usually have all the ingredients on hand i make it several times a year and my family loves it
5,this is sooo good my kids dont like stuffed peppers but they love this ive served it in bread bowls made from dough using my bread machine and then baked i dont cook the rice beforehand i put cup uncooked rice and cups extra water in the last minutes of simmering turns out great i also subbed chicken bouillon for the beef cause thats what i had on hand delicious hearty soup
5,awesome i used large green pepper and red pepper the flavors were awesome also i used lb ground round lb sweet italian sausage and about lb of left over meatloaf and brown rice definitely a makeagain recipe
5,i used a vegetarian meat substitute morningstar farms crumbles instead of ground beef i also used cans of vegetable broth instead of the water and bouillon i did make it with cups of cooked brown rice in the pot the entire time and it was fine great recipe my family loved it
5,this recipe does call for cups cooked long grain rice so i dont know why it would turn out gummy you are supposed to cook the rice before you add it to the soup this is absolutely a wonderful soup even my husband who doesnt like stuffed peppers or green peppers at all for that matter loves this soup i add a small chopped onion and saute the onion and green pepper when i brown the ground beef drain then add the rest of the ingredients delish
5,this soup was really good i was skeptical but the photograph looked so good i decided to try it it was my first time making it so i followed the recipe next time i make this i will cut back on the amount of water but other than that it was perfect it does actually taste just like stuffed peppers with much less work
5,use quarts beef stock omit the water and beef bouillon cook rice on the side
5,update to previous review i seasoned the leftovers with just a bit about tsp of garlic powder and it made such a dramatic change it was delicious
5,wonderful chocolate cake worth the effort my new favorite chocolate cake it took my cake layers about minutes to cook until they were done in the middle
5,i know different areas cooking time can be different but in oregon it took my inch round cakes minutes to bake
5,i just had to make this cake because i was intrigued with the frosting as with other reviewers it did take longer than minutes per recommendations of some of the comments i made more icing than what the recipe calls for this cake is wonderful and the frosting is great
5,this has been my favorite chocolate cake recipe for years now and has been my go to cake recipe my aunt loved the cake so much that she asked me for the recipe and made it for a bridal shower and everyone loved it my cousin also asked for the recipe and entered the cake in a contest at school and won i got this recipe from your magaine years ago
5,an amazing cake not difficult to make and delicious following some of the reviews i used blackdark cocoa for half of the cocoa and made an extra half batch of icing using a bit more vanilla to bump up the icing flavour we found that the icing really complements the cake definitely a make again
5,awesome recipe made a few times and always consistent results
5,first time to try this recipe its easy and i love it
5,this was very good i made it the day before and kept in fridge eating the cake chilled may have made it better i did double the icing recipe and made layers of cake i will definitely make this again for an event better than store bought bday cake
5,i have been making this cake for years its my favorite cake and i love the frosting its moist and delicious
5,delicious have been looking for a cake like this for years icing is amazing thank you
5,i have been making this cake for over years it is the absolute best everyone loves it
5,the best chocolate cake and icing ever moist and delicious reminiscent of sara lee cakes of days gone by icing is perfection just sweet enough and super creamy similar to seven minute frosting and easier goodbye buttercream icing
5,this for chinyere if you are worried about the coffee flavor in the cake you cant tell it is there if you dont want the caffeine use decaf yes you can use regular cocoa i used hersheys i made it in a regular cake pan different times and it turned out great cooking time at was minutes kick it up a notch with this icing be sure to double this icing recipe
5,i made this for mothers day desert fabulous everyone loved it moist and really quick to put together the icing is excellent as well not to sweet i put almost a cup of good raspberry jam on the bottom layer and put the icing on the bottom of the top layer shaped them together and it was perfect i decorated the cake with fresh raspberries the leftover cake is now days old and just as delicious as the first day i bake the cake a day ahead and iced in the morning this will be my go to chocolate layer cake
5,the cake was phenomenal my family loved it and when i brought to my bake sale it was the only item that was sold out completely the only thing i added to it was a little more flour because the recipe was a little too liquidy other than that it was an awesome cake
5,this is my go to birthday cake for our whole family it has never failed it is always so moist it does not have a coffee taste in case someone is curious it is not overly chocolate but just right ive doubled it before when making my kids multilayered multishaped birthday cakes everyone always complements it i have made the frosting listed in the recipe but have made other favorite frostings instead too mostly because i dont use shortening i use all of my organic ingredients and follow the recipe exactly someone said the center comes out rawthe recipe does state that the batter will be very liquidy and it is however it does bake thoroughly without adding excessive time i typically average a few extra minutes and its perfect it also does freeze great without frosting when im making shaped birthday cakes i freeze my cutoff extra pieces as im layering and then take them out for a later day sometimes i frost the pieces after removing from the freezer when serving but not always theyre great without it too
5,hands down favorite chocolate cake recipe the coffee really helps with the color and flavor i swap out the oil for butter and it gives it a richer and a bit denser taste and texture yum
5,perfect chocolate cake i have used this recipe many times and refuse to use any other chocolate cake recipe
5,this has been my goto chocolate cake since it was originally published in i have made it countless times and it has never failed adding coffee to enhance chocolate is actually a very old trick the unique frosting is also a keeper that i have used on this cake and many others i have never seen frosting using a white sauce paste and granular sugar anywhere else i will say i am glad to have a stand mixer now for the frosting since it takes so long for the granulated sugar to incorporate even if you use fine grain
5,we make this recipe all of the time since i received my first issue of toh it is the requested chocolate cake we do like it with the frosting recipe that comes with it but i have also done it up with chocolate frosting i have reduced the amount of oil to cup and the amount of sugar to about cup
5,oh my gosh this has been our familys favorite cake since i first made it when toh debuted in we have six children amp all of them frequently requested it for birthdays nameday treats halfyear birthdays we celebrate a lot in our family baptismal anniversary days etc our oldest daughter asked me to make it for her wedding reception in oct the only change i make is to make times the amount of frosting amp then use the recipe for the frosting in the toh issue for pastel chocolate cake we call the resulting cake rainbow cake i dont change a thing in the recipes
5,i have found my chocolate cake recipe this is exactly what i was looking for rich dense but not heavy great chocolate flavor very moist delicious i used vegetable oil because its what i had came out beautiful definitely a keeper
5,this icing recipe is my moms french cream frosting exactly and is wonderful not quite as sweet as most but still plenty sweet and ever so smooth cant wait to make this cake
5,best chocolate cake recipe ive ever made my family loved it
5,this is the perfect chocolate cake its super moist it took minutes to bake not which is no big deal also next time i make it i think i need a little more frosting which was equally awesome ps in the frosting use all butter its tasty
5,best chocolate cake recipe ever
5,its a great recipe my grandmothers was the same minus the icing and i know this because this recipe has been on the back of the hersheys cocoa can for generations at least lol
5,this moist chocolate cake is excellent and the delicious frosting takes it over the top
5,ive been eating this cake for the past years and making it for the past its a bit time consuming and the icing takes practice to get just the right consistency for the cooked milkflour icing butit is soooooo worth it this is truly my favorite alltime cake recipe
5,my aunt gave us this icing recipe years ago i remember she had blue hair the cake is excellent too in warm weather i use all crisco in the icing also i use my hand mixer to blend the flour amp milk while its cooking no lumps
5,my favorite cake and frosting perfect every time
5,this cake recipe is delicious i used a different recipe for the frosting so cant comment on the icing provided on here my only complaint is that it sunk a bit in the middle
5,reminds me of your grandmother as well specially of her moist cakes
5,love this cake first time i made it i hesitated putting shortening in the frosting but its so good very moist and chocolateymy kids always ask me to make it for their birthdays definitely a keeper
5,loved it didnt make the frosting but it is awesome just like that thank you
5,excellent
5,good cake
5,delicious i did use half and half regular cocoa powder and special dark cocoa and it is better the second day great cake
5,delicious family loved it
5,our favorite birthday cake to make so moist and heavy i rarely bakebut this cake always comes out perfect no matter what your skill baking level is its the best
5,this is the best cake recipe i have found and i have been looking for a long time i first made it for my motherinlaws birthday and we were all very happy with the results the next time i baked this cake i flavored the icing with mint extract and i am now in the process of repeating that icing for the cake for christmas i have found the cake for any and all of my chocolate cake needs and desires
5,this cake look exactly like the display cake and is so light and moist the icing is similar to whip frosting like i love i will definitely make this again and again in the near future
5,very easy to make i lined pans with parchment paper as suggested and it still stuck a bit on sides though i liberally greased pans very good cake my dad loved it
5,this cake was very moist with a light not very sweet frosting i followed the recipe with the minor suggestion of adding a smidge more cocoa powder for anyone that might find this helpful the cocoa powder was hershey unsweetened for the frosting i used unsalted butter and regular white sugar not confectioners the frosting is enough to generously frost the whole cakei baked in a x round pan with parchment paper on the bottom and sprayed pam all over the pan baked at it did not overflow it baked maybe hr i didnt take the time i also added strawberry filing with a thin layer of frosting in the middle as a personal preference but the cake itself is moist
5,this known as ginnys chocolate cakeyes instant coffee works or coke worksbuy wondra flour for the icing and use real vanilla
5,this is almost the same as a cake i make all the time except there is a lot more oil added some have said there was not enough flavor i always use hersheys special dark cocoa in mine and it makes a huge difference and the frosting recipe is what i use as a filling inside the cake and use a buttercream on top
5,my husband is famous for making this cake in the icing we use t cornstarch instead of the flour and add teaspoon almond extract it is addictive
5,i love this cake
5,this is the best cake i have ever made my family loves it it is always a hit i did have to cook it longer my oven runs a little bit hot and i usually have to reduce cooking time but with this recipe i cooked for an additional minutes
5,does the icing use powdered sugar or granulated sugar
5,i have loved this recipe ever since i found it in the first issue of taste of home the cake is moist and delicious and the icing is superb
5,loved the cake and the frosting my mother and i had a similar version only we didnt use vanilla which is a great extra and shortening was substituted with margarine instead
5,this is the hersheys cocoa recipe for the cake and the waldorf astoria recipe for the frosting but regardless of who created it the cake and frosting are delicious together ive been making it for around years the coffee adds a really rich flavor to the chocolate cake but doesnt make it taste like coffee the cake has a very moist crumb also im not a huge chocolate fan and i cant do chocolate frosting on top of chocolate cake so i love the contrast of the vanilla flavored frosting this cake keeps well in the fridge and maintains its moisture nicely
5,havent made the recipe yet we have a christmas bazaar this weekend coming up and ill make some regular size ones to sell and mini ones for the luncheon table should sell out i love pumpkin anything
5,this was absolutely delish my whole family loved them even the kids i made it a second time as a cake takes at least twice the baking time as the cupcakes well worth the wait just wonderful it is not complicated very easy to make
5,excellent i grated fresh nutmeg on the top of the cupcakes beautiful and delicious
5,these were delicious i made them for my belgian friend and she loved them it was here first ever cupcake and it was a huge hit they are super moist and i used the leftover icing on warmed banana nut bread wow
5,reviewed nov by birdladythey were great went over well at our church thanksgiving dinner i sprinkled toasted pecans on top of the frosting which gave them a little crunch and special taste
5,i made these cupcakes yesterday and used fresh pumpkin that i had just baked and pureed i used the same amount as a can of pumpkin they turned out great nice and moist i used buttercream frosting and added cinnamon to the icing will definitely make again
5,fabulous high in fat though took it to a party nods of approval everywhere
5,yes i substituted milk and lemon juice also for the buttermilk some collapsed and some didnt dont know why they still were a hit
5,a keeper these were so moist i made exactly as directed with no substitutions and they were perfect sprinkled ground pecans on topddddlish
5,very moist and rich a little heavyas mine did not raise well they seem to spread out over the top of the muffin tin i would use non stick spray on the top before i put my cupcake liners in i also put frosting in ziploc bag snipped corner and squeezed out the frosting on each cupcake this cut my frosting time in half
5,first time making these cupcakes and they came out great everyone at worked loved them followed recipe exactly and it does truly make cupcakes the frosting was wonderful to die for in fact i kept a few cupcakes without the frosting and they were equally as good
5,i made this for girls night out and everyone loved them
5,delisheverybody loved them
5,stars for the cupcakes but i added more cinnamon the frosting was to me sickening sweet way too much sugar for mebut thats my taste
5,my friends and my husbands coworkers loved these im definitely taking them to the inlaws for thanksgiving
5,this is the second time ive made this cake and it came out great both times the cake is very moist and has a smooth chocolate flavor i actually prefer this frosting because its not as sweet as most it allows for the chocolate flavor of the cake to stand out after baking it it does tend to stick a little to the bottom of the pan so i might try the parchmentwax paper suggestion next time i didnt have problems with the baking time both layers were finished in the minute suggested time
5,i made this cake for valentines birthday cake my family loves it it did stick to pan so will use waxed oaper next time put red food coloring and it was perfect
5,best and easiest chocolate cake ever however it is not light and airy but rather very dense and heavy fabulous also the icing listed here is extremely heavy and if refrigerated is very thick and almost solid it is better using a different lighter icing
5,this is our very favorite chocolate cake we have been making it for over years we renamed it suzie q cake because thats exactly what it tastes like
5,just made the cake it was reallygood
5,so good
5,this chocolate cake is amazing easy moist and nice chocolate flavor you can taste the coffee in the batter but not in the cooled cake it just adds a deeper fuller taste sometime i substitute half the cocoa powder with dark chocolate powder i occasionally try different chocolate cake recipes and even if they are good i always come back to this cake as a reliable delicious go to option i have never tried this frosting recipe
5,i have made this cake time and time again my family loves it and i have shared it with many friends i did adjust the temperature up to from and bake time to minutes i still check the center at minutes but thats just a habit the frosting is so light and fluffy if you start the first half of the frosting before you begin putting the cake ingredients together it saves time
5,i just made this cake yesterday ohmygawd yummy i lessened the amount of sugar in the icing and also used powdered sugar instead yummy what a keeper and the cake is moist love it i just wasnt able to use two baking trayspoured it all in oneand ended up with a volcanic cake haha but taste wiseyummeh
5,i just made it then it was delicious love this recipe mmmmm mmmmm d im in australia and substituted copha for the shortening this recipe is amazing d
5,the cake was delicious i did not make the frosting i made it in by pans for a layered birthday cake it was a bit hard to stack but i expected that because i made it in a different pan than intended absolutely delicious though very moist
5,i absolutely love this recipe moist and very flavorful question though i am going to make a in round cake could anyone tell me how many cups of batter this recipe is ive never measured it before with making just in round cakes thanks
5,i love this cake and the frosting is so light and fluffy its like my great grandmothers my middle daughter always wants this for her birthday cake i have found refrigerating the frosting overnight makes it creamier i have added red food coloring so my brother can have his special red velvet cake he dont have a clue
5,this cake has been our go to birthday cake since i found the recipe many years ago in taste of homeit is simply the best and all my family and friends look forward to birthdays so i can make it for them the frosting is so yummy too i have been using a rich european cocoa and this certainly does enhance the flavor and for an additional twist you could use mexican vanilla for the regular vanilla awesome cake i have also made it into cupcakes
5,cant wait to try this recipe but would like to know if it would work as a sheet cake i gave it starts because of all the tremendous already star ratings it has gotten i would though use all butter instead of using shorting in the icing
5,great cake easy to make i use brewed coffee but instant will work as well you just need the flavor of coffee to intensify the chocolate i had never used this icing before but it was great too thanks for sharing
5,love it the cake and the icing thanks for sharing so we can try it
5,usually i make box mix cakes but this cake was delicious and easy enough that i will definitely make again followed recipe exactly cake was moist and delicious the coffee flavor does not come out in the end result if you are worried about that cake cooked in minutes the recipe for the frosting was really nice as well make sure you whisk the flourmilk mixture while its cooking also granulated sugar is the correct sugar to use end result is not grainy at all the end taste of the frosting was light and delicious look was very glossy and shiny frosting was good but the cake is so good on its own you dont need that much frosting next time will cut frosting recipe in half great recipe
5,awesome nothing else is needed to be said
5,is the dry chocolate part the hersheys can unsweetened cocoa
5,made this today first time ive made a cake from scratch that wasnt dry it was so easy and quick turned out fantastic changed the icing a bit used all butter and added a bit of cream cheese and cocoa to make a chocolate icing we loved it
5,made this today and it was incredibly moist and delicious the frosting was a little curdled in appearance i used all butter and no shortening as others suggested but the flavor was fantastic i always use hersheys special dark cocoa for a dark chocolate flavor will definitely make again
5,wonderful made it yesterday i too only used butter for the icing and also curdled a bit but was magic the flavour is amazing what i did add in was some panettone essence to both the cake and icing adds a wonderful flavour will make again
5,one of the easiest moistest best cakes ever i have made it several times with no issues and my mother made it often if you have issues you are not following the instructions exactly and correctly its that simple
5,before i make this we dont drink coffee so have none in the house and dont wish to buy it just for this recipe can someone suggest an alternative how about orange juice water almond milk thank you in advance for your reply
5,i had intended to make a different chocolate cake for an event but realized i didnt have all the ingredients the day i was going to make it just days prior i had come across this recipe and had all the ingredients on hand i normally would not try a recipe for the first time for something special but i had promised to bring a cake so i went for it i made it in a xinch pan putting waxed paper on the bottom of the pan and using cooking spray before pouring in the batter and baked it for minutes i used a buttercream frosting that i had already planned on everyone loved this cake there were other desserts there but mine got eaten first i will be making this again
5,this the the best homemade cake ive ever made or eaten moist with great flavormade this twice and it came out perfect both times
5,extremely moist cake the recipe really does make two inch round cakes plus cupcakes so be prepared i attempted to make the frosting but my shortening was bad i had no idea it went bad i agree though with the wyopink that it tasted waxy next time i would use a cup of butter instead this time i substituted a can of store bought chocolate frosting and my chocaholic loved it thats all that really matters
5,i have never rated a recipe before but this was very very good i followed the recipe as written including the icing and everything turned out great thanks for sharing
5,what an amazing cake usually i do boxed mixes but this was far superior and not much work very moist rich and delicious it was even better the next day i didnt do the frosting recipe but used canned vanilla frosting a thin layer was all you needed because the cake is so rich on its own
5,wow this cake was so good i followed all the directions exactly i brought it to work and everyone raved over it one lady i work with who tends to be critical said it was the best chocolate cake she ever ate i loved the icing too great texture and flavor just make sure you whip it well
5,i made this today and its delicious in fact my whole family likes it i followed the directions exactly baking the cakes in pans they did take about minutes longer to bake than directed but i know that there are oven variations various types of pans etc that would account for the differencefor those hesitant to make this because they dont like coffee i can promise you the cake doesnt taste like coffee im in my mid s have never in my life had a cup of coffee but still enjoy this cake i was a little hesitant about making this frosting as its different from anything ive ever made but it turned out great its not gritty as some said and i like it because its light in texture and not too sweet
5,this cake sounds wonderful will be trying it sooni wouldnt think the shortening would make the frosting not taste good because a lot of butter creams are half shortening half butter as in decorating cakes and reading the frosting recipe i would think either sugar would work i do know cheap shortening does not work as well and you dont want it to be more than a couple of months old but as others have said regarding frosting you really need to beat it good you can almost burn up a hand mixer trying to beat it sometimes thanks for sharing
5,this year i was in charge of my uncles birthday cake i make chocolate cakes a lot but i have never made such a good one i loved it and so did everyone else even my dad who eats lots of chocolate cake and is picky about what he gets said that this was one of the best he had ever had i have never done this before but i printed out this recipe it is definitely a keeper i cooked it for min and used a different vanilla butter cream frosting recipe and it tuned out fantasticbestcakeever b
5,i use a similar recipe for icing but use cup butter instead of the buttershortening mix t flour everything else the same if you beat the butter and sugar well it shouldnt taste grainy we really like it because it isnt as sweet as regular buttercream frosting
5,have used this recipie for years using all butter or margarine for icing no shortening tbl flour is correct
5,i have used this wonderful recipe for many years my children and i have won many blue ribbons and best of show using this recipe i often use a chocolate butter cream frosting
5,ive been making this cake for over years and everyone loves it the coffee enhances the chocolate flavor peanut butter frosting put it over the top
5,this sounds delicious we only drink instant coffee in our house does anyone know the results if instant was substituted for brewed im anxious to try it but dont want to waste the ingredients and ruin it by using instant coffee has anyone baked this with instant coffee
5,love this cake i used to make it years ago i couldnt find the recipe and then i opened my email and there it was i think one could use instant coffee just make a cup of it then add to recipe
5,i followed directions exactly and the cake turned out wonderful i had no problems with the frosting i used regular sugar i just made sure i mixed it well before adding milk mixture this recipe is definitely a keeper
5,cake is wonderful just as is for the frosting its granulated sugar and you must follow the instructions and beat minutes using a whisk attachment if you have one for me it would be better using cup of butter rather than half butter and half shortening as i dont enjoy the shortening taste but it was definitely a nicer consistency than my moms traditional buttercream and ill be making this again using all butter
5,loved the moist chocolate cake recipe the frosting comes out light and sweet i prefer one of those richer frostings so i think i might try a different one maybe even chocolate frosting as well cannot say enough good stuff about this cake that coffee i used was donut shop blend and cooled it before using in the cake delicious
5,this was one of my moms mostrequested recipes this is so delicious and the light nottoosweet frosting brings back memories of mom this recipe is a classic and never disappoints
5,i have been making this cake for years with love my dear motherinlaw who has passed on gave it to me with a shower gift before my wedding the whole family giggles when someone shows up with this cakea cousin has been making it since she was a child and she told me it never let her down its called never fail cake in my household the coffee deepens the flavor and the texture is fluffy amp moist but it is not a coffee flavored cake sometimes i ice it with a peanut butter frosting and then stand back and watch people lick amp scrape their plates yeah its that good if i have to see one more star rating from a reviewer that has not attempted the recipewell ill just have another piece of cake and laugh this isnt pinterest or someones blog it lowers the rating unnecessarily
5,delicious and simple for the icing i used granulated sugar and followed directions to a tee using my wire whisk attachment on my mixer to beat for minutes did not turn out grainy at all
5,this cake is so delicious the only change i made was to use tsp vanilla plus tsp almond extract since i love almond in chocolate i am not a coffee drinker and did not taste any coffee in this cake i took it to a potluck at church and came home with an empty plate the frosting sounded very familiar as i believe i made it many years ago it was not too sweet at all
5,love love love this cake definitely moist and creamy everyone should try this recipe it is easy to make and even if it wasnt it would be worth the wait
5,easy as anything ive ever baked and awesome i did not use the coffee on second one but my hubby is a big coffee drinker so he prefers to add it
5,this is a delicious cake moist with a rich chocolate taste and a lovely icing i followed the directions and the frosting frothed to wonderful consistency thanks to ms kreitz for sharing it its absolutely a keeper
5,excellent cake very moist and wonderful flavor i followed the directions exactly and no issues with grainy texture for the frosting this is a keeper for us thanks so much for sharing
5,made this recipe this weekend for my motherinlaws birthday it was so moist and tasty everyone loved it and asked for more i used cream cheese icing and it was just the right amount of sweet you definitely cannot taste the coffee in it just chocolate yummy chocolate
5,made this cake today and it was delicious nice and chocolaty i used inch round pans and baked at degrees but had to bake for minutes not minutes as stated in the recipe will definitely make this again
5,this cake is amazing you really must try it do use the coffee as well it doesnt taste like coffee i made it with regular and decaf and preferred the decaf cake my husband and our boys also loved the flavor this cake is very moist i wont ever buy another box cake again nowthe frostingnot very good it tasted waxy and like shortening it turned out just as stated but doesnt compare to buttercream i used this frosting recipe the first time i made the cake and was disappointed in it the second time i made it and used a vanilla meringue buttercream and it was perfect thank you for the wonderful cake recipe
5,love i forgot to add oil and the cake was still marvelous this is a keeper
5,the most amazing cake and frosting ever
5,very delicious and moist i am not a coffee drinker and you really dont taste the coffee
5,this is my goto chocolate cake i usually do it in a x or as cupcakes most of the time i make a different frosting or use storebought frosting i like this frosting recipe but it is a little time consuming and i dont have a stand mixer
5,absolutely delicious very moist great flavor i baked it in a x and only make half of the frosting called for and it was the perfect amount will make this again
5,i made this cake for my mothers birthday and everyone raved about it it was really moist and the icing was fluffy and tasted like whipped cream i made it in a x and had to increase the baking time to minutes i will definitely be making it again now my family wants the recipe
5,i made this cake for my sisters birthday and it was excellent since i baked it in a pyrex bowl it took over an hour to bake i was a little worried since i made it half whole wheat and only put in c sugar but it turned out super moist and yummy it was fairly dense but really good i didnt try the frosting though
5,i have made this cak for over years an it is still a good nw asthe first v trie it everyone a work raves over it
5,i am typically not one to eat chocolate cake but since it is my mothers favorite i made this recipe for her birthday i made it exactly as listed and it was amazing i have never had any type of cake that was so moist i cant wait to try the recipe for cupcakes
5,i have been using this recipe for years ever since it was first published the absolute best cake and frosting you can imagine
5,coffee makes the chocolate more tasty and you absolutely do not taste any coffee also the recipe says sugar not confectioners to rate a recipe you havent tested is indeed poor taste
5,i need to tell you this is a cooked icing you cook the flour and milk stirring constantly so there is no lumps and bring it to a boil then take it off the stove to cool down put in fridge until cold take white sugar not confectioners and other ingredients and mix until sugar is dissolved then add the flour and milk mixture and beat for mins till it is light and fluffy i have made this icing for years and it is wonderful good luck
5,ive been making this cake for yrs from the old grange cookbook it is the best chocolate cake ever it is so moist and also tastes great with peanut butter icing for those who do not like coffeeit does not have a coffee taste
5,for new bakers if a recipe simply says sugar it means granulated if powdered or confectioners sugar etc is to be used the recipe then specifies accordingly my students did a great job with this cake
5,any suggestions for altering this for high altitude
5,this is a wonderful cake i also have made it in a by sheet cake and it is great i wish that all those that rate without trying a recipe would please stop there are forums to ask questions in to understand components in the instructions before rating and this would be helpful to them and eliminate unfair ratings for the recipes
5,i made this today for a birthday wanted something different from what i had made before this is an excellent cake received raves from all my family in fact i will be making it again next month for my nephews birthday i had seen recipes for this kind of frosting before but had never made it it is a new favorite for my family
5,years ago i obtained this recipe from one of the taste of home magazines that i received on a monthly basis from the first time i baked this cake and made this icing i have never selected another chocolate cake recipe i have used other icings like cream cheese frosting which is also delicious on it i have made this over and over for friends and family and have always been told it is the most wonderful and delicious cake theyve ever tasted once i made it and took it to a church social and it was chosen to be auctioned off to church members to raise money for the young people it was a lot of fun to see people bidding for it and it sold for a great price as they all knew it was wonderfully delicious ive been asked for the recipe by many family members and friends i have never had this recipe to fail when i made it i love it
5,this is a favorite of mine i cant believe a scratch cake can be so chocolatey and moist the frosting is not so rich and is great for decorating if a buttercream frosting is your preference check out the one at the cake recipes are the same i lost my magazine and was thrilled to find this online
5,best chocolate cake recipe extremely addicting you have to try it it was gone so quick i made it with chocolate icing next time ill have to try the one on the recipe
5,this cake came out as good as everybody said it would i made an x square cake and twelve cupcakes with the recipe given since i didnt have round cake pans with the x cake i poked holes in it and poured chocolate syrup all over the top instead of frosting it was amazing i will definitely be making this cake again
5,the cake was moist and delicious the only problems i had was that it took a much longer time to cook because i used one rectangular pan and i had issues getting the lumps of shortening out of the frosting the cake was delicious and you didnt notice the lumps when the frosting was on the cake so overall amazing will make again
5,best cake ever
5,best chocolate cake and icing ever however i would the icing this cake needs minutes baking
5,best cake ever
5,best cake i ever tasted i made this when it came out in the magazine and thought the icing recipe looked strange it is so light and delicious i have been looking for this recipe ever since i lost it so glad to have found it again
5,excellent cake also delicious with cream cheese frosting
5,i was wondering if the icing uses granulated or powdered sugar i really want to make this for my dads birthday on friday i am trusting the reviews and that i wont ruin it
5,looks great going to try it
5,have made this for yearsfamily loves it and the frosting is excellent
5,my six year old son made these cupcakes for a potluck and they were a hit everyone was asking him for the recipe
5,these are so yummy i made them for my year olds halloween party not such a tough crowd and they were all gone within the hour
5,this turned out beautifully the frosting is a wonderful compliment to the full flavored cupcake
5,great recipe my husband always asks for these i only make half the frosting and it is always more than enough
5,omgosh this is a killer cupcake recipe absolutely love it i wont make any other pumpkin flavored cupcake now this one is too good and the frosting is dlish the cinnamon really adds something special you have to try this recipe
5,this is really great my family loves them theyre great with or without the frosting maybe ill add raisens next time and skip the frosting the only thing that really needs to change on this recipe is the amount of frostingway too muchill cut the amount in half next time
5,just made these yesterday my daughter and i ate one right out of the oven and they tasted like a slice of pumpkin pie i did add the frosting and cut it in half per peoples suggestion and it was perfect they made exactly cupcakes i used my pampered chef cookie scoop medium one and it worked really well because the batter is kind ofpuffy or frothy sooo yummy my hubby thought the frosting was a little too overpowering he couldnt tell they were pumpkin cupcakes till i told him but still loved them
5,this was by far the best cupcake i have ever made it turned out absolutely perfect and the cinnamon in the frosting was an excellent touch i made them for my sons birthday and they were a huge hit
5,loved this recipe i used fresh pumpkin that i cooked i added chocolate chips which my husband loved
5,this is excellent and super easy to make if you do make a double batch ie cupcakes dont bother doubling the icing there is way too much left over as it is
5,i made these cupcakes as one of four selections for my daughters wedding and now everyone is asking for the recipe i got more compliments on this recipe than any of the others flavors they really are super delicious and i am not really a fan of pumpkin i did use my own cream cheese frosting recipe though i will definetly make again and again
5,this recipe is delicious everyone in the office loved them i made everything per the directions except for the icing i didnt want an overwhelming cinnamon flavor so i only used tsp of cinnamon and it came out perfectly im very pleased with the recipe and yes i also had extra batter and icing i just used a round and made a small cake
5,these are great and very delicious i used only cups of sugar in the frosting and it was not too sweet but just right i made thse for my husbands potluck for work and got an amazing cupcakes from this recipe awesome i will make these again for thanksgiving instead of my pumpkin roll
5,very moist and not overly sweet
5,this recipe came with my very first taste of home magazine i had looked and looked at that cake and thought to myself that that cake couldnt tastes as good as it looked oh mother of pearl i was wrong over the top it is i didnt think my husband would eat it because he cant stand coffee and it has coffee in it but i was wrong this is the only chocolate cake they ever ask for suits me it is out of this world fantastic i have made it over and over again it is soooooo wonderful thanks for this recipe
5,awesome cake this is my most requested cake recipe especially for birthdays
5,can someone please tell me if the sugar used in the icing is granulated or powdered ive never heard of granulated for icing unless cooked but it doesnt specify
5,loved this cake this is my new chocolate cakevery moist very good i was a little worried when it was baking because it formed a wet ring and kind of looked like a doughnut but turned out just fine when done i didnt use this icing recipe i used a homemade peanut butter icing instead
5,this cake is so yummy and moist its the best chocolate cake ive ever made
5,ever since i got the magazine in the mail with this recipe in it this has been my chocolate cake recipe it is the best the frosting is different but a very good different ive been using this recipe for nearly years i do not use the coffee however i use water in place of the coffee oh and never use sour milk for the milk it really rose that time what a mess if you forget the sugar you can add it at the end ask me how i know the only time this cake was not the right cake was when i was using a special shape cake pan scooby doo and this cake was too moist for the pan
5,i read other reviews after i wrote my own two people asked about the unusual icing recipe the answers are yes it uses flour and it uses granulated sugar it does take the minutes to beat the icing did you ever wonder how the filling in a commercial filled cookie or cake like oatmeal cream pies or devil dogs is made make this icing and you will see after i had made this cake with the icing i read a recipe for whoopie pies the filling for them is the same recipe as this icing just a different quantity i recommend you try the icing excellent so you know how much i like this recipe i just spent hours trying to find it on this website because i cant find the magazine with the recipe this is the chocolate cake
5,this is the only chocolate cake that i make and have been making it since it first appeared in it is the best
5,wow this was more than words can describe fantastic very mosit cake and the icing was super super good
5,this smells so good and taste so good
5,we love this cake i go back to this recipe quite a bit and the icing is so tasty if i had to choose between this and a buttercream id choose this one always not so sweet
5,i have made this cake countless times and it is absolutely the best chocolate cake ive ever had i have never made the icing i usually top it with cream cheese frosting this cake is at its best when you make it a day ahead in order to bring out its delicious moistness
5,this was the very first recipe i ever made from taste of home and ive lost count of how many times ive made it since ive tied many many chocolate cake recipes and none can compare to this one as a bonus its outrageously easy ive even baked this in heartshaped layers and decorated it with rolled fondant after icing of course and fondant roses for a valentines treat its texture is substantial enough to hold up to the fondantwe like this cake best chilled my husband and i call it whoopie pie cake as we are from maine and think that it really captures the flavor of those yummy maine treatspersonally i usually do bake it at as ive found that at it takes rather a lot longer than minutes but that may be my oven at any rate this is an absolute keeper recipe

5,i have made this cake ever since it came out in the cookbook back in about i love it it is failproof if you want it to fill a x full just do one and a half batches of the recipe after it cools slice off the extra it is the best part and then turn the cake out onto the cooling rack
5,this cake is spectacular the best chocolate cake weve ever eaten very moist with that cant get enough taste no on our list
5,the best meat loaf recipe the sauce for the top really makes it special i will make it again
5,i have made this several times and my wife and i love it recently my wife is on a special diet and has lost a lot of weight because of this diet she cannot use crackers or breadcrumbs her weight loss coach told her to use pork rindschicharones as a binder i used that and it did not affect the taste at all she also cannot use the topping so she has special ketchup that her coach told her to use
5,pabsolutely delcious and so easy to make i just made it this afternoon with my kids and it is a huge hit i used the vanilla frosting recipe from toh because i needed something simple for the kids to help me with thank you so much for sharingp
5,i made only the cake portion of this recipe and it is truly spectacular very moist and flavorful not one of those sickeningly sweet cakes i will be using this recipe again
5,this cake is fabulous very moist with lots of chocolate flavor the icing is really light and has a wonderful taste not overly sweet definitely a keeper recipetrish d
5,this cake is deliscous it melts in your mouth the icing is good but i doctored it a little after about minutes of beating i added cup of powdered sugar to sweeten
5,i have been making this cake for at least years my children now grown have never asked for any other for their birthdaysit was originally in the taste of home magazine
5,excellent recipe its just as moist as a box mix i made the cake with whole wheat flour and couldnt tell the difference
5,not a big fan of chocolate cake but this one always makes me go back for seconds
5,we make this cake for my daughters birthday on new year day because i didnt have a box mix this is the best chocolate cake we have ever had better then any box or bakery cake the frosting is perfect and not to sweet i made a double batch of frosting and used all of it on a two layer cake

5,this is the only chocolate cake recipe my family will allow me to use the best
5,this is basically the recipe ive used for many years minus the sage which i only like in cornbread dressing i like to soak the crackers in the milk until they are soft before adding to the meat you can also add chopped bell pepper for extra flavor the only meatloaf recipe ill ever use
5,never made a decent meatloaf which family didnt care for anyway found this recipe in taste of homes copycat favorites book bingo didnt change a thing and has now become a favorite i am feeling victorian
5,i have very very picky kids the oldest is they pretty much all live on pizza every day no kidding until i made this and made all of them at least try it guess what i am now making it at least once a week and all of them absolutely love it so ive been doubling everything and they eat every last bit of it at least by the next evening all kids and myself would like to thank you for this wonderful meatloaf its a huge hit in our home god bless
5,delicious next time though ill follow the advice of a previous review and add the worcestershire sauce to the meatloaf and skip the sauce my family only likes a little sauce on top and this recipe made way more than we needed instead ill just add a little ketchup to the top before cooking i used pounds of ground beef instead of pounds because thats how it was packaged and i didnt have a need to save a small amount it still turned out fantastic much better than using the meatloaf seasoning packet like ive always done before
5,i dont know how many meatloafs ive made over the years or how many different versions ive tried but this is my very favorite i make a couple of changes though i use pounds of ground beef or meatloaf mix thats good too otherwise it turns out too loose for our taste i grate the onion instead of chopping it that way its taste is distributed evenly throughout the loaf and finally instead of one freeform loaf in the middle of my x pyrex pan i make two that way theres more surface to be covered with the sauce and we just like it better that way leftovers make awesome sandwiches too thanks for sharing this great recipe michelle beran
5,i have five kids of varying ages and this is something they all love ive made it for guests before thinking it may be too simple for a company meal but everyone left raving about it all asked for the recipe this one is a definite winner
5,amazingly easy to prepare first i cook on auto pilot this means i end up with a modified recipe bu it turned out perfect and delicious plus i have never made meatloaf without tomato sauce i choose this recipe as i could not bare making my moms fabulous recipe today she was a wonderful cook its almost mothers day and i miss her every day i find healing though cooking and am even inspired by asking my year old dad to share his own cooking tips with me may will be a celebration by sharing with my family some of moms favorite dishes
5,we loved this meatloaf recipe great flavor and taught me how to make it moist while still holding together i threw some mushrooms on top and some cheddar cheese
5,loved this recipe to cut calories i didnt put any sauce on until the very end and only used a mixture of cup bbq sauce cup ketchup and a t of mustard still very moist used pork sausage and beef i didnt have sage in the house so i skipped that
5,i started making this recipe years ago when i was about years old my grandmother gifted me a taste of home recipe book and i found this recipe after i made it the first time it the first time for my parents and brother it was a hit now i make it for my husband and five daughters such a wonderful recipe and turns out delicious every time
5,i had never made a meatloaf before but decided to make one using this recipe with a couple small modifications i only used cup of milk i used panko bread crumbs instead of crackers and i baked it for minutes it came out absolutely fantastic
5,fabulous meatloaf the only tweaks i made was to add cup a steak sauce and cup brown sugar but i doubled the recipe made my top glaze from another cup a steak sauce and cup brown sugar
5,omg this recipe reminds me of my moms its so moist and seasoned so well i just finished the last bite thank you for this delicious ness
5,i think many of us take a recipe and addchange things to make it our own i have never had very good luck making meatloaf it was either way too dense or it would fall apart this recipe is absolutely fantastic i did however addchange a couple of things a while back i ordered tomato powder from the spice house i always forget that i have it but i saw it in the refrigerator keeps it from getting hard as a rock and figured id add it in to the ground beef i used about a tablespoon i suppose you could always use a couple of tablespoons of the double concentrated tomato paste that comes in a tube i also used mostly ground beef but figured id add some in for some extra moisture and obviously more fat my mom always used ritz crackers for meatloaf or meatballsso i combined ritz crackers and saltinesnot really sure it made a difference then i added about one or two teaspoons of kitchen bouquet to the mixture im not sure if my changes made any difference at all from the original recipe but this was absolutely the best meatloaf i have ever eaten my year old son asked me if it was any good and i told him to taste it and let me know he called from the kitchen and said dad this is the best meatloaf what the world did you put in this
5,yummy a simple and delicious meatloaf having fewer veggies in the recipe makes for a denser meatloaf so it makes it easier to cut into slices for sandwiches
5,i made a meatloaf for my sweeties sister she loves meatloaf him not so much i had some caramelized onions left over from something else and decided to put them in a small portion of the meatloaf mix for just him then i topped it with barbque sauce i lined the loaf pan with foil and made a separate section for his meatloaf by making a foil partition he loved it they will be getting both now she loved this recipe
5,i have never been a fan of meatloaf either but this recipe won me over the only change i made was omitting the sage the meatloaf came out moist and flavorful my kids loved it and the leftovers didnt last very long this is now my go to recipe when my husband requests meatloaf from now on
5,i love this meatloaf very flavorful and the leftovers are great as well this ones definitely a keeper
5,i got this from you magazine several years ago first of all it is delicious several homes ive brought it to love it at holiday time i am asked to bring it for our main recipe its just the best recipe you will ever have its also very easy to make you owe it to yourself and family and friends to try this one
5,its goooood
5,i learned this from my mom too the brown sugar is that secret ingredient that is the game changer i try to stay away from sugar but meat loaf without it is just meh
5,i tried this recipe without the milk onion and saltinesused italian bread crumbs for the saltinesa huge hit with my husband and i cant wait to make it again and tweak it a bit
5,im not a big fan of meatloaf but this was very good made it exact but will cut back on the milk next time great comfort meal thanks michelle
5,margycravathgmailcom great recipei added a touch of prepared mustard and a capsule apple cider vinegar to ketchup
5,this is always a hit my husband devours this meatloaf he even admitted that after all the years of loving his moms meatloaf he thinks this is even better
5,my husband and kids loved this meatloaf this recipe is a keeper
5,i have always loved meat loaf but didnt know how much till i tried this recipe it is now my go to meat loaf recipe love it
5,tried this recipe last year and we love it makes tasty sandwiches the next day too
5,ive been making this recipe for years and we love it i substitute plain bread crumbs for the saltines but it is great either way
5,switched milk with tomato sauce and it was amazingmy very picky family loves it and ask for it often
5,great meatloaf recipe the sage gives a special touch i love the sauce on the side to use as much as desired
5,doubled the recipe and made i did not make the sauce just used ketchup straight from the bottle there was none left and everyone loved it thanks for the recipe
5,i was never a meatloaf fan but i substitute ritz crackers and we love this recipe my year old son cried when i told him i was making meatloaf he ate helpings and now both him and his dad ask for this atleast once a week the sauce makes it perfect and its so simple definitely a staple in our house
5,wonderful meat loaf recipe the saltines milk and eggs make it super tender and the sage doesnt overpower at alljust adds a nice earthy warmth to it the sauce was a bit too sweet for us so next time ill cut back on the brown sugar but this is a great meatloaf and something ill definitely make againvolunteer field editor
5,very good recipe my go to i read all the comments and altered it like thisi used ground so i doubled the cracker to cups ritz and i used cup cream instead of milk to help make it firmer its important to let the meatloaf rest minutes before servingi also altered the topping adding prepared mustard using less ketchup and adding less brown sugarcame out great
5,made this last night omg it is the best i must say i did make some changes but my hubby has always liked my usual meatloaf but he loves this one i replaced the milk with a can of golden mushroom soup packet of lipton onion soup deleted the sage not big sage fans the amount of cracker crumbs had to increased i used almost a full sleeve of crackers and probably could have been ok with the whole sleeve it is a winner in our book
5,i made this meatloaf today and it turned out awesome i used chicken stock instead of milk and added more saltine crackers i used a whole sleeve at the end of minutes i turned the oven off opened the oven door and let it sit there for another hour meatloaf was juicy and delicious i also used less brown sugar in the recipe
5,this is my favorite recipe but instead of the crackers ill use bread crumbs
5,we love this recipe so much that we had it for a christmas party it was a big hit reqested recipe
5,the best meatloaf i have ever had
5,i have made this a few times although i always halve the recipe as there are only two of us eating it it is a very nice meatloaf being easy to make and very tasty today i used the ground veal that i got on sale at the store and it was just as tasty as the ground beef i think you would use whatever ground meat you have on hand
5,i have made this many times we love it i cut the salt to tsp or omit altogether i use bread crumbs in place of crackers i shape it to fit my crockpot place it on aluminum foil with holes poked in it to release the fat put it on a rack or a couple of jar covers sidebyside and cook it on low for hours pour the sauce on the top of the loaf for the last minutes this is delicious
5,absolutely yummy this is a keeper
5,botanner then tweek the recipe to cut down the salt
5,this is a test comment
5,this is a great recipei no longer use any other i substitute panko for saltines and since my family doesnt love sage in beef i substitute granulated garlic
5,years of proofbeing a working mom i was looking for a meatloaf my whole family would lovei made different meatloafs one day and had the family try all hands down this was there favorite my kids come home and still want this over almost anything else i make one of there favorite foods and warm family memories go with this meal i now make this for my grandkids and for the stubborn eaters i now put chopped or mashed veggies in i cover with part of sauce not real heavy then put the rest in a bowl warm for those who like more try with your family and you will have a new easy family favorite
5,i have made this hundreds of times everyone raves about it i have modified it sometimes sometimes i add celery i often use hamburg and lean ground pork i put chopped green peppers in occasionally and used it to stuff green peppers i think is the sauce that people really like
5,this meat loaf is moist and flavorful another keeper
5,very good and simple recipe its a go to at our house husband loves making meatloaf sandwiches the next day been making this for years and everyone always raves about it we love the sauce
5,love this recipe i cook it in the crock pot i have substituted venison for the ground beef

5,these are amazing a hit at my work for our potluck but one questionhave made these a few times but never have been able to peak the frosting is the picture with canned frosting anyone else have this problemeither way the frosting is still amazing its just spread on there
5,i have made these twice and they are a huge hit easy to make and delicious they will make your kitchen smell yummy
5,i made these for a party i was hosting on a chilly fall evening and they were fantastic and a huge hit they turned out very moist and the flavor was wonderful i cut the frosting recipe in half and am glad i did because this was plenty i tried them with and without the frosting and liked them both ways the frosting is not necessary but really does make them just a little more special they went well with the spiced hot apple cider i served and i will make these again
5,made these for a get together yesterday they were fabulous however sledchick my frosting was spreadable i couldnt get it to peak either but still very delicious
5,i would suggest trying a piping bag with a star tip if it seems too soft put in freezer for a few mins to harden it some and that may help hope this works for you
5,these cupcakes were so easy and delicious perfect for fall
5,these cupcakes were a great hit got the recipe from my friends son when he posted it on his facebook page enjoygoing to make them again this year
5,these cupcakes are great made these last year for the st time they were a bit hit will make them again this year enjoy
5,awesome
5,i used a different frosting but the cupcakes are very moist and tasty
5,this was delicious even though the frosting was a little liquidy it still had a great flavor the cupcake itself was great well definitely make this again
5,yummy moist tasty cupcakes i made batchesone for us some to freeze and one for the potluck at church today everyone loved them and complemented on the spicy flavor and tasty cinnamon frosting i just spread the frosting on top it firms up after sitting for awhile so good ill make them again and again
5,awesome we really liked this meatloaf recipe i rarely make meatloaf but this recipe might change that
5,this is my favorite meat loaf recipe
5,love it ive tried several different meatloaf recipes my husband loves meatloaf and this is the one my husband thinks is the absolute best ive never been much of a meatloaf fan and even i truly enjoy it the only change i made was to reduce everything by a third since there are only two of us and we still have leftovers for the next days lunch at least he does
5,made this for the first last week and have cooked it four times by special requests from familythey all love iti use pounds of ground beef and increased other ingredients accordingly since my family does not like catsup i use sweet baby ray original saucethis meatloaf is gourmet i also substitute saltines in favor of club or ritz crackers instead of bulb onion i used about green onions including the green parts this meatloaf has lots of flavor
5,excellent i made this exactly per the recipe and will be making again for sure served oven crispy potatoes
5,this is delicious we have made it several times and i doubt we will ever stop
5,i was never a meatloaf fan but reluctantly agreed to make it for my husband after constant requests i used this recipie and now i love meatloaf i make it all the time and no matter who is eating they all go back to seconds and there are no leftovers
5,i have made this for many years it is my familys favorite love the sauce on top and having leftovers for sandwichesthough i have to make to have leftovers i used ritz crackers instead of the saltines this time and loved it just as much
5,this was really good my husband was never a huge meatloaf fan but he also gave this stars i only put in half the brown sugar that the recipe called for because im trying to cut down on sugar and there were a number of reviews saying the sauce was pretty sweet with half the sugar it still seemed pretty sweet to me next time i will put in a quarter of the sugar that the recipe calls for
5,i have made this in my crockpot for years best meatloaf recipe ever i never liked meatloaf before trying this recipe
5,great
5,meatloaf is a family favorite and this is a good one i usually mix a pound of ground pork with pound of ground beef in my meatloaf served with some mashed potatoes this is comfort food at its best
5,this stuff is dope i almost never eat ground beef but was looking for something different to make for dinner seriously delicious made the recipe exactly as written used the extra sauce too and loved it great combination of savoury and sweet reminiscent of good southern bbq would gladly make again very soon thanks for this scrumptious dish
5,im a single dad who like many people im raising my child on my own ill be the first to admit that my cooking skills would make chef boyardee and martha stewart blush in shame however last night i tried this meatloaf and man you should have seen the look on my kids face after her first bite it was worth the time and effort what topped it off she asked for thirds thank you
5,i had never made meatloaf before and have never cared much for it either but my husband asked for it one night this recipe was super easy to make and tasted delicious my husband loved it and i did too he especially liked the sauce i used breadcrumbs in place of crushed saltines i would highly recommend this recipe
5,this was very good but a little too soft for my taste i think next time ill use less and see if that might firm it up
5,if i had ground beef in the house right now i would make this for dinner its freezing cold here in los angeles california and this sounds like it would warm our hearts gt perhaps im on my way to the market yep my husband had a dr apt and took me to grocer its in the oven right now made exactly as written ill report backdeeeeeeeelishsgwing gt use less whatkittiekatt gt all due respect to you as well my mil without fail always used crushed saltines for her meatloaf and meatballs they were always exactly the same and of my favorite meals she made our kids well they adored it and her
5,my family loves this recipe i do not use the sage i add a little ketchup to the meat mixture just cause i like a little tomatoy inside the loaf i sometimes poke holes on the loaf so the topping can seep into the loaf
5,best i have ever had
5,i made this with ground beef and skim milk my husband liked the sauce and also said it was moist and tender but held together nicely he still prefers his moms meatloaf recipe
5,this is baking in my oven right now on a rainy cool sunday afternoon i have made this meatloaf many times beforeand i think the sage gives this meatloaf the unique flavor it smells so good baking i do use reduced sodium crackers worcestershire and catsup as a rule in cooking it is moist and flavorful served with yams and roasted carrots of many colors this meal is a winner in our home thanks for sharing michelle
5,i love it but some times i use italian bread crumbs instead of saltines

5,this is my familys favorite meatloaf recipe i have been making it for over years if i try a different recipe they know it i believe the sauce is what makes it so good
5,i have been making a recipe almost exactly like this for years the only difference is that i use quick rolled oats instead of saltine crackers and omit the sage although i will try sage next time just to see if the family likes that spice in the meatloaf thanks for sharing our mothers before us knew what satisfied at the dinner table thats why recipes like this are still around albeit with slight differences
5,yummy i added of ground sausage everyone raved im not usually a fan of this but it was the best ive had

5,i always cut the topping down by half because ive found it to be more than enough to cover the meatloaf and still leave some extra for a topping after it cooksalso since i usually dont have sage handy i substitute tsp thyme tsp oregano and a few pinches of dried parsleyoh and the more onion the better

5,my this meatloaf is one my whole family loves i made some gravy from the pan drippings for the mashed potatoes yummy
5,yum yum yummy will make again i also didnt have an onion on hand so we used dried minced onions that you get off the spice aislethe conversions were on our bottle great to make if you have are running low on ingredients to make most other ground beef recipes d
5,excellent just the right size for two people
5,delicious recipe cooling and light if you had a dry cake more than likely it was beating the egg whites too long which gives a dry product thanks for this keeper
5,here in the south this little gem is known as a pig pickin cake if youre super health conscious you can certainly make it according to this recipe but we like it a tiny bit more indulgent in my house we use the whole eggs indicated on the cake mix canola oil instead of applesauce for the cake itself and regular pudding mix and whipped topping for the frosting we also add coconut and orange extract to the frosting mixture its delicious and a hit every time
5,my husbands uncle wally introduced us to pig pickin cake over years ago he explained that its called a pig pickin cake because it was the traditional dish brought to a pig picking in his neck of north carolina a pig picking being a neighborhood event that follows a pig roasting after the pig is roasted the women get together to pick and shred the meat from the carcass for the making of traditional carolina bbq our familys version includes a golden butter cake mix box c oil the fruit from acan of mandarins and t of the juice and whole eggs the frosting is can of crushed pineapple not drained with box instant vanilla pudding mixed in after about mins fold the whipped topping oz into the puddingpineapple i have made this as a sheet cake layer cake cupcakes or in a springform cut into layers always delicious and one of my very favorite desserts thanks uncle wally miss you
5,i have been making this recipe for years it is my mother in laws recipe and one of my favorites she calls it orange pineapple sunshine cake and one of my good friends calls it pig lickin good cake it is so good and very easy to make also you can keep the ingredients on hand for a quick dessert to take to a potluck or just for company
5,this was a wonderful cake i say was since it didnt last the weekend i split the cake batter into two round inch springform pans and used a oz can of mandarin oranges all the store had at the time and it produced a moist cake that was light but paired well with the frosting i had enough frosting left over my household prefers a lightly frosted cake to do a five cup salad variation for dessert as well will make this again and again
5,great recipe my picky eaters ate it all up
5,pi had prepared this meatloaf when it first was featured in taste of home i did make the following adjustments i used italian bread crumbs onion chopped tsp italian seasoning tsp pepper and cup of barbecue sauce at that time since i didnt have the ingredients to make regular bbq sauce id used a meatloaf pan to bake this meatloafppi would probably omit the brown sugar in this sauce if i choose to use prepared bbq sauce and id probably omit the worcestershire sauce since bbq sauce has all the additions in it already as i recall this meatloaf was really good thank you for sharing it with taste of home delowensteinp
5,simple moist tasty meatloaf also recommend meat mixture for italian meatballs dott
5,this recipe has been a hit in our home since publication the only change i have made is we omit the sage
5,i love this recipe in fact i have shared this with many of my family members who rave about it too my youngest son who is requests this one oftenlara
5,i started making this recipe when it was first published in toh and my family loves it they will not let me make meatloaf with any other recipe
5,its the topping that for me really makes this recipe i use it all the time even on top of other meatloaf recipes much better than ketchup

5,my husband loves it me too
5,this is one of my families favorite cakes moist delicious and refreshing
5,my family loved this dessert i have now made it several times by special request my only advice to be sure to fold the whipped topping the first time i didnt pay close attention and used a mix master came out runny but still tasted great thanks for sharing this new favorite for our family
5,i made this cake for the first time this week and its so delicious and refreshing the topping is almost like a creamy fruit salad i too made a nonreduced version id rather have a small piece of the real deal than a bigger piece of artificial sweeteners fat free whatever etc so the changes i made upon reading the reviews were to the cake i added a tsp of orange extract used three whole eggs as called for on the cake mix box instead of egg whites and used canola oil instead of applesauceto the topping i used regular instant pudding and regular frozen whipped topping
5,my mother in law introduce the original version of this cake to me in and i have loved it every since i tasted it i am only going to rate the original because i havent tried the non reduce version yet
5,i made this cake for a memorial day party i made the fullfat version and added more orange juice to the batter to bump up the orange flavor i also made it with a golden butter cake mix as that was all i had in the pantry for decoration i put tons of red white and blue sprinkles on top it looked really festive and the kids went crazy for it the hostess put out all the desserts and no lie everyone pointed to my cake for a piece the taste was buttery and flavorful with all the fruit in it the pudding made the whipped topping silky and delicious this recipe is a keeper
5,i wanted to make this cake for a long time however i cant eat gluten so i was dragging my feet pilsbury recently came out with a gluten free yellow cake mix that is made in a x pan so i figured i would give it a try first of all let me say that the cake baked up fabulously in fact i followed the cake recipe only changing to a gluten free cake mix i did make the frosting with a oz size whipped cream i had some left over and and figured why not this cake was so moist and delicious even better the second day if you need to eat gluten free go ahead and make this cake i know i will make this cake again and again next time i think i will put some maraschino cherries on top
5,this cake is alway a big hit and so easy to make best of all it is semi healthywe love it and i am always giving out the recipe has such wonderful flavor it is hard to have just one piece
5,i have been making this cake for about yrs and i know it as the pineapple dream cake i bake it in round layers and have always drained the crushed pineapple for the icing it has always been a big favorite of my family amp friends and since moving to sc it has become a favorite of my neighbors love it
5,soundz so delish it
5,made this cake yesterday and its half gone already just two people eating followed recipe and it came out perfect i am curious as to why the name change from pig picking cake to pineapple orange cake i sense a bit of pcness going on as for the review from momof re pudding size i used the oz box called for so i dont know where the claim of typo error comes from anyway follow the recipe and youll have a wonderful dessert

5,i made this over the weekend nice light dessert ill definitely make it again thanks for sharinglinda lu
5,ive had this recipe for a while but didnt make them until this year boy did i regret that these were the best cupcakes ive ever made my boyfriend wont let me share them with anybody i brought them to work and everyone wanted the recipe ill be making these every year for the rest of my life more than likely
5,this recipe was yumo loved the cinnamon spice in it gave some to the fire house and they loved them toowill make them again
5,worth the worki used homemade pumpkin puree cup instead of the canned pumpkin made my own pumpkin pie spice and used soured milk instead of the buttermilki think the recipe needed a little less liquid on the day i made it but i went against my better judgement and used all the recipe called for thus the cupcakes didnt set fast enough in the oven and had hat brims of batter that cooked over the top of the liners instead of rising in a nice domei also made half of the frosting as suggested by previous reviewers and it covered all not as the recipe claims cupcakes nicely the frosting tasted very good despite the fact that it calls for what i think is a lot of cinnamonas to why frosting might not be setting up as mentioned by alie if you make cream cheese frosting with lowfat neufchatel cheese or fatfree cream cheese it doesnt have the fat required to whip up and set the frosting soupy cream cheese frosting can be fixed by using only fullfat or regular cream cheese remember the cream cheese is replacing butter in quick buttercream frosting to make cream cheese frosting
5,great cupcakes i cut the frosting in half as suggested by other users but ran out with cupcakes left i decorated the cupcakes exactly as pictured i would suggest making a full batch of the frosting and freezing any leftovers for future baking projects it is delicious
5,yummy and so cute
5,i simply loved these cupcakes delicious and very easy the one thing i did to improve them was add tablespoons of grade a maple syrup to the frostings to kick up the fall flavors also to anyone having trouble with to runny frosting your butter or cream cheese was to soft
5,i thought this recipe was great i put hersheys cinnamon and premier white chips in them as well and they turned out great
5,followed this recipe exactly and they are amazing
5,i buy a small container of buttermilk use what i need and freeze the rest in cup increments in labeled freezer bagslay them flat til they freeze then you can stand them up for easier storage
5,the best dessert ive ever had they are mouth watering and you cant just have one
5,wow these are amazing i used c applesauce and cup butter as opposed to c butter they are so moist and flavorful thanks for sharing
5,terrific recipe think they are even better the next day without the frosting they make a wonderful muffin
5,i made these for a teachers luncheon and kept a dozen for my family i havent heard anything back yet from the teachers or pta but the ones in my house were gone within days they are moist and taste like pumpkin pie in a wrapper i am making again today to take to a friend who just had a baby and we will keep the rest yum
5,this is a fabulous recipe my friend wanted a good seasonal cupcake recipe after she volunteered to bake desserts for another friends november baby shower i volunteered to help and after baking a test batch we made just a couple of alterations for the pumpkin spice we used fresh ground cloves and nutmeg about a tablespoon and a half total of approximately equal parts nutmeg and clove and we increased the cinnamon by a half teaspoonfor my palate id add even more spice in the future likely the nutmeg and clove but generally the spice level seems good for most people i decreased the amount of sugar in the frosting by a half cup and might even reduce it by a full cup in the future along with adding about cup more cream cheese we also added about to of a vanilla bean split the bean and scrape out along with the cinnamon which made it a really rich tasting frostingif you have a pastry bag with decorative frosting tips you can frost them that way and the cupcakes look professionally made nice to take to parties and holiday events to top them off we sprinkled finely chopped candied ginger on top of the finished frosting
5,i dont usually bake but stumbled across this recipe while searching for a pumpkin dessert i live at k feet so cakes are a real challenge this is delicious and easy i followed it and added half a walnut to the tops it made exactly perfect cupcakes and the frosting was the right amount i took them for dessert to a gathering and they were a huge hit
5,this recipe has been a family favorite ever since it first appeared in taste of home in now that its just the two of us i bake it in two xinch pans and freeze one to enjoy at a later date or share with a friend

5,i found this recipe when i ordered my first taste of home recipe file it is easy filling and we love the taste this has been a family favorite for years it is just now just my husband and i now and i have found to with freeze well in foil baking dishes
5,tasty hearty fillingdifferent enough to not seem like any other pasta dish dont have veggie vans then cut things small and they really wont notice like the idea to next time add pepperoni probably will double the parmesan on top
5,i will definitely make this i like every single ingredient in this so i fail to see why i wouldnt like it
5,a nice change from the usual spaghetti dinner i had fresh mushrooms that needed to be used so i chopped them up and put them in the onion and pepper saute my family really likes cheese so i doubled the amount of parmesan on the top this will definitely go into the recipe rotation
5,this is one of my favorite recipes i prefer to use white cake though
5,loved it used red peppers since i had no green ones and also left out black olives would be great for a pot luck or just feeding a group of friends keeper
5,this recipe is very good with just a few additions add salt amp pepper to taste to the ground beef then add garlic to taste add cup of water to the mushroom soup that you pour over the top layer and then cover the top layer with shredded mozzarella cheese along with the parmesan i also added fresh cooked mushrooms to the meatdiced tomato mix now you go from good to great this version is tastier and more moist than original

5,this is my favorite recipe that i ever found in toh magazine i made it all the time when my kids were growing up however the original recipe called for whole not diced tomatoes i dont know why they changed it ive made it both ways and prefer it the way the recipe was originally written i add a little granulated garlic and i also use fresh mushrooms and saute them over medhigh heat until they get a little color ground turkey works great too love love love this recipe
5,fabulous easy recipe and i gave it stars because i copied amp printed about ten of the reviews with variations on the theme incredibly useful for the basic recipe and variations to suit my mood or the spices and meats i have on hand
5,i fixed this last night for supper and it was absolutely delicious i would have never thought that cream of mushroom soup on top of baked spaghetti would be good it was a big hit at my house
5,one of my familys favorite recipes i like to use spicy sausage in place of the ground beef it adds lots of flavor our guests always want the recipe
5,this is virtually identical to the chicken spaghetti recipe ive been making for the past years chicken instead of ground beef and green stuffed olives instead of black olives its very good either way its been a staple at big family dinners for decades
5,this was a big hit with my family since we dont like mushrooms i substituted cream of celery soup for the cream of mushroom soup and added pepperoni it was absolutely delightful

5,easy to make moist and delicious
5,this disappeared at our family christmas dinner easy to make i cheated and used whipped cream cheese frosting though and very tasty they dont puff up a lot so fill the cups full the cake is fairly heavy but a good consistency i will definitely be making these again
5,excellent flavor and really easy i was able to substitute greek yogurt for the buttermilk and my cupcakes were great and perfectly moist i was also able to do it without an electric mixer so thats a plus
5,i love this recipe but i didnt actually go ingredient by ingredient i accidentally forgot to add the canned pumpkin lol i was ready to throw the batch out but to my surprise the cupcakes were very tasty i even added a crumb topping to some i did add a bit more buttermilk cinnamon and pumpkin spice to my batch i also omitted the ginger i will be making this again and hopefully this time i will not forget the pumpkin
5,these cupcakes are amazing the only thing i changed was reducing the sugar to cups i thought would be a little too sweet for my taste and i think i was right cause they turned out perfectly sweet i cant say enough about how good these are the spices are spot on and i love that it calls for butter i wont use vegetable oil or shortening yum

5,we loved this i really liked the addition of the cream of mushroom soup my dh who hates anything that contains cream of anything soup even loved it
5,love this cornbread followed recipe added just a little more milk because i thought the batter was a bit thick
5,love this cornbread best recipe ive found been using it for awhile
5,the buttery flavor and soft crumb is wonderful i always cut the sugar by half or more since my diet cant tolerate all of that but give this a try
5,this is delicious corn bread i dont care what you want to call it thanks nicole
5,i like this recipe easy to make and tasty i made a few changes used pamalas gluten free baking flour instead of sugar i used ½ cup monk fruit sweetener and cut the butter to ½ cup it baked up really nice i think i will put some corn kernels in next time
5,best corn bread ever love the simple ingredient list we like them as muffins
5,i just made this and had a small piece of it and it is very good it came out a little bit drybut that could be my faultas i have never made any kind of corn breadand had it in the oven a little longerbecause my toothpick came out wet will i make this again absolutely i also creamed the butter sugar for exactly minutes until it was a nice pale yellow color
5,i loved the sweetness of this cornbread and it was great fresh right out of the oven we ate ours with butter and syrup just like when i was a kid
5,have now made this cornbread recipe at least times over the past couple years it is an absolute handsdown favorite of my family and some lucky friends when i serve it with any kind of soup especially my kielbasa and kale soup deelish
5,ive tried so many corn bread recipes out there and this one is the best one by far im so happy i found this recipe if you have a few extra minutes this recipe is worth making
5,i got this recipe out of the taste of home magazine probably more than years ago and it is still a favorite of mine and my family i always get requests for the recipe i make it all the time for new mothers and when i take food for the families when someone passes away because it is easy and everyone loves it i keep the olives out and the kids love it too
5,i also have been making this recipe since my daughter now grown makes this for her familyher kids now ask her to make it
5,i made this for the first time when i had company over and everyone loved it this is a great recipe thanks for sharing
5,this is one of only a few recipes that i repeat constantly my husband loves it and will take leftovers to his buddies for lunch
5,delicious recipe was given to me by a lady i work with and she got it from taste of home
5,excellent recipe to all the southerner commentors get over yourselves it is a matter of taste
5,very good flavor and texture easy to make nice sweet flavor will make again
5,great basic recipe im having mine with super spicy chili thank you
5,first time having cornbread and i loved it recipe was very easy to follow i did reduce the sugar to tbsp as i was serving it with stew this scottish girl loved the finished result
5,corn bread is like pizza theres no right or wrong
5,the best cornbread recipe ive ever had i made several copies so i can always find it easily
5,this definitely is yummy but i do have to say it will be named corncake with a slash in my recipe file i do wonder if people saying cornbread from the south is dry is because of in the north they rarely use real good olebacon grease and real buttermilk so this is most southerners that i grew up with counted on eating a slice from a castiron skillet the best way to stay moist and have a crispy crust
5,very good and sweet cornbread perfect with spicy main dishes
5,my family is a huge fan of cornbread
5,i thought this was excellent i live in the deep south and cannot understand the love for the dry unsweet variety that is so prevalent here they dont call this southern cornbread so the folks who are up in arms about this not being real southern cornbread should back off must be my northern roots but this is some of the best cornbread ive had and it makes a nice large pan of it too warms up great i found it sweet yes but not excessively so
5,great recipe and my whole family loved it
5,thank you nicole for sharing what looks like a yummy recipe i am looking forward to making exactly like your recipe stated
5,okso i thought this was very good and im from virginia ive decided that i dont like cornbread at all but love corn cake instead we all have different tastes and ive found as ive gotten older that food i thought was good as a kid really wasnt that great
5,very good i switch between this recipe
5,just made this recipe this morning exactly as written i cut the recipe in half and made large muffins as someone else had done as its just of us baked for minutes and they came out great yummy
5,excellent as is
5,absolutely wonderful flavor i added a small handful of chopped pickled jalapenos and some cheddar cheese for a little kick will definitely be making this one again
5,made this recipe with two changesi used cup of sugar and cooked it in an iron skillet according to my husband it was the best cornbread he had ever eaten so moist and delicious this will be my go to recipe from now on
5,we all loved it it had a wonderful flavor and great consistency very moist i used a very coarse corn meal which i think ill get a finer one next time but thats a small thing it just made it a bit gritter than i would have liked didnt affect the flavor at all
5,my significant other is in a marine corps league he is in charge of their annual fundraiser which is a ham amp bean amp cornbread supper four years ago we started making the cornbread for this event since we were to be serving masses i searched for a traditional recipe that would make more than an x pan i came across this and we got great reviews the event has grown and several people have requested that we use the same recipe i have not heard a single complaint i just finished making x pans and by the way it freezes well
5,i made this recipe gluten free the other night and it was very good even my wheateating husband said it was quite good and had several pieces im making it again tonight yes the texture is much lighter and fluffier than traditional cornbread but for someone allergic to wheat it was really nice to get a soft light bread that i can eatif anyone is interested i converted it by using my usual glutenfree flour and increasing the egg and baking powder a bit i did cut it to a quarterrecipe for the two of us and i baked it in a terra cotta bread dish which gave it a nice crispy outside with a light soft inside and as my husband noted kept it warm at the table too i used tbsp softened butter cup sugar large egg egg white cup plus tbsp milk cup plus tbsp glutenfree flour cup cornmeal tsp baking powder tsp salt
5,love this recipe its the best cornbread i have had its better than the one they sell at whole foods most of the cornbreads i have had are dry this won is kind of sweet and you can cut down on the sugar i also used skim milk
5,great sweet corn bread recipe ive made it twice sticking to original recipe it does make a large amount so i froze a few pieces in freezer bags and used them during the rest of the week you can defrost them or they reheat well in the microwave just a minute or less for a couple of pieces this recipe is very much like the krusteaz honey cornbread mix i usually buy if you like sweet cornbread youll definitely want to try this
5,so good try it
5,this is the best cornbread ever i am a northerner but my husband is not and he says it cant be beat i do substitute buttermilk for the milk but that is the only change i make like others have said it is very moist and does freeze well and if you have never had it with syrup give it a try you might like it
5,excellent very moist my husband tried it and said i think i like cornbread now many recipes are too dry but not this one
5,so not the healthiest corn bread recipe but its so goodthis is my go to corn bread now i have reduced the sugar to cup a few times it was still fine
5,i normally eat healthy but every once in a while i will treat myself to some good ole fashion home cooking this cornbread recipe i awesome i made a pot of greens usin this cornbread recipe and felt like was eating corncread cake yummmmmyyyyyy
5,made this as muffins will put some in the freezer to see how they do
5,this is sooo good its perfectly light and fluffy its the best cornbread ive made its really not a cake as some said as cakes have equal parts sugar and flour ie c sugar to c flour comforting on a cold drizzling winter day
5,as a new bride i made corn bread amp then asked myself why it was dry amp tasteless so over the years i tried others amp didnt change my mind when i saw this in toh in amp tried it it was just what i was looking for so have used it for years my children amp grandchildren love it as well as others when i take it to potlucks i dont change anything
5,great cornbread moist buttery sweet some southerners think they own the making of good cornbread but they dont theres nothing wrong with sweet cornbread ive had cornbread with no sugar baked in a skillet with bacon fat and its nothing to brag about this recipe is now my go to recipe when im making cornbread two thumbs up add some jam and ill fight ya for it
5,very good moist not overly sweet light made recipe and put into muffin cupcake paper cups only baked for min i will be making this again i will not be using the recipe on the cornmeal package ever again
5,a good recipe bakes up light and fluffy but the next time i make it i will decrease the sugar by half sweet so depending on how you use it or what you pair it with may determine how sweet you like it
5,definite make again i made only half the batter since there were only of us eating it i made large muffins and baked about minutes they were so tender and slightly sweet yum
5,this is the most delicious cornbread i have ever ate this cornbread stays moist and is awesome with anything mmmmm good
5,great cornbread recipe its a keeper
5,made as directed and was very good
5,yum i cut back a little on the sugar and it was still plenty sweet
5,i dont normally make comments but these cupcakes were so good that i had to the flavors all blend together well and the cupcakes are super moist i am not a huge fan of pumpkin but i loved these these are great cupcakes for thanksgiving
5,made these today and they are wonderful they are moist and very flavorful frosting taste great with the cinnamon added will definitely make again
5,i was told by several people at my husbands work that these were the best cupcakes they have ever eaten in their life very moist but yet stay together and dont fall apart the icing was definitely a winner as well
5,moist and delicious just as good as all the great reviews stated i will definitely be keeping this one
5,everyone absolutely loved them and begged me for the recipe i made according to recipe as written
5,i have been making these for years an they are always the talk of the party the only thing that i do different is use one big can of oz of pumpkin instead of oz and it just makes it so much more moist and more pie like
5,these are delicious very moist amp the icing made themthese are the best pumpkin cupcakes ever
5,very moist and tastey the frosting was delicious and the added cinnamon topped it off my boyfriend who is not even a big sweets person ate them days in a row and my kids loved them even better the next day
5,after i submitted my review i saw it was for the pumpkin cupcakes and not the pumpkin cookies so sorry i did make these cupcakes also and they are scrumptious
5,delicious ive made these several times and have taken to work everyone raves about them and comes looking for more my children also love them people who dont like pumpkin have tried them and say they are awesome
5,awesome taste my family loved these i had enough left over to make a small pumpkin loaf next time i am going to make this as loaves instead of cupcakes
5,the cupcakes and icing turned out great i doubled the recipe but instead of using cups of sugar for the cupcakes i only used it came out perfectly sweet with the cups
5,my daughter won her cooking competition with these they taste fantastic highly reccomend

5,very tasty i made this to accompany a large batch of chili for casual gathering they gobbled it up and asked for the recipe i served it with honey on the sideyum i think it was enjoyed so much because it is a bit different than the typical corn bread i did decrease the sugar to cup as suggested by others but that was the only recipe change

5,this message is for the lady whos family does not like mayo or some of the other ingredients and is worried how the sour cream looked in the finished cake you will in no way taste those ingredients in the finished cake they are used for volume moisture and texture this cake should taste wonderful this recipe is quite similar to how a red velvet cake would be made i have an award winning chocolate cake recipe from good housekeeping magazine that used vinegar for the rising agent and you would never in a million years believe that the cakes is made with vinegar try the recipe your family will love this cake
5,this is the most amazing cake have made it several timesno wonder its an award winner

5,i made this gluten and dairy free by substituting a gluten free all purpose blend flour and adding xanthan gum used dairy free sour cream and earth balance stick butter also substituted german chocolate for the semisweet the cakes were very moist and stuck to the cooling racks a bit but overall it worked just fine my dairyallergic son said he was surprised at how good it was being gluten free it was his birthday cake and was unsure at first about having it gf but he had pieces
5,excellent chocolate cake light tender layers with the right taste of chocolate easy to make in inch layers or cut recipe in half and make inch layers thank you sandy
5,this is the best chocolate cake ever i dont have room in my oven for three pans so i bought a pair of fat daddio pans that are deep i use a very light coating of wiltons cake release and wrap my pans to keep the layers evenly baked i split the full recipe between the two pans and baked them at for minutes perfect layers i like the icing recipe on the back of the hersheys cocoa powder container it spreads beautifully and stays soft and creamy for the life of the cake you can even pipe decorations with it this cake never fails to please

5,the best cake will make again
5,this is my newest favorite cake delicious i did make x the frosting so i could really load up the entire cake with extra frosting yum
5,i didnt want to make a layer cake so i cut the recipe in half and baked it in a x pyrex pan for about minutes and it turned out perfectly the cake is very good the frosting was creamy and thick but perhaps just a little bit too sweet but overall a greattasting cake
5,i recently took this cake to a dinner with friends it got rave reviews as it was pretty and very moist the frosting was good but not icky sweet will keep this one for sure
5,best chocolate cake ever printed it and taped it inside my kitchen cupboard

5,this recipe was amazing i used a separate recipe for the frosting because i wanted a lighter color but the cake itself was very moist and delicious
5,this was a very good cake i halved the recipe and baked it in rounds since there is only two of us and i dont want cake hanging around too long it came out perfect i had never heard of making frosting with sour cream it was delicious not sweet like most this will now be my only chocolate frosting i use thanks for the recipe

5,i just want to say that shirley and vsailaway are wrong this recipe is hands down the best chocolate cake recipe ive ever used the three cups brown sugar is not too much for a cake of this volume my cake has always come out great the only thing i change is i use cake flour softassilk brand
5,i made it for my grandmas birthday i have never heard so many compliments in my life even one of my older sisters who doesnt like chocolate she had a piece and told me that it was the only kind of chocolate that tasted good i had never felt so honored im planning on making it on this oncoming christmas for the rest of my family but this is the best cake that i have ever made lt

5,this made a large cake big layers and it was very good very intensely chocolate the frosting was decadent i am going to use it on other cakes that call for chocolate frosting recommend this recipe
5,mmmmmmmm this cake was so good and fluffy and soft it was amazing i put a raspberry frosting between the layers and frosted the outside with chocolate icing i only had about cup sour cream and was out of yogurt so i substituted a tablespoon or two of cream cheese and filled up the rest with milk odd but it worked well i also only had eggs so i used tbs of water with tsp of baking powder and tsp of canola oil thank you internet i baked it for ish minuted and it was cooked thoroughly thank you for this recipe it was amazing
5,love this chocolate cake normally a die hard yellow cake fan however my childrens bday coming up
5,best chocolate cake ever made it for easter and got rave reviews from some very picky people made my caramel frosting instead of the chocolate couldnt be happier with the outcome thanks taste of home
5,excellent cake and icing super moist and flavourful cake and icing is perfect consistency i bake mine in ea round pans so i could do thinner layers as a professional chef not pastry but still i would say this is the best cake recipe i have found anywhere if you want to go beyond the box cake mix and try something a little bit more challenging look no further
5,i have made this cake many times it always come out perfectly and i always get rave reviews the people having problems probably didnt follow directions baking is a science if you arent exact in your measurements and use the right size pan it wont work
5,wow i made this cake for the th of july whats more american than chocolate cake right and it was a grand slam home run with everyone i made the recipe exactly as stated except i added a generous dash of cinnamon to the batter with the other dry ingredients the cake came out exactly like it looks in the picture on the website it is so delicious i cant stop eating it its dense i love dense cakes as opposed to light and airy spongy cakes super moist and full of chocolate flavor the frosting pairs perfectly with the cake the recipe made three full size inch layers i just wrapped one layer in plastic wrap and foil and put it in the freezer for another day the frosting was more than enough to generously frost two layers and then have about a cup leftover at first i was stumped because i never heard of leftover frosting before not in my house this frosting recipe left enough leftover for us spoonlovingfrostingeating adults and more for another time i bet i could even frost dozen cupcakes with the leftover frosting so to sum it up if you love rich chocolately moist dense cake with tangy sweet chocolately frosting of which you will have some leftover then make this cake thank you for sharing sandy this cake recipe deserves that winning ribbon
5,wow is right a beautiful tall moist dense chocolate cake with wonderful rich chocolate frosting to die for the frosting was just the right consistency to hide a small crack in one of the layers the cake is going to my church homecoming tomorrow ill be lucky to bring home a crumb or two
5,ive made this recipe about five times and it comes out beautifully each time i even made it for my sisters wedding and everyone loved it the cupcakes are a little denser than a regular cupcake but i like them that way
5,these are the best
5,so good im making these for my fall wedding making sure the butter and cream cheese are at room temp helped ensure a silky smooth frosting the spice level in both the frosting and the cupcake is spot on the cupcakes have fresh pure ingredients so theyre heavierdenser than box mix cupcakes these are on my top cupcakes list
5,i used all organic ingredients my husband gave these two thumbs up and said intense pumpkin flavor next time i make them i will add raisins to the batter and sprinkle crushed candied pecans over the frosting superb cupcakes and an easy recipe happy fall yall
5,this recipe is absolute perfection i brought the cupcakes to a bake sale at work and couldnt have gotten better reviews i used powdered buttermilk mixed in with the dry ingredients rather than liquid buttermilk but the consistency was excellent perfectly moist these are perfect for fall and i will make them over and over
5,hi im about to try these out do you use salted or unsalted butterupdate used salted butter these are the best cupcakes i have ever cooked by far and im not even a pumpkin fan the pumpkin flavor is light and it balances so well with the cinammon cream cheese frosting thank you so much i will be making these every fall for the rest of my life
5,these are absolutely delicious it is one of my favorite fall cakes to make the cake has a nice spice and its not dry the cinnamon in the cream cheese frosting is the perfect finishing touch
5,i made these last nightfollowed the recipe completely didnt change a thing they were amazingi made them for my husband for work they were gone quick he said i will for sure be making these again
5,i made these today they were easy to make and the recipe was easy to follow i am taking them to a party and im sure everyone will love them im sure i will be making them year round we love pumpkin
5,these were awesome i did however fill them with a whipped cream and vanilla pumkin spiced pudding it just added that wow factor
5,yes it is i have made it at approximately feet elevation with perfect results
5,these were sooo good i altered one thing only used c of powdered sugar in the icing and it was plenty sweet for us i will definitely make these again
5,i didnt plan on baking today but i received this recipe in my email and wow the cupcakes are amazing they didnt rise up much but thats ok just eat another to make up for it i dont think i have ever baked a cake without vanilla extract and the batter recipe didnt call for it so i added some the added vanilla made the cupcakes almost too sweet and i love sweet but next time i wont add any there is already some vanilla in the frosting that is probably enough also this recipe made dozen cupcakes plus a small bundt cake you could easily get dozen cupcakes from this recipe i will definitely make this recipe again it is a keeper
5,we use less sugar in the frosting also and its still delicious try with craisins in the batter with the candied pecans on top
5,i think ive established a new holiday staple in our home i used my stand mixer and followed manufacturers guidelines on speed and length of time for mixing ingredients at each step of the way the cupcakes came out tender and fluffy a definite hit with my family and another family we shared with we will definitely cook these again during pumpkin season
5,very moist light texture delicious only fault with this recipe is that it was entirely too much frosting next time i will make half as much frosting great recipe made cupcakes
5,this cake was delicious its been a hit each time ive made it
5,this is a fantastic cake for carving novelty cakes i used a bread knife and there were so few crumbs im grateful for this recipe as i had tried another with poor results and i was practically out of regular sugar thankfully i had these ingredients on hand so my son ended up with a beautiful birthday cake that tasted delicious it was perfect just a note to other bakers after cooling and resting this cake seemed to compress a tad more than most other cakes i used shaped pans bit had to do carving to get it right it was very worth it the rocket cake had a tapered base and wide middle but the cake still stood firmly on its own and the two bakers who tried the cake asked for the recipe thank you
5,have made this many times with beautiful success and currently have a halved recipe in the oven in cake layersfor the not rising comment i wonder how old the baking soda was or if toni used cold liquids a quick tip to make sure that the cake has a good bake or to make any cake bake well is to have roomtemperature liquidssoft solids i allow the butter eggs and sour cream to get to room temperature before using them i always keep my vanilla extract at room temperature i also used cake flour and follow the tips on the cake flour box about how to compensate for allpurpose flour it does make a difference for cakes i promise while the batter does get more liquidy after adding the water i wonder if esteli had the oven preheated to the right temperatureif you dont prefer the frosting there are thousands of frosting recipes out there pick one that is highly rated by many people and try it
5,loved by the whole family for my fathers th birthday i needed to make it dairy free so i used dairyfree margarine and sour cream in the cake and frosting for the baking pans i always grease line with parchment paper grease and flour so the cakes come out effortlessly
5,this recipe is perfect as written i didnt change a thing and got fantastic reviews from friends and family exactly what i was looking for
5,i made this yesterday for my birthday cake i used cake flour and subbed hot dark roast coffee in place of the boiling water and also sifted the dry ingredients to be sure all of the lumps were out but otherwise followed the recipe exactly after adding the hot coffee the batter was really thin ive never made a cake with such runny batter before and was a little nervous about it i baked layers on the top rack and on the bottom rack the top rack cakes were ready at the minute mark so i pulled them outthe cake that had been on the bottom rack was still liquid in the middle so i moved it to the top rack and baked it another or minutes the top of that rd layer had a funny darkened pupilinaneyeball sort of center appearance probably from the jiggling it received when i moved it to the top rack but it was fully baked and unnoticeable once it was frosted i made my own frosting a butter amp cocoa powder version that i know is delicious since some folks mentioned they didnt like the sour cream flavored icing much the cake had a nice dense moist texture and a great nottoochocolatey flavor it makes a huge cake mine was tall when assembled so be sure to cut thin slices i will save this to bake again we shared a huge chunk with the neighbors and are still enjoying leftovers
5,i tried this once after stumbling across it my family was amazed hard to find it again but so glad i didwrote it down this time
5,this cake is amazing and does make a large cake ive made it twice now and the reviews were outstanding very moist and dense be prepared and have some cake lovers ready to help eat it could halve the recipe and have enough for a smaller crowd i read one review that said it wasnt chocolatey enough or lacked chocolate flavor so not true you can control the depth of chocolate flavor by the quality of the cocoa powder you use deep rich chocolate flavor with scharffen berger cocoa powder this will forever be my chocolate cake recipe
5,i never make a cake that i thought came out well until this one great recipe easy and nice and moist a keeper
5,this cake recipe is delicious i did not use the frosting recipe because i made a ho ho cake and tried the cake because i didnt have a chocolate cake mix i used cup of sour cream because that is all i had on hand the cake was so moist and the best chocolate cake ive ever tasted i baked it in a lasagna pan instead thanks sandy for sharing your recipe
5,tis cake is so like my aunts scratch cake but quicker for the person who said it wasnt chocolatey enough try replacing the water with strong coffee i do this for most chocolate bake goods and people always mention the flavor being kicked up a notch from what they bake
5,made this cake for my husband and he ate almost all the cake fudgy and delicious i too used coffee instead of water wonderful texture and crumb will definitely make this again
5,i took this to a special choc cake contest at the polk county fair saturday and it took first place its excellent i would highly recommend i baked it exactly as the recipe was written
5,my family declared this the best chocolate cake ever i used my own homemade frosting sift cup cocoa powder cup powdered sugar dash salt and cream with cup crisco or butter add whipped egg white a great recipe would not change a thing about the cake
5,tasty and yum want eat
5,just made this cake over the weekend for my husband and for the cocoa powder i used hersheys special dark the cake was so moist and my family loved it its definitely been added to my recipe collection
5,sandy u never fail to amaze me i luv this cake
5,i luv this cake
5,this was the most delicious chocolate cake i didnt change a thing the flavor and moistness that the sour cream gave it was unlike any other it kept for several days before even beginning to get slightly dry which is definitely worth a of a five star rating in my book will definitely make again
5,i baked the chocolate cake tonight and it is beautiful the layers or high so it made a big cake the flavor is great the icing is wonderful and easy to make i will make this cake again for thanksgiving i will post a picture on fb
5,awesome cake outstanding several days later as well didnt change a thing
5,this cake is awesome i live at high altitude and had to make adjustments to account for that i decreased the sugar to cups increased the flour to cups increased the water by adding an additional cup and decreased baking soda to tsp i made cupcakes instead of cake i usually let my batter rest for at least minutes before baking however i made my first batch as soon as the batter was loaded and the cupcakes rose okay but spread a little the batter that had a chance to rest made perfect cupcakes they rose without spreading at all its important at high altitude to not fill the pans too high i filled them to about a half to inch from the top and it was perfect unfortunately there are no magic adjustments that you can use for every recipe its all trial and error at altitude but my adjustments luckily were perfect for this recipe
5,truly the perfect chocolate cake if you are looking for an elegant chocolate cake for a special occasion look no further it tastes like heavenly fudge looks beautiful in a cake dish and cuts into nice slices without crumbling better than anything you could buy in a bakery thank you sandra johnson
5,this is absolutely the best chocolate cake i have ever had it is totally worth the effort thank you so much for sharing
5,best cake i have ever made
5,just made the cake for a birthday in a darth vader shaped cake pan and it came out beautifully and made a dozen cupcakes with the leftover batter its very moist and was such a hit this recipe is definitely a keeper
5,stars doesnt cover it this was the most amazing cake this was the first time i made a cake from scratch my daughter requested it for christmas so moist and fudgy you will not be disappointed
5,excellent cake i use cake flour and substitute hot black coffee for the hot water i have tried other substitutions but they do not improve the cake this is a very rich cake because of the sour cream so a small piece of cake is very filling to keep the cake tender go easy on the mixing and get the cake in the oven as soon as the mixing is complete
5,this cake is amazing it doesnt last long around this house
5,unbelievable super moist and full of flavour love it
5,i made a version of this cake for mothers day it is truly one of the best cakes we have ever had all while being easy to make thank you for this recipe
5,cake is dense with deep rich flavor icing is complex together its a little too rich next time im going to make it with butter cream frosting this cake shows pretty and serves easilt
5,taste great my family lived ut
5,i have tried a lot of chocolate cake recipes and this one is by far the best it also makes quite a bit of cake this is the only recipe i use for chocolate cake
5,now this is what chocolate cake is all about rich amp oh soooo decadent one of the best recipes ever and not too difficult thanks for sharing sandy
5,perfect chocolate cake recipe i used half of all ingredients and used a bundt pan it looked beautiful garnished with ganache and strawbwrries
5,i made this and it turned out delicious it was easy to follow and i will be making this again my family love it
5,this is undoubtedly the absolute best chocolate cake and frosting ive ever tasted i ended up having to add an additional cup or so of powdered sugar i sifted the sugar before measuring and probably shouldnt have it didnt say to i was afraid it might be lumpy if i didnt sifting probably made it not fill the measuring cup as full when measuring sandy i can see why you won the contestwhen reading the recipe it had a few things completely different from all the methods ive ever used and made me want to try it to see how it turned out it is absolutely wonderful
5,one of the best ever among choc cakes but sandy or anyone please tell me whats the ingredients in this recipe that makes it stand out from an average choc cake
5,this cake and frosting are absolutely delicious it tastes even more delicious the second day i made cupcakes for a large birthday party it makes cupcakes a
5,best simple chocolate cake evereasy and yummy stars easily
5,i made this cake in a x pan it took about an hour to bake this is such a good cake i am not a big fan of frosting so i didnt frost it and it sure didnt need it good job
5,perfect light and fluffy
5,came out perfectly a very delicious chocolate cake however not too happy with frosting and may put some cream cheese or something to it the next time
5,hi just wondering if i can use buttermilk instead of sour cream in this receipe very keen to try this chocolate cake version
5,wow what can i say pulled out my cake from the oven about hours ago and there is nothing left delicious i did do a slight change instead of plain boiling water i used fresh brewed coffee got to go making another one thanks
5,i baked mine in a bundt pan omitting the icing it is the best chocolate cake recipe ive ever tried
5,i agree with others this is the perfect chocolate cake and my new goto recipe for birthday and other special occasions ive never had good luck with layer cakes but this one worked perfectly first time i forgot to add water love the idea of using coffee instead of water but it still turned out fine second time the batter at the bottom of the bowl did not get mixed well and it still turned out okay each time i spread raspberry preserves between layers and on top prior to frosting love the silky smooth frosting then i made genache and poured it over the topso rich and yummy cant wait to make another one
5,this is an amazingly moist cake and the icing is the easiest icing ive ever worked with i did sub the sour cream for cream cheese but it turned out phenomenal definitely the ultimate chocolate cake
5,everyone in my family agreed this was the best cake theyd ever had i made just a few adjustments i added in a tsp each of espresso powder and cinnamon and i just made a simple ganache frosting because i was out of powdered sugar will make again and again
5,these were so good i only used cups of confectioners sugar but probably could have gotten away with cups and i only used tsp cinnamon in the frosting because i didnt want the cinnamon to over power it i have frosting left over amp may make another batch to give away
5,this is an amazing recipe im gonna be the hero this thanksgiving so so perfect in every way that little bit of ginger is genius
5,best cupcakes ever i am not usually a fan of pumpkin so i really just made these for my familybut i love them we have now made them several times and they are delicious the only change we make is leaving out the ginger because we thought it might be too strong in the cupcakes
5,absolutely love these we have these for every birthday now not just in fall
5,delicious cupcakes left out the cinnamon in the frosting i had some pumpkin cookies that i put in the food processor and sprinkled on the top of the frosted cupcakes were amazing
5,this recipe is soooo good i make it all the time for potluck breakfasts amp brunches
5,this is one of my favorites we are on a cooking team with four other couples at st bartholomews episcopal church in wichita kansas each week a team cooks breakfast every sunday during the year my husband and i take turns choosing what we want to fix this is high on my list as the cottage cheese makes it so moist and deliciousi vary on the cheddar cheese and use what i have on hand sometimes i may add two or more different cheeses when i make a triple batch i add different meats as well to the casserole depending what is on sale at the store this is always a big hit with our parish of peoplewe charge a donation to cover the cost of the meal and what money is over the cost goes back to the church as my husband would say the best breakfast in town diane chambers
5,i have made this recipe multiple times and our ladies sunday school class asks for it everytime there is a ladies brunch etc i use a pound of real bacon bits instead of cooking up bacon dried onion pieces can be used in place of chopped onion i increase the eggs to use package of shredded hash brown potatoes oz package from the refrigerator section i chop up sliced swiss cheese since i can never find shredded swiss already packaged and make no changes on the cottage cheese this casserole is a big hit and by using some of the easier ways to get ingredients it is not hard to make i have never tried to freeze this but since i am making one for sunday i may try freezing a small amount to see how it holds up
5,i love this recipe every time i make it i have an empty pan i like to fry the bacon and cut the onion up the night before to cut down on prep time in the morning
5,this was delicious i like sauteing my onions in the bacon drippings i added chopped bell pepper and used the cheeses i had on hand no swiss it is an easy recipe and is easy to make changes to fit what is in your pantry
5,oh my this turned out just perfect i made a half batch just in case we didnt care for it and it was gone in no time ive been looking for a simple breakfast recipe to serve thanksgiving morning and this is it i used breakfast sausage in place of the bacon and i skipped the onions on accident still it was just perfect its like a cheesy quiche meets yummy scrambled eggs thanks for sharing
5,the most delicious breakfast cassarole ive ever made
5,we had family members coming for breakfast on christmas morning so we had two different recipes to try and this one was a hit no one had any idea cottage cheese was in it i cooked the chopped onions with the bacon and used the freeze dried hashbrowns just added the water and waited min and then added everything and baked next year we are only going to make this recipe we added a ham fresh fruit and a stuffed french toast casserole and everyone was happy
5,excellent really really good i used kielbasa instead of bacon and it was fantastic a hit with the entire family
5,needed something for a birthday food day at workthis was easy delicious and everyone loved it i highly recommend it
5,so decadent i made this for my sweetheart on his birthday we had guests everyone raved about how velvety smooth is was my house smelled like chocolate for hours on end i found it to be rich but not heavy amazing chocolate flavor
5,one of the best everyone loved it
5,hands down the best chocolate cake we have ever made my daughter and i made this as the centerpiece of our family holiday meal and it did not disappoint the frosting is on the sweet side but it balances the cake we made the cake with coffee instead of water and it was wonderful first dessert to go on a well stocked dessert table this recipe is a keeper
5,divine this has become my go to chocolate cake recipe
5,followed recipe as written the cake was moist and delicious would definitely make again only change i would make is to line bottom of pan with parchment or waxed paper to make it easier to remove from pan
5,i made this for my husbands birthday party since he requested chocolate cake and everyone raved about it there were people at the party and we still had lots leftover even though some guests had seconds and thirds it tastes so much better after being refrigerated overnight i highly recomend this recipenote i used only semisweet chocolate since i didnt have unsweetened and it still tasted wonderful not too sweet
5,so long chocolate store box cake this cake was very moist i will definitely be making it again the the future the frosting was a little sweet for us so i will just cut back on the confectioners sugar next time but a great recipe
5,best chocolate cake ever moist delicious and looked beautiful will definitely be my go to cake
5,one of the best chocolate cake recipes ive ever followed
5,beautiful moist cake its my new goto chocolate cake recipe when i dont want to make a flourless cake and i dont want to make one with a browniedecadence density one thing i do is add espresso powder though its almost a kneejerk reaction for me to find some way to add more flavor to a baked item that requires water than simply adding water substituting the water with hot coffee or just adding a teaspoon or so of espresso powder to the boiling water is a great way to accent the chocolate flavor wonderful recipe
5,i made this cake for a potluck luncheon i put a layer of vanilla cream pudding between the layers it was a big hit at the potluck this cake is very rich and dense
5,is the baking cocoa for the cake semisweet or unsweetenedthank you pj
5,what is sour creamcan we adjust it with yoghurt
5,best cake ever been making this one since its a mable hoffman recipe first showed up in the ladies home journal that year i also often will freeze the third layer and tote the other two to whatever event needs a great chocolate cake
5,makes a very tall cake with perfect amount of frosting for between and over the cake will make again
5,i am a eleven year old girl i used your resipy to make cupkakes and i got first place thank you so much
5,amazing cake i made this cake for the first time and it is wonderful my husband and many of the individuals that we shared with stated that it was the best chocolate cake that they ever had i totally agree and will make it many times again it is one of our favorites also i agree with other reviewers each layer of cake is a nice size and there is plenty of icing to coat the whole cake nicely
5,this is the best chocolate cake i have ever baked it has become my friends and familys favorite i melt a bar of bittersweet chocolate and spread it each layer and then top it with the frosting i gives it a slight crunch with a burst of chocolate yummy
5,im rating stars because its really delish but i would not take mine anywhere because of how it looked the layers rose in the oven but sunk in the middle as they cooled and no nothing happened to make them fall what could i have done wrongi think i packed the brown sugar too firmly because it took forever to cream with the amount of butter and to me never got the fluffy texture so would overbeating have done itthanks for your inputthanks
5,excellent good for a crowd
5,this cake is wonderful i followed the recipe exactly except i only made round cakes instead of and it was perfect
5,made this cake for my husbands birthdayfollowed directions exactly as written and it turned out perfectly i did not use the frosting my husband requested a different kind coconut but i look forward to trying the frosting out in the future
5,i shared with family and friends they said it was the best chocolate cake they had ever put in their mouths will definitely make it again

5,this is one the best if not the best chocolate cake ive ever tasted or made i always use a little extra chocolate in all my recipes plus i used pure mexican vanilla in this recipe thanks for sharing sandy
5,im a sucker for chocolate cake but was surprised to see the hot water is added at the end of mixing the batter i use hersheys special dark cocoa and i always predisolve the cocoa with hot strong coffee then i add it to the batter making for a super dark cake the only change i made in this recipe was taking cup water and replacing with hot coffee to dissolve my cocoa powder delicious cake

5,this was on the cover and pg of the latest issue and i decided to try it for a formal dinner dance i was attending i was pleased that i had all the ingredients and that the directions were very simple it was easy to make and then when i put it together the next day it came together beautifullybest frosting so yummy it was so fancy when sliced and displayed and all my close friends were demanding slices as soon as they saw it my dessert was the first to go and everyone declared it to be one of the best chocolate cakes they had ever had the balance of the sour cream with the sugar kept it from being overwhelmingly sweet and it was more old school in recipe without the white sugar and with the boiling water and sour cream i used semisweet chocolate chips instead of the semisweet bakers chocolate the frosting is plentiful and delicious and for a garnish i crushed up some chocolate chips and dusted the top it was a massive hit everyone declared it to be so moist and to taste like it came from a bakery definitely an awesome cake will be making it again for thanksgiving
5,i consider myself a serious cake baker and pride myself in knowing a great cake from just a good one great chocolate cake recipes are very hard to find this is a great chocolate cake recipe i made it with cake flour because i didnt have any ap flour it turned out super it was moist but not heavy just light the flavors were well rounded but not too sweet and the texture was super i believe the brown sugar and the sour cream really set it apart from any other chocolate cake i ever made this one was perfect i didnt perfect the frosting but the cake is definitely a keeper

5,we love this recipe i will put it in my meal rotation i loved the fact that i could clean up each step while the next step was cooking as well as preparing a tossed salad i had a clean kitchen when it came out of the oven i served it with the salad and roasted yukon gold potatoes delicious
5,very delicious loved it would not change anything
5,this was so simple but soooo good i did add a little garlic salt but other than that i followed the recipe big hit
5,this has become one of our favorite go to recipes its flavorful healthy and easy to prepare if i am serving it with riced cauliflower a very healthy swap for rice i double the mushrooms and broth and add a little flour to thicken slightly so that we can spoon that goodness over the riced cauliflower
5,my new go to chicken recipe i double the mushrooms amp butter and add a c white wine to the broth we like lots of gravy to serve with the mashed potatoes i serve with this along with either green beans my husbands favorite or corn great meal that is quick amp easy
5,this was absolutely delicious i am sick of grilled chicken at this point in the summer and wanted something different i had mushrooms i needed to use when i stumbled upon this recipe since it makes servings my husband and i have leftovers for another night i cant wait
5,this is such a great recipe for chicken i used cup of broth because cup just did not seem enough i added diced potatoes to the mushroom mix i cooked it the same amount of time and the potatoes were done that extra cup of broth made gravy for the potatoes i will be making this again
5,hubby and i found this recipe was a star i did add a few things which is very much what i always seem to do first i didnt have the chicken breast so i used the chicken thighs i didnt skin or debone them i used them as they were just made sure i cooked them long enough second i also added some seasonings to the flour onion powder garlic powder amp italian seasoning along with sampp third to the broth i added the juice of one lemon right now i seem to have a lot of lemons and i like using them whenever i can they seem to brighten the flavor because there is only the two of us this recipe has given me two nights worth of dinners cook once eat twice
5,this was great might add a pinch of cayenne to the flour next time
5,so happy the sauce is homemade instead of using canned soup which is full of things i dont want to put in my body
5,this is the best chocolate cake ive ever tasted making another one to send to my sons house for easter dinner thank you sandy
5,outstanding i made this cake for my husbands birthday and it was a huge hit we love very nice restaurants and this reminded us of a dessert there just add a dallop of real whipped cream and you have an elegant dessert cut the pieces thin because it is rich this is a new family favorite deena
5,delicious and very moist cake i usually dont risk trying out a new recipe for company but since it won a contest over other cakes i made it and took it to a party and everyone loved it
5,alice look at step
5,my husbands comment with the first bite this is delicious my favorite taste tester food judge really liked this dish and so did i i followed the recipe ingredients exactly other than upgrading by using portobello mushrooms procedurewise i sliced two oz chicken breasts lengthwise rather than pound them to thickness doing that saved a little effort and it did not at all impact the taste this recipe can make a novice cook look like a seasoned pro it was flavorful juicy and the two of us could have easily eaten the other two servings i will definitely be making this again i liked the idea shared in the reviews of sauteing the onions im also toying with the idea of using half chicken broth and half white wine for the sauce mixture to answer lousey cook in texas question i dont know that it would taste as good as making it fresh the breading on the chicken might get a bit soggy you could try it but it really doesnt take long to put this all together
5,my whole family loved this recipe the chicken was so tender a very easy recipe to make it is definitely a keeper
5,uh so this is phenomenal the only change i made was adding some white wine to the skillet with the mushrooms so so good
5,made this last night so easy so good
5,restaurant quality
5,very tasty instead of pounding the chicken breasts which were large i sliced them in half which worked well i also used a heavy hand with the mushrooms because i like them
5,this has got to be one of my favorite baked chicken dishes it is easy and doesnt seem like it would be that flavorful but it is so glad i tried it whole family gave it a thumbs up make sure you use every drop of mushroom sauce on the chicken breasts and we used a good amount of green onions because we like them
5,ok i just made this i didnt have any green onions so had to leave them off still very very good thanks to gail for the idea to cut the chicken breasts in half worked perfectly theres nothing about this recipe i would change thanks for sharing i should say i rarely create accounts on websites but i did here just to rate the recipe
5,very nice i loved that it was quick to make following ideas from other reviewers i sliced my large chicken breasts in half that worked well i also added c white wine to the sauce and the little remaining flour left after dredging the breasts to thicken it a little i was heavy on the mushrooms cause we love them i added some snipped fresh rosemary and chives to the sauce because we love fresh herbs i served over zucchini noodles and asparagus that were sautéed in olive oil garlic and a sprinkling of parmesan cheese it was delightful the only change i will make next time is to double the sauce we would have enjoyed more over our zoodles would serve this to company
5,my go to now always elegant to serve easy and tasty
5,this is a fan favorite in our house my kids ask for it all the time its a very simple recipe with a lot of flavor the only things i do different is use a lot more mushrooms and a little bit more of the mozzarella cheese because my family loves both i love to serve this alongside some fresh steamed or roasted asparagus and smashed redskin potatoes
5,family loved it i am diabetic so i altered the recipe by using almond flour instead of regular flour deglazed the pan with white wine then sautéed shallots garlic and fresh spinach along with the mushrooms calculated one serving calories carbs is respectable without the math
5,delish such an easy recipe yet so good my husband loved the mushroomsand i did put extra in the dish
5,i give this recipe an a yummy yummy yummy
5,ive made this several times delicious and like the idea of dry sherry instead of brothwill definitely try that next time
5,sounds delicious
5,excellent fast and easy used extra mushrooms and instead of pounding chicken just sliced into two thin breasts very flavorful and moist keeper
5,i added a small halved and sliced vidalia onion to the mushroom saute i used the entire container of sliced baby bella mushrooms maybe cups rather than dirty an x pan i added the chicken breast back to my heavy saute pan spooned the lovely mushroom and onion sauce over and baked moist and perfectly done at minutes oops i forgot to add the grated cheese but didnt miss it
5,i made this last night for our girls game night dinner and everyone loved it doubled the mushrooms and butter they were sauted in and used cup chicken broth and cup sherry for more sauce on the chicken served it with steamed broccoli and rice excellent i will definitely make this again
5,this chicken is a hit with my family and for anyone i prepare it for it is so very good
5,made this the other night and it was delicious i had a bit of chardonnay that i added in my husband liked it and the chicken was very moist you really dont need any added salt because of the cheeses great recipe
5,i thought it was absolutely delicious i did make one change so i wouldnt have to pound the chicken i used boneless skinless thighs everything else i followed to the letter will definitely make again
5,awesome i have made this a couple of times i use way more mushrooms and chicken broth so i have lots to add to each chicken i also add garlic and use shredded parmesan this is soooo good
5,awesome this recipe is definitely a must for keeping i did add more mushrooms and i salted peppered and added garlic to the chicken breast before flouring this would also be great for dinner guests thanks so mush for sharing
5,delicious made tonite for dinner and my husband and i really enjoyed the chicken i added some koser salt ground pepper and garlic powder to the flour before dredging the chicken will definitely make again for the whole family for our sunday get togethers
5,made with sherry instead of broth and left out the mozzarella because i didnt have any family loved it will try doubling the mushrooms and sauce next time delicious

5,great dish very easy and full of flavor used thin breast and did not flatten them
5,wonderful dish a local restaurant has a similar dish but this is much better i tend to always pound the chicken breasts as they cook evenly and are so tender
5,ive made this a few times now and its fabulous everyone thats eaten it has wanted the recipe its a keeper ive noted that the size the breasts are flattened to is not as important as simply keeping them uniform so that they cook evenly

5,had guests for breakfast on sunday adults ate the entire pan i used one lb of bulk italian sausage instead of bacon i added two more eggs and i used the entire bag of potatos this will become a regular dish at our house when i shared this with a friend she said this dish is safe for those with celiac disease because no bread
5,this is the best wonderful flavor and so easy stir everything all together night before have tried many egg stratus and this is by far the best company all wanted the recipe
5,ive made this many times used ham bacon amp hot sausage i always use fresh potatoes for the lady that said her potatoes were brown all you need to do is soak them in water as soon as you take them out of food processor it is so much cheaper this way instead of buying the frozen ones and i always have potatoes on hand
5,loved this recipe my daughter had a birthday sleepover with girls and this made enough for all of them they loved and it was a good lower carb recipe as to one of the girls is a diabetic needless to say that girls mom walked out the door with this recipe too
5,i make this at least once a month however ive tweaked it to our liking i use a lb of bacon and a lb of sausagei also make my own homemade hashbrowns and brown them with onions we like them better if they are cooked to make them a little crunchier than the frozen ones used in the original recipe i also put of the mixture in the pan and then put swiss slices and the rest on top with cheddar to cover the topguess you could say all i use the recipe for anymore is a list of ingredients but it was awesome as it is written as well
5,wanted to try something new for xmas morning weve had the same thing every year for a while i made it early to give it a try and avery one loved it even the kids

5,this has been a family favorite in our house for years i admit i always use more cheese than it calls for probably c and i use the whole oz package of mushrooms
5,wow is all i can say this is so yummy i think the only thing i would do differently is eliminate the salt and add a little garlic it was perfect with an entire oz container of mushrooms with some rice pilaf on the side anything more would have been too much food definitely making this again soon
5,ths is one of the best chicken recipes ive ever found

5,this chicken was absolutely delicious im on the lookout for low carbohydrate recipes as my boyfriend is watching his carbs and this filled the bill nicely i could make it even more lowcarb by just browning the breasts without the flour the list of ingredients was simple and i wasnt expecting it to taste as wonderful as it did great recipe everyone loved it
5,wow everyone loved it i didnt have mozzarella cheese or green onions and it was still wonderful next time ill try to have both we ate hours ago and i can still taste it definately will make this one again

5,one of my favorite company dishes especially when it isnt grilling season so moist and flavorful i always receive rave reviews delicious with the herbed angel hair pasta
5,me and my husband really liked it i didnt have any green onions but it turned out really well i used about a cup of broth to start out with and it boiled down good i loved the cheese on top and probably put more than called for the mushrooms were fantastic
5,i dont use the cheese we love this dish
5,this chicken turned out very flavorful and moist i left out the mushrooms and added onions and italian herbs as i did not have any mushrooms it is a great gourmetstyle recipe that is not too complicated i would definitely make this again
5,wonderfully flavored cake i followed the advice of one reviewer by adding the vanilla after i added the hot milk and butter i baked it for minutes and dusted the top with powdered sugar
5,my mom gave this recipe to me years ago and it was perfect for strawberry shortcake it transported well and held up well with the addition of the strawberry sauce easy to make and everyone enjoyed it

5,i loved it
5,great my husband loved it and we will be making it again
5,i loved it and my guest did also i cut it in half for two people i pounded then instead of putting flour on it i sprinkled it with mccormicks perfect pinch garlic amp herb salt free then put it in an x pan with the mushrooms and onions on it and baked it covered then uncovered it and put the cheese on it
5,i cant get over how delicious this dish was it is by far one of my favorites thanks for sharing
5,my kids loved it especially my oldest daughter
5,delicious and yes i beat the eggs for full minutes
5,i made this cake for the first time many years ago when my children still lived at home i took it out of the oven and my husband and i had a piece and loved it then our son and his friend and our daughter came home from high school they tried it and loved it then a friend stopped by to drop something off she tried it and loved it as well im so glad i still have the recipe
5,what a delicious cake i halved the recipe and baked it in a inch round cake pan i baked it mins probably could have used another couple of minutes and i should have used butter and flour in the pan instead of spray it did stick but my son and i were instantly addicted my only changes were using whole milk all i had and adding a pinch of salt and btwi also used regular salted butter too this came together so quickly and it is perfect eaten warm
5,this is an excellent cake very tasty goes really well with strawberries
5,healthy recipethank you
5,i have made this cake multiple times and my family loves it i topped it with strawberries and some whip cream and it is an instant success
5,i made this once and it turned out amazing i have a terrible oven so i set it to and it took longer but worked out i topped mine with strawberry jam has anyone tried making this into a cupcake
5,delicious and different as i was not prepared for the spongelike texture served with lemon curd and whipped cream as with most cake recipes i come across and dont see salt i added about tsp plus used one tbsp high quality vanilla after greasing glass cake pan i sprinkled it with sugar before adding batter and for me cake took longer to bake than minutes while increased baking time gradually this cake could definitely be substituted for the biscuits in shortcake yum
5,i realized i never reviewed this recipe and what an oversight that was this cake is amazing so easy too
5,i have used this recipe many times for layer cakes for my kids birthdays i have added a pinch of salt a few times other times i have poked holes with a chopstick and poured in jello and i have at times dumped a bunch of cocoa powder in with the dry ingredients they have all turned out great i like this cake because it is structurally sound and can withstand icing like a champ use a long bread knife to slice off the slight dome when i use buttercream i do a thin crumb coat stick it in the fridge wash a couple of dishes and then the do the real icing beautiful every time
5,not sure what all the negative comments are about i baked this with very little skill and it turned out absolutely perfect the cake was so soft and wonderful the only thing i did was reduce the sugar to and cup because i frosted the cake please do bake this cake its such a great simple and delicious one
5,seriously easy super tasty and the perfect way to use up closetodate milk ive used whole and with perfect success our kids are wild about this cakeespecially when paired with a warm caramel sauce this one is a keeper
5,so good you can probably get away with putting less sugar in it if you wanted but how much less i dont know i had to bake it about mins longer than stated but my dad said its the best white cake hes ever had yes i know its not white cake but its similar
5,an excellent recipe i like to try new recipes when i have just a cup or so of whole milk remaining just to see what i can accomplish im rarely disappointed and a search today led me to this one which i will keep it is amazing will top some pieces with some raspberries that i froze at the end of the season last year the canes are already getting ready to produce a new crop and we will enjoy it this evening thank you
5,i love this cake its the perfect base for strawberry shortcake or for a topping of any fruit with whipped cream leftovers are great with a cup of coffee in the morning i dont understand those who had trouble but cakes are one of those things that you have to follow instructions carefully
5,i cannot understand how anyone can have a failure with this recipe ive been using it for a number of years and it always turns out as shown in fact i made it a few days ago and have given the recipe to two friends because they liked it so well
5,after reading the reviews i changed this around i added a t of vanilla bean paste plus the t of vanilla i used half and half instead of i beat the eggs a long time until they were light and fluffy and then added the sugar and beat again until light and fluffy for quite a bit my batter was smooth and creamy i baked this in a glass baking dish so i reduced my oven temp to when it was done and cooled i made a fresh blueberry compote to serve on top with a dollop of homemade whipped cream but refrigerated whipped topping would work just as well i liked it because its a light dessert without heavy frosting to hold it down perfect for a light spring or summer supper
5,i am an have been baking this cake since i was i have never had it to failever about years ago i started adding a broiled topping and serving with whipped cream it is delicious and loved at the church and quilt potlucks here is broiled topping c packed brown sugar c butter c half and half bring to a boil and stir until sugar is dissolved remove and add c coconut and c chopped nuts broil until bubbly and lightly browned make this in the morning so that the topping flavors can meld into the cake
5,i followed the recipe exactly as stated but i did add more vanilla and it was delicious will definitely make again i served mine with fresh berries and whip cream
5,just made it but didnt follow the instructions due to habit i mixed all dry ingredients before i realized that wasnt the way but i added them slowly to the batter and it came out perfectly and is delicious
5,this cake came out exactly as i expected it would the negative reviews i imagine come from negative haters some people are only happy when ripping others down my suggestion is to learn how to bake before you comment delicious cake and im looking forward to some truffle tonight
5,well i made the recipe tonight nice basic ingredients that i already had and a simple recipe wanted to start a little tradition with my young daughters that they could pass on making a simple cake from scratch while it was a little sweet for my own taste they absolutely loved it the texture was spongy and moist and the plain cake was a hit solo i also made a berry compote to add a bit of tartness for my own preference and my moms and the girls loved that too i guess the key is in proper mixing not a fake review there were a couple negative reviews from socalled baking professionals that said the cake turned out awful or that the positive reviews were not genuine real mom here
5,fabulous i didnt change a thing i put whipped topping and fresh strawberries on top my husband loved it thank you
5,i remember my mama making this cake it is basic and tasty more of a pound cake than a fluffy cake and really good for snacking she would sometimes frost with buttercream and sprinkle heavily with chopped peanuts sure does bring back memories
5,very yummy a nice combination of moist and light i wish i had fresh strawberries because they would have complimented this perfectly i will definitely make this again for a quick easy simple and delicious dessert
5,really good tasting cake but set your timer for minutes for testing if finished ours baked for stuck to the pan and candies on the perimeter im going to try this one again because its delish
5,i followed the recipe exactly as written and the cake turned out beautifully it was light and tasty its not a strong flavored cake but a great light snack or a wonderful dessert with some fruit added to it my husband said that in the words of the great british baking show its a beautiful sponge i will definitely make this cake again sometimes ill make it as is and sometimes ill play around and add flavors to it or a topping of some kind this is a great cake recipe
5,love it so easy and delicious
5,halved the recipe and made it to accompany strawberries and and whipped cream it was excellent not too sweet and nice and moist will definitely use this one again and again
5,this is a real review ive been making this exact recipe for many many years at one time i would bake two to feed my family of seven however with just me and my husband now i cut the recipe in half and use a x pan this is my definite goto recipe for many strawberry shortcake every summerbut love just as much plain out of the oven with powdered sugar sprinkled on top chances are you have every ingredient at home and can whip this up in no time why look for another recipe when youve got the best right here
5,this came out beautiful and fluffy and moist and delicious i am not a professional baker just a hobby from home and had no problems with the recipe and directions i will have to make this over and over again
5,currently on quarantine lockdown and tired of looking at the same walls went to my cupboards and found i had all ingredients on hand i accidentally added teaspoons of vanilla and combined all the dry ingredients out of habit turned out wonderful adding this to regular rotation
5,perfect recipe just follow the procedure and yoi will get a fluffy tasty cake kids so loved it
5,this is a humble cake and it is delicious i have made it numerous times and it comes out perfectly every time i dont understand how it doesnt come out for others i make a could of small tweaks i use unsalted butter for all of my baking so i added a teaspoon of salt and whisked it together with the flour baking power and salt before adding them to the batter i used twice the vanilla also i think it makes a big difference if you add ingredients very gradually make sure an addition of flour is almost completely incorporated before adding the next
5,made this cake today was pretty simple to make served it as a strawberry shortcake i think the cake would also be wonderful to use in a trifle i will save it and make it again
5,my mom has the same recipe but we put chocolate whip cream frosting on it we make it for birthday dinners
5,easy recipe great when fresh strawberries are available or peaches or cherries scrape bowl often when adding flour or milk mixture added teaspoon of grated lemon rind with vanilla nice flavor sister likes it with grated orange rind use nonstick foil in pan grab foil and place on cutting board when done no need to clean a pan
5,damien you made my day your statement that some of these folks just cant cook or bake i am surprised and disappointed at the venom some of these posters spray everyone likes different tastes i dont understand the hatefulness expressed i guess since people cant be identified they feel they can say such hateful things about someones recipe if you do care for a recipe you dont care for it plain and simple move on and try another recipe
5,im not sure what the others did wrong but this is an awesome recipe
5,have been making this for years we love it ive even used leftover spamoniongreen pepper and cheese which we use for a grilled sandwhich
5,this was delicious i made it with ham instead of bacon since that was what i had on hand i also used tator tots and broke them up as that was what i had it needed to cook a bit extra as the tator tots were not completely thawed out it made me nervous at first as it didnt seem to be setting up but i just cooked it til a knife came out clean and it turned out great

5,this is my new favorite breakfast casserole great as written or do as we do and add in other meats amp veggies we have on hand the cottage cheese in it adds creamy goodness
5,i made this on xmas eve to serve xmas morningvery goodit is already slotted for the menu for xmas
5,my husband loved this dish he said it needs to replace our annual tradition of breakfast pie see other taste of home recipe for christmas breakfast
5,looked this up a few days before christmas when seraching for breakfast idaes we really liked this made it for christmas breaksfast for the fisrt time and it had nice presentation for guests very easy to make i reduced the onion used sweet onion because i dont really care for onions i will make again thanks
5,this recipe is the same one i found in a quilters cookbook several years ago i make it all the time i like the sausage but i also use canadian bacon its easier and a little less fat give it a try we like this recipe with pancakes
5,i just tried it and it is amazing however i used selfraising flour and baking powder and it came soft like a chiffon cake simply amazing
5,wow i was very impressed with the texture and taste of this cake it was great served with fresh fruit and next time i may serve it with lemon curd sooo easy
5,made this cake it was great topped it with brown sugar frosting everyone loves it everyone must try brown sugar frosting just cut the powdered sugar in half and it has the perfect amount of sweetness
5,this recipe has become a family favorite im making it today for my daughters nd birthday when i told her she was overjoyed this cake is absolutely delicious no frosting at all its so quick to make that i can throw it into the oven after dinner and have a delicious dessert in no time i dont let it cool too much because we think it tastes best when it is hot
5,my mother made this when i was growing up in the s amp s her recipe is almost exactly the same as this one she filled the layers and topped the cake with what i know now was a thick lemon curd delicious
5,this cake is so easy to make its top off a meal nicely oldfashioned goodness
5,quick and easy to make i used chai instead of milk to turn it into a chai cake i added some spices with the dry ingredients too its a bit sweet so i paired it with a less sweet icing i think cream cheese icing or icing made of instant pudding mix and thickened cream would be nice
5,this is an excellent cake made it just as recipe instructed you need to have oven preheated when making this cake it needs to go into the oven as quickly as possible while the batter is still warm i think it rises better that way
5,good lta href target_blankgtinformationltagt i need deep recipe about this
5,i live in colorado at high altitude
5,loved it nd time i varied the recipe a little more vanilla and tsp salt and instead of milk beat the whites replaced the white volume with water to make the batter folded in the whites its just as delicious but substantially lighter with out losing the creamy ness
5,delicious
5,so gorgeous
5,this cake was a bit too sweet on its own for me maybe i didnt incorporate the sugar enough will definitely try again though as its a great tasting cake with this sweet batch i ended up layering it with thickened cream and coffee and made a tiramisu it was delicious
5,good amazing and fun
5,this is an excellent cake for a pineapple or peach upside own cake not too heavy and it makes enough batter for two cakes or make the second cake into something else like boston cream cake
5,great cake works every time now make it as muffins as everyone wants more makes so enough for everyone
5,simple and delicious simply delicious definitely a keeper i followed this recipe to the t and it is fabulous we will enjoy this for many years to come
5,my mom had made this cake for many many years it was one of her recipes that relatives new she would bring to a shower or to a special family gathering she made a hot brown sugar sauce for the topping on the cake for an after sunday dinner desert or sometimes with boiled frosting we were always wondering when she made it was this cake for us or was it leaving the housecomfort food from our childhood i guess
5,i am and this was my favorite cake growing up this was the base for our strawberry shortcake my mother also made it with a maple fudge frosting which i loved when i started to make it at age my mother couldnt understand why mine always tasted better than hers we found out why years later when i discovered that i had misread her recipe and was adding twice the butter to this day i still misread her recipeyummmmm
5,this is the perfect cake to top with your favorite fruit topping i take it to almost every summer time picnic and it never fails to disappear
5,i got the credit of making a tasty cake
5,delicious easy too i would like to hear about some different frosting ideas for it i did like it plain and also with a little powdered sugar im just curious
5,my grandmother made a cake very similar to this which she topped with fresh strawberries and whipped cream when i saw fresh strawberries on special yesterday at the grocery store i thought of her cake and found this recipe the taste and smell were so familiar the recipe was easy to make and tasted great i also served some of the cake topped with chocolate icing and it was fantastic too this recipe will become a permanent addition to my recipe collection its very versatile and oh so easy and tasty
5,i have been making this cake for over years it is one of my husbands favorites i do use salted butter if you dont have salted butter just add tsp salt and i use tbs of vanilla the mixture is thin but it works perfectly i usually make it in a bundt pan just because we like it that way too thin for a tube pan i like to make this to add to gift baskets use to pint size wide mouth jars grease inside fill about full place on a pan to bake about mins or until touch test works place lids and rings on as soon as you can after removing from the oven they will seal tighten after jars have cooled if sealed they will be good for at months in cabinet enjoyi have tried to give this stars but it just wont let me could be me
5,love homemade milk cake
5,i just made my moms recipe for hot milk cake and decided to search for variations i was reading the reviews and i just wanted to take the time to say please do not follow the advice given by jacksjojo i wish there was a way to report it you cannot can anything with eggs milk or flour even if you could these directions are not an appropriate way of canning just because the lid seals does not mean that is safe you could potentially die of botulism or worse kill someone else when you give it as a gift
5,the first time that i made this cake i used all purpose flour and all i could taste was the flour the cake was dense even though it rose beautifully the second time that i made this cake i used swans down cake flour and it made a huge difference in the flavor and the texture i also used this recipe to make cupcakes i baked them at degrees for exactly minutes and they came out perfect this is going to be my go to recipe every time i make a cake or cupcakes
5,i have made this cake for years as my base for trifle i split the cake in half and place in bottom of glass bowl sprinkle with a liqueur that matches my fruit cover with jam or cooked fruit add pudding and repeat layers then cover with sweetened whipped cream it always disappears quickly
5,this is a great recipe adding some lemon zest gives a nice light lemon taste top with berries and cream or cinnamon and sugar yummmm i love this cake very easy to make and flavor anyway you please
5,loved it very easy to make light amp fluffy
5,great recipe i made it tonight and the cake came out delicious
5,this is to die for i dont know what happened to the others that said this had no flavor as it is so sweet and delicious now i just need some strawberries yum thanks for the fantastic recipe
5,i thought this cake was really easy to make and came out great the texture is both spongy and slightly dense at the same time i followed other reviewers suggestions to add a smidge more vanilla and a pinch of salt i did also add about tsp of rum extract because i thought the batter tasted good but needed a little something you could really use this cake as a base and add any type of extract or flavoring youre in the mood for i also agree with the others who said its very important to beat the eggs for the full minutes maybe even a little longer i also made sure i beat the sugar and eggs until they were nice and airy too minutes in the oven was perfect the cake tastes great on its ownespecially when its still warmbut i plan on serving it with strawberries and fresh whipped cream later cant wait
5,very yummy and so easy i only used amp c sugar and added tsp vanilla and a little salt it has a great consistency thanks for sharing this will be one of our favorites now
5,love the recipe its a keeper will make often and dont see why some people dont like it crazy
5,i followed the instruction exactly like it was written without adding any salt the results were still great though i would agree to add a little salt next time could be as a base for any birthday cake with any thingflavour added spongy and moist at the same time i will make it again for sure
5,we have been making hot milk cakes in our family for more than years it is an easy tasty cake and you can add coco powder cup or more to taste and make a chocolate hot milk cake delicious

5,grandma cake add cinnamon or whatever spice you like
5,i have been making this cake for over years or more it is my daughters favorite and always asked for it for her birthday cake
5,u need to mix the eggs really good and the sugar we loved the cake
5,expellant recipe
5,i never add baking soda or powder to my baked good because it makes it taste like soap so i didnt add it its similar to pound cake very moist
5,this cake is delicious as a snack cake without frosting or topping because it is more dense than regular cake we like to use this recipe for strawberry shortcake it is sooo good
5,i have had this recipe from taste of home years ago and it is a staple in my family it feeds alot of people and everyone loves it i use chives or scallions instead of onion
5,i have made this for christmas morning the last years in a row delicious for breakfast or dinner
5,has anyone ommited the cottage cheese and used something else i have one in the family that if they see cottage cheese they wont use it would ricotta cheese work
5,this recipe is delicious to the person who would like to substitute ricotta instead of cottage cheese that would work fine also but since ricotta is alot more expensive you might consider just putting your cootage cheese through a food processor or blender and your cottage cheese hater will not know the difference
5,being im watching the fat intake i found this recipe easy to defat with turkey bacon and lowfat or no fat cheeses if you dont have frozen hash browns shred or dice the potatoes
5,made this for a bible study brunch and was a huge success the potatoes are a welcomed change from bread and the cottage cheese makes it oh so creamy wouldnt change a thing and will definately make again
5,very good made for faimly
5,i have made this for christmas morning the last two years it is a hit i substitue monterey jack for the swiss and i cook the bacon and onion up the night before and measure out the other ingredients in a large bowl basically do everything except add the eggs i do that in the morning i get it out a few minutes earlier and bake it a little longer works really well
5,we were snowed in and i made this and it is fantastic cannot wait to make it again i used bob evans sausage since i had it on hand and probably used close to cups of shredded hashbrowns to make it firmer my husband and i love it and this is our new favorite breakfast casserole now the next time i will use bacon instead to see if it is as good
5,wow this was great i used extrasharp cheddar cheese my husband and kids loved it thank you for a great recipe i will use a lot
5,my daughter is going back to college this morning and i wanted to make something she would enjoy amp get her back on the road to finish up her last year of college we all enjoyed this very much
5,i made this for our ladies bible study today and everyone luved iti did make a few changes because i needed it to make a lager casserolei used eggs instead of sixmy hashbrowns was a oz bagand i added extra cheddar cheese to the top when it was done and left it just long enough meltwe r big on cheddar cheesewas very goodmight try it another way next time r make as recipe calls i just needed a bigger casserole this morninthanks sharing will be making it again
5,this was very tasty and relatively easy to make made with bacon and next time i will try the breakfast sausage
5,my granny made this cake all the time for my pappy it was from scratch amp made in a pyrex bowl smaller scale but what she did that made it so great was to add while hot the coconut and brown sugar icing while the cake is baking in a pan she melted t butter c brown sugar t milk and to c coconut bring to a boiling point and pour over the warm cake i punch holes in mine to let it seep in heaven i have to tell you that i have looked for this recipe for years and this is as close to my grannys as you can get thank you for the recipe so to those ladies who complained sorry but cake is priceless to me
5,this cake is awesome i did add tsp salt to the recipe amp increased vanilla to about tsp sprinkled with powdered sugar amp served with fresh strawberries and cream unbelievably delicious sometimes i want sweet but not too sweet this does it i like this better than pound cake because its lighter amp softer
5,i think what the reviews with low stars are missing is quality ingredients the first time i made this i made no alterations and it was perfect i topped with some homemade peach marmalade and that added just enough sweetness that coffee goes perfect with it now i do use farm fresh eggs fresh dairy milk and fresh dairy butter so im thinking that that has something to do with it with old recipes it makes a huge difference
5,i tried this recipe and it came out really well i was short of egg but the outcome was still good thanks for sharing
5,this is a great cake very moist and flavorful it does need to cook longer than the directions say at least in my oven dont rely on the toothpick test or it wont be cooked it should spring back if you touch it the top should be golden brown and then its done i used boiled peanut butter frosting which was more like fudge it was for a family birthday party and it disappeared fast
5,literally just finished cooking it definately came out light and fluffy inlove with this cake already added blue food colouring to make it a little different and after reading some reviews i ended up adding salt and it came out perfect thanks to everyone for their reviews it really made the cake work
5,when youre raising kids you need lots of delicious inexpensive recipes to fill up all those tummies this recipe was one of our familys favorites when all the kids were growing up so easy to top it with fruit to make it a little more special but everyone loved it just as it is easy to make amp delicious

5,i have made this cake on several occassions and it is a fantastic cake its halfway between a sponge and a pound cake its also a great base for cakes as suggested by others i cannot believe some people think its an awful cake i have suggested this recipe to many people when they comment on how nice it is definitely worth a try
5,i searched out this recipe because its an old favourite of my husbands his mom made it often and he missed it he loved this and said it was even better than his moms you have to know what kind of untouchable reputation his mom has in his mind for baking to know what compliment this is lol the only thing i didnt different was use lemon extract instead of vanilla and made a simple glaze with lemon zest in it i think that the people that have bad reviews maybe over heated the milk which destroys the entire cake
5,just baked this cake and my husband loved it it was very easy to make and delicious too
5,great cake just like mother used to make
5,made this cake yesterday very easy to make and is absolutely delicious i served it with strawberries and my husband loved it i will be making this one again

5,always requested by my children for their birthdays since it first came out in toh in truly delicious especially hot out of the oven i look forward to making it for my grandchildren someday if youre looking for something especially sweet this isnt it to me this is more like the flavor of a shortbread cookie great with a hot cup of tea as one reviewer commented
5,i used to make this as a teenager because it was so eash to make and always turned out well my problem was that the batter was so good i would eat a lot of it before it ever hit the oven
5,i just finished making this recipe and its definitely going to become my goto cake recipe i cut the recipe in half and used a x glass dish and cut off like minutes of baking time and i am so pleased with the results a perfect spongy cake very easy to make and not time consuming at all

5,i have been looking for a recipe that fits the picture description of this cake for quite some time firm fine crumb spongy soft texture and this recipe delivered it is fantastic worked as a cake worked as cupcakes i have pages of yellow cake recipes and this one immediately has jumped to page i do have a question does anyone have baking times for baking and round versions my first attempt at a round was still not done after minutes and unfortunately i could not leave it baking any longerany advice would be appreciatedthanks again for the great recipe
5,i did a demo in high school home ec on this cake my recipe is very close to this years ago and i still make it the ingred are usually on hand its fast and wonderful with fruit it is so adaptable i have added plain blueberries to it serve with fresh strawberries and whip cream instead of those dry round things your family will never want to go back i have also used pinapple cooked with small amount of sugar and cornstarch for a great topping cooled it and then top with whip cream and sprinkle with coconut my recipe makes a smaller cake and only uses c flour t baking powder t salt t butter c hot milk i use buttermilk eggs c sugar and t vanilla directions same except for x pan degrees for min just the right size for a small quick dessert for fresh fruit
5,glorious so simple and so good a real discovery moist tasty great consistency and it keeps great i suspect the time invested beating the eggs paid off thanks a lotand to those considering whether to bake it or not do it there is no going back
5,great tasting old fashioned textured cakeplain or dusted with powdered sugar and fruit toppingdelish
5,i made this cake for my husbands birthday when i read the recipe i was skeptical as i had never heard of hot milk cake i decided to try it because of all the great reviews it was a bit more work than my usual yellow cake recipe but it was well worth it this is the fluffiest cake i have ever made it was moist and light i followed the recipe exactly i think that beating the eggs for the full five minutes is essential i made two x cakes and froze one for another day i served the other one with fresh strawberries and light whipped cream my husband raved about it this is my new favourite cake recipe
5,great recipe i like light fluffy cakes so i added some more baking powder and add a little baking soda
5,very tasty cake will make again and again next time i would like to try a little cinnamon in it also very tasty dunked into hot chocolate my son wants to try putting a little cocoa in it yum cant wait to try many different ideas

5,ive been making this cake for years since i got the recipe from another poster on a cooking forum i used it as my wedding cakeit is not as light and fluffy as cake mix cakes and does have somewhat the consistency of pound cake i like that and it makes it sturdy enough for stacking and decorating multiple layersbe sure to beat the eggs the full minutes called for or it will be extremely dense

5,moist amp delicious hot milk cake recipe i baked it in a jelly roll pan amp it turned out great
5,absolutley love the flavour of this cake my first try turned out more like a pound cake probably because i may have overmixed when adding the hot milk mixture to the flour but as i like a heavier density cake i am ok with that i will definitely make again
5,moist delicious and easy to make cake i will definitely make this cake again
5,my husband had had this cake as a child and wanted me to find a recipe so i turned to toh he loved this when i made it and said it was even better than he recalled it it was moist light and airy very very good with or without frosting

5,i made this as a test to see if its what i wanted to take to a bridal shower it was great i did follow the advice of one lady and made it with eggs and oz hash browns so it would be a little bigger being from the southwest you cant make an egg dish without throwing in green chili i bought the frozen kind and drained it before adding since it was bigger i baked it an hour

5,i loved the flavor and texture of this salad not too sweet or too much vinegar which is a common issue i have with coleslaws the ratio of dressing to slaw is perfect i didnt have to make any changes to get it right stars
5,love this cake it was in the first issue of taste of home and it has been a staple in my home both my boys love it
5,this is the best cake i have ever had the ingredients are simple and readily available recipe is easy to make

5,this is my favorite cake since my family loves it i am making it today for my th birthday tomorrow love it
5,my mther called this a hot milk sponge cake we had it with strawberries every summer for years its fantastic
5,great recipe i make this a lot when im having a crowd for dinner start out with a very large bowli made a mistake in not realizing how much this makes and had to change bowls three times for everything to fit the dressing is outstanding
5,this salad is a winner i used a package of broccoli carrot and cabbage mix and red pepper in place of the green i also added craisins an used maria callen
5,super salad wondered what i was going to do with the case of kraft macaroni and cheese i bought from costco because it had been wonderful when i was seven along with spagetti os i obviously didnt grow up in a household where mom liked to cook anyway the kraft noodles were just the right size i like sweet dressings so bottled poppyseed or the recipe from joans broccoli madness go great the packages of three color coleslaw make this super quick
5,made this at camp was a huge hit
5,i used farfalle noodles i like it
5,this is one of my familys favorite salads and i make it quite often during the summer but we do have it yearround so easy to prepare and it does make a lot definitely a keeper
5,this is my goto recipe for a great picnic salad ive brought it to campouts backyard bbqs pot lucks and ive made it for just me and my family its simple and absolutely delicious
5,when reading this recipe mixing pasta and coleslaw seemed a bit odd to me we like pasta salad and we like coleslaw but together just didnt seem right i stand corrected it is quite tasty and i will definitely be making it again i did swapped out mayonnaise for the miracle whip recipe does make a large amount
5,absolutely delicious i love this recipe this is of my favorite parts of summer coleslaw and pasta salad i never thought of putting them together this was an instant favorite in my house the only change i made was i grated fresh carrots and used fresh cabbage
5,ive made this for almost all summer potlucks for a few years and everyone loves it even people who claim to dislike miracle whip it does make a huge batch but my friends ask to take some home when there are leftovers and my picky husband will eat it for days
5,left out cucumber and used mayo instead it makes alot so it was perfect for neighborhood get together everyone loved will make again
5,i would make this again quite a nice salad enjoyed by my family tasty combination of coleslaw and macaroni salad good dressing used mayo i typically dont purchase bagged coleslaw i shredded cabbage and carrots i left out the cucumbers
5,really like this make it very often hard to find whole water chestnuts so i use sliced and cut them in half i usually take the seeds out of the cucumbers with small scoop but probably not necessary this is great for pot lucks
5,you know the recipe is good when you bring home an empty bowl and people ask for the recipe
5,i found this a very pleasing salad and have made it twice now the first time i stuck to the recipe and found it sweet but the vinegar also played off that sweetness the second time i cut the sugar while i thought it was still very good there was something to be said for the sweet against the tang either way it is good
5,yummy makes a large batch i do not care for miracle whip on sandwiches but figured the sweet flavor would work well in a coleslaw and it does i used of a small vidalia onion rather than whole onions seeded the cucumber before dicing it used the suggested sugar and thinned the dressing with a little milk i cut up the coleslaw mix into smaller pieces and wilted it combined coleslaw mix with the salt placed it in a colander and pressed the mix with a weighted plate for about an hour or so before combining with remaining ingredients this is a wonderful potluck dish anyone who likes coleslaw should enjoy this recipe
5,ive made this twice now and it is always a hit it has quickly become a family favorite perfect for a potluck
5,this is very good my husband really liked it and described it as fresh i used light mayo of a larger red onion and no water chestnuts nice make ahead salad the dressing was lighter than i expected a good thing maybe the light mayo
5,excellent i used regular mayo nice mix of pasta and coleslaw great dressing
5,thanks for the inspiration i changed it up a bit and used red onion green and red bell peppers skipped the cucumber and water chestnuts i also cheated and used maries coleslaw dressing to make this in a pinch lastly i added craisins this served a crowd and the combo of crunchy slaw and pasta was delicious next time ill try the homemade dressing
5,this is really good and makes a substantial amount for a pot luck im wondering about adding tuna cooked chicken ham pepperoni or maybe even cooked shrimp for a summertime luncheon meal i also like that one other poster added dried cranberries
5,absolutely delicious perfect for a potluck i do think it would be great with tunachicken etc will definitely be making again
5,i made this as directed including using miracle whip for a potluck everyone loved it being a hellmanns lover thats what i used the next time i made it big mistake it didnt taste the same so for now on its miracle whip
5,i made this recipe but halved it since there were only two of us it was absolutely delicious sweet and tangy and the pasta fit right in i was unsure how it was going to be i loved this and would make it again
5,i made this tonight but cut it in half for the two of us i couldnt find the water chestnuts and i added red pepper along with green really really good
5,we loved this recipe i am going to try it and add some dungeness crab or shrimp and make it a dinner
5,made this last year times and everyone loved it the water chestnuts are in the asian food section they really add a great crunch i used mayo dont like miracle whip i make the day before
5,sooo very good even better next day made for a friend of mine and she said the same things about it oh and my husband also i may even try to add some finely chopped broccoli to it also
5,man this salad was awesome i knew i would like it because of the ingredients but when my husband whose system cant tolerate lettuce took a fork of it and liked it i was definitely sold to top off the flavors i added raisins and it was a show stopper
5,i wouldnt adjust anything and typically i am a mayonnaise fan this recipe is so tasty i will definitely copy it and put in my old fashioned recipe box as a keeper thanks
5,i was so surprised at how good this is i made it for a church potluck i was not so sure about it with the peppers and cucumbers but would not change this in anyway
5,this is delicious and makes enough for quite a good sized group people love it when i bring it to a potluck
5,omg this is so good instantly became a new family favorite will definitely be making this often over the summer and all year through excellent
5,excellent salad even better with cubed cheddar cheese addedgives it more flavor
5,i love salads like this except that now its almost impossible to find the little ring noodles last time i needed them i had to order them from amazon what is up with that
5,this recipe is a big hit at any gathering i added a little shredded cheddar cheese and bacon bits and it was a big hit
5,new favorite salad
5,if you substitute tarragon vinegar for the cider vinegar this dish goes to the next level
5,wonderful summer salad i used mayo
5,i have been making this for years minus the water chestnuts i am often requested to bring my funeral salad to church when a luncheon is being served following a funeral it is so well liked ill try adding the water chestnuts next time
5,excellent recipe a little different than the traditional cabbage salad i use mayonnaise and tarragon vinegar joyce moynihan volunteer field editor
5,what a tasty combination who doesnt like cole slaw or macaroni salad this is my new go to recipe for pot lucks funeral receptions and family gatherings i omit the water chestnuts as they dont seem to offer much taste and there is plenty of crunch without them i also have begun substituting maries cole slaw dressing refrigeration section of grocery store in that i believe it has just the right tang this has been a popular salad wherever ive brought it thank you sandra for sharing a real winner
5,not a fan of cole slaw but love this salad the crunch from the veggies and adding the pasta make it so good my new favorite summertime salad
5,really enjoyed
5,ive made the recipe many times as writtenit is very good everyone wants the recipe its so nice to give a great review to the actual recipenot how its been modified into something totally different
5,hubby made this for a company healthy living salads contest and i was lucky to get a cup to try he used fullfat miracle whip and packaged precooked rigatoni that he chopped up which was a little chewier than homemade he cut the onion to one and used a mild onion the chopping is a chore to say the least but he likes doing putzy stuff like that using sliced water chestnuts would trim some of the time off since he made it the night before the dressing and onions had time to mellowexchanges id make in the future would be half miracle whip and half yogurt trying plain and then lemon for salad meal id add add cheese cubes ham chicken summer sausage that lonely hotdog and sunflower or pumpkin seeds maybe whole grain pasta fresh or frozen peas maybe pineapple tidbits or tomatoesthis was good as is but can be used as a base to expand ingredients
5,i make this for my club meetings i use a vidalia chop wizard it makes it easy to chop up everything the bowl always comes home empty everyone including myself seems to really like it thank you so much for a good recipe
5,my husband and i really enjoyed this recipe we are not miracle whip fans so i did substitute mayonnaise i also cut the recipe back quite a bit for the two of us this recipe is a nice twist on traditional coleslaw and i will definitely be making it again
5,i doubled recipe and my husband took it to his weekly softball gamepotluck he just came home with the huge bowl completely empty i followed the recipe except used best foods mayo and added celery salt instead of regular salt also added a bit of colemans dry mustard and celery seed like i would have for my usual coleslaw anyhow it was obviously a big hit this might be my weekly potluck contribution from now on i wish i did not work on game days
5,i made this for a baby shower and everybody raved about how good it was i added fresh dill lots intimation crab of the onion and red onion instead of yellow and i used mayonnaise
5,a fresh salad pasta adds a new twist
5,is that amp cups or just cup of miracle whip light cups miracle whip light
5,this is such a different take on either a coleslaw or a macaroni salad the best of both worlds i didnt change a thing and i really like the miracle whip dressing
5,we dont like water chestnuts but wanted that crunch factor so we added a chopped up apple instead try it
5,this was a great recipe the only change was substituting mayonnaise for the miracle whip everyone loved it no leftovers
5,sooooooo good i had to go out and get the miracle whip even though i had mayo made it and it was all gone in a couple of days and its only my husband and i i did decrease the sugar a little just because i dont like slaw that sweet but this will definitely be made over and over again
5,something a little different but so tasty i halved the recipe but next time will make a full batch was wellreceived at our barbecue
5,after i made this recipe i havent even triedanother one this is a keeper

5,this recipe always gets rave reviews and requests for the recipe its a new summer favorite for our family
5,i have not made this yet but on my menu for th of july miracle whip sells everywhere and is made by kraft
5,this recipe was a real hit when i made for my family it has become a favourite at potlucks as well
5,just made this today and we loved it my husband is originally from nd so i knew it had to be good
5,i made this dish for a birthday party yesterday and it was a big hit everyone was asking for the recipe i used a mixture of red and green pepper did not use water chestnuts and added real bacon pieces i did not use the dressing mixture i used a whole jar of maries coleslaw dressing which is awesome will be making this dish again
5,this is a great recipe since my husband is vegetarian i used bacon flavored olive oil to saute the onion and carrots then i used veggie bullion instead of chicken and replaced the ham with sliced litelife italian sausage my entire family actually prefers the veggie version
5,great taste quick amp and easy next time ill use a little less cheese
5,the best soup ever so very full of flavor and is often requested by my mother daughter amp grandson i would prepare meals for myself then take half to my year old mother and she so loved this soup that she requested it at least once a month i ran out of cheese once and it is great even without the cheese i moved mother in with me when she was diagnosed with terminal cancer and she eventually got to the point she could no longer chew i would then blend this soup so she could just swallow and still have the nourishment now that she has passed i always think of her when i make this as this was her favorite im sure that once you make this soup it would be requested by your family and become your favorite too
5,this recipe was absolutely amazing i am going to have to double it next time because my husband and two sons almost didnt leave me any so flavorful and satisfying i used chicken broth instead of bouillon and water its definitely going into the rotation thank you
5,make this soup it is absolutely delicious my husband not a fan of soup even asked if i could make it regularly the flavors and texture were perfect i normally never use bouillon but did in this recipe and it was fine this is a real winner
5,yep everyone was right this was delicious and absolutely worth making i am sure i will be making this again whenever i have leftover ham
5,this soup is delish rich and thick i often will substitute half and half or heavy cream for part of the milk its a very forgiving soup for substitutions bbutleri have frozen it without any problem
5,excellent and easy chock full of flavor and texture i used half the bacon and it was great i did add some diced celery
5,this is always a hit in our house the kids and i made one summer evening a while back and we now make it about every month or so we add a freshly cracked black pepper and sometimes throw in some celery even add croutons when serving great hearty dish
5,how could you go wrong with ham and bacon sounds good to me i added two sticks of chopped celery grated my carrots and used red potatoes i had one cup of heavy cream i wanted to use up so i made the difference with the whole milk i also had pieces of frozen bacon ready to add it was like a stew thick and good and we liked it that way yummy
5,i wish i could save these changes without a review because i really dislike when people change a recipe and still review it since toh doesnt have the option to make notes here goes i made this heart healthy by deleting the bacon and sautéing the onion and carrot in olive oil after that i added chicken that i had baked separately and used milk and reduced fat cheese i followed all of the other directions my family loved it
5,with all of the toh soup recipes lately i cannot believe they havent included this one it is absolutely fantastic i have been making it since i first saw it in the toh magazine years ago i do use much finer chopped onions practically minced and smaller pieces of ham but i dont change anything as far as ingredients you can use canned potatoes and carrots if you are crunched for time but how disappointing that the editors have not included this recipe in the all of the soup recipes with two posts about the best soups how could this one not make it maybe i missed it anyway this recipe if a keeper yum
5,this has been a family favorite for probably years i dont really change anything the only adjustment i made is that i now use chicken broth instead of water and bouillon and i use skim milk instead of whole milk just because it is what we drink it makes a thinner soup which is fine but the original recipe is probably better but still great flavor either way i also quit measuring everything i just add as much or as little of everything that i want always good its hard to screw up
5,i used miracle whip for the salad dressing and it was great this is my new favorite summertime salad
5,loved this chowder my husband said to be sure and keep this recipe it did take longer for the potatoes to cook so prep time was quite a bit longer i did remove some of the bacon grease and it still thickened fine will definitely make again
5,made this last night so we can come home to it for dinner today its very yummy and tasty however it came out pretty thick a little thicker than we wanted what do you gals suggest i add to it to cut the thickness water or milk
5,my family asks for this recipe often it is easy and delicious nothing is better on a cold winter day i serve with a green salad and good homemade bread
5,oh this is so very good keeper it has kinds of pork potatoes lots of veggiescreamy cheesy sweet corny goodness in a bowl rich
5,ive been making this for a couple of years now and it is wonderful we love it
5,i make this several times in the fall and winter served with biscuits or cornbread it makes a hearty dinner on cold evenings
5,delicious will start adding this to our dinner rotation
5,this was a very good soup my family really enjoyed it it was a very simple recipe to make
5,you will want more than one cup for a serving even children love this one
5,this is a very tasty soup the ham and bacon combination really put it over the top one of our favorite potato soups i have tried
5,this was good the first day but the second day it was awesome after the flavors had time to meld a hearty delishious soup i used
5,my family loves this recipe its absolutely delicious
5,use frozen diced hash browns to speed up prep time
5,this was a great hit at a big family gettogether will make it again and again
5,i did id not have bacon so used butter to saute veggies added cup celery because i like it this was excellent and very filling i did notice that when reheated is was much thinner but still tasty will be making again soon
5,very good easy to make especially with leftover easter ham not low calorie by any means
5,absolutely delicious wouldnt change a thing
5,this was amazing i love my soups a little on the thick side and this one fit the bill the flavors were perfect did not change a thing thanks for the recipe
5,my kids and their friends now call this halloween soup because i make it every halloween as adults my kids still come over in october and request this soup i always have to make a double batch with extra bacon so satisfying
5,i had never made a soup like this very good will make it again
5,this recipe made me want to sign up after trying multiple others over the past few monthsif you havent made it yet make itthe author is a culinary genious i love iti removed the carrots and onions and added some garlic powder as well as some extra ham but this recipe is fantastic however you like it its open to customization but if you like the vegetables theres no way you can go wrong here if you like garlic i would definitely recommend adding a light amount of it dont overdo it the flavors in this dish shouldnt be overthrown by the garlic
5,not that this recipe needs another star review but this truly is a delicious chowder i avoid chowders because theyre usually way too thick and heavy this was neither just a perfect balance i used milk and reduced sodium chicken broth for the liquids and i added celery and thyme as suggested by other reviewers i will make this again
5,made this soup for the first time and it wont be the last it is truly great tasting
5,awesome chowder super easy to make and delicious
5,delicious chowder that i will definitely prepare for my family again next fallwinter the only thing i did differently was add fresh garlic
5,kids love this i make it at least twice a month regardless of what time of year it is the only thing i do different is add more flour oh and minus the carrots because gross because the kids like it a bit thicker so delicious its one of my go to recipes made it so many times i dont even need the recipe anymore you wont be disappointed
5,our son loved this soup
5,this recipe was awesome my family
5,used chicken stock for the water and added thyme and garlic powder to taste wow what a great chowder
5,i made this for the first time last night took a little longer than i thought but my family loved it even my picky yr old will definitely make it again
5,this was really good though i did make some minor changes i used frozen thawed country style hash browns so easy since theyre already diced i added a bit more flour to make it thicker i used chicken broth in place of water i added thyme rosemary
5,i thought it was amazing and full of flavor probably my favorite chowder recipe to make
5,omg i have made this soup weeks in a row amp my family want it again tomorrow for sunday diner since we are all dieting i put in zucchini instead of potatoes even my little grandchildren love this
5,great way to use up leftover ham
5,i am so happy i found this recipe so simple quick and delicious my family loved this and asked when i could make it again the only downfall is i didnt find this recipe sooner
5,great soup i did cut back on the amount of bacon grease i used seemed like a lot used milk it was fine my finished soup was a little thick so i added a little chicken broth until it was perfect
5,i make something very similar to this and my crew loves it only difference is i use chicken broth instead of the bouillon and no bacon good stuff
5,outstanding recipe i used smoked ham steaks used white pepper and followef a recommendation of adding thyme i also used ham stock insteak of the recommended chicken bouillon tossed two diced stalks of celery in with the onions and carrots and minced a couple cloves of garlic i also used half and half in place of the milk ill make this a couple times every fallwinter great flavor even though its thick oyster crackers work well
5,this was great and the whole family enjoyed the pickiest grandson asked for seconds a first for him thanks so much will make again soon
5,omg what a delicious soup my husband wanted a soup the other day and a knew i printed this and ive been trying to make for a while it turned out to be so hearty thick sweet tasty soup the yums and mmhh were as loud as the clinking spoons on every bowl i used beef bouillon instead of chickenout of stock lol the potatoes carrots and corn are perfect match the bacon turns out to be almost difficult to notice but you can still taste it perfecta
5,fantastic even my year old twins who are not soup people proclaimed this the best soup theyve ever had
5,fantastic i included several minced garlic cloves along with the carrots amp onion and sauteed in chicken broth as i used precooked bacon also used half evaporated milk and half milk lastly i used ham soup baseseasoning as alternative to the chicken bouillonsome may find it somewhat thickhearty very easy to thin with chicken broth
5,made this for dinner tonight and its very good i didnt have bacon so i added some extra ham i will definitely make this again
5,simply delicious it only needs a couple tb of bacon grease also you should add a dash or of sageor thyme and a dash of garlic powder these additions make it perfect
5,wonderful chowder although dont use packaged shredded cheese it curdles still tastes fab but doesnt present as well a definite keeper
5,supper good i like to make a recipe as written the first time i make itthe second time i made this i thought i would lighten it up its to goodto eat just a cup of so i used smoked ham with no bacon pet milk anwater for milk and half as much cheese added cups celery andmade some creamed corn to add as well as the whole corn one tblspflour instead of still very good and i think it was alot less calories iused home canned corn and never add sugar to it when i can it
5,very delicious and easy a nice hearty soup
5,that was really good i used half the cheese im sure you could add a few spices oe vwggies to change it up but this is definitely going into rotation for the winter
5,my husband loves chowder i have never attempted to make it because he is so particular about it my kids and husband loved this i was just trying to find a way to use some leftover christmas ham and stumbled upon a star dish for my family no easy task
5,this is so good how can anyone think its boring satisfying amp comfort food at its best every time i make it someone wants the recipe made it for a party amp handed out or copies i use turkey bacon from a local shop only slices since there is plenty of ham i also use whatever cheese i have on hand its good with mexican or mont jack mixes you can use more vegs i tweak it every time i make it according to whats in the fridge very forgiving recipe thanks
5,i wasnt feeling well so i cut a lot of corners here and it still came out great and my kids liked it too i used canned everything potatoes carrots corn peas and skipped the bacon and onion and we were short on cheese so i used a half jar of cheese wiz dont judge very tasty soup thanks for sharing this very adaptable recipe
5,i skipped the bacon as well and used a couple glugs of olive oil to saute the vegetables the chowder turned out great lots of prep time and cook time with the layering of ingredients to the pot but its worth it delicious and great consistency without heavy cream
5,phenomenal
5,i made this tonight with leftover ham from easter my husband loved the sweetness of the corn and the saltiness of the ham i cut this recipe in half and used skim milk it turned out great goes well with homemade corn bread
5,this chowder is fantastic thick and creamy and just plain yummy i used milk and it worked just fine also being a ham fanatic added a bit more ham just love this as did my husband the chef in our house
5,made this for some company and it was a big hit even though i cooked it for the full time and let it stand before serving the very center had not set up fully but that wont stop me from serving this dish regularly
5,i made this for an employee breakfast at work today and it was hit
5,i put my own spin on this recipe i didnt use the bacon but instead use ham and added mushrooms and used cheddar cheese i made it for company and everyone enjoyed
5,i made this for breakfast for the th of july and it was fantastic it was super easy and really enjoyable i did make one substitution i dont like cottage cheese i dont even like the idea of cottage cheese so i used ricotta cheese instead and it was perfect this is a recipe to keep
5,made this for a family brunch and divided into pans wbacon and without for a vegetarian and both were a big hit i followed various peoples suggestions substituted cottage cheese with ricotta and used half mexican cheese and half mexican cheese with taco seasoning for a little kick very easy to make and yummy
5,simply delicious have made this several times and its always a huge hit i always add extra meat sausage and canadian bacon i never have leftovers
5,i made it first time the way the recipe suggests for a breakfast with my son and grandchildren it was well received the basic rescipe lends itself to variations of your choice so ive used smoke cured ham bulk breakfast sausage smoked sausages and even crabmeat and shrimp i added fresh sliced mushrooms red bellpeppers and even the long green chile peppers seeded and diced small i made fresh salsa with cilantro and served it on the side ialso made fresh biscuits with butter and honey and a fresh fruit or melon great breakfast
5,easy and great tasting and the kids all like it
5,this is the recipe that i use to feed a hungry crowdwhen i made it the first time i followed the recipe to the letter it was wonderfulover time the only changes that i make is that i use eggs instead of just i have also made it using breakfast sausage in place of the bacon i imagine it would be good with ham too yum
5,didnt have swiss so just used cheddar and added green peppers very tasty all the kids and hubby liked it we made it for supper with a little left over the kids want the left overs for breakfast
5,although this recipe was great as is i added more eggs and substituted smoked gouda cheese for the swiss and that really put it over the top
5,i have been using this recipe from toh for years and we still love it i do change it up sometimessausage instead of bacon add green chilies different cheeseits always great i do always have to bake it a little longer than called for and i let it stand a little longer than called for alsoif we can wait that long to dig in it
5,this was great i would add a couple more eggs but even without doing that this was great as in it was all gone with no leftovers
5,excellent soup we served it to ten and not one complaint definitely worth making again
5,perfect way to use leftover ham from easter because i have to be gluten free i subbed cornstarch for the flour for my taste there was too much cheese and next time i will cut it down to c or less that is a personal preference this is a hearty soup and is delicious thank you to whomever submitted it
5,this is so good you will be happy you made it small changes i used four strips of turkey bacon and less cheese i cant wait to have left overs yummers
5,great use for leftover ham rich hardy soup
5,made this last night after seeing the recipe oh boy was this ever good with six kids still at home and it pleased each one of them two different things i did i did not add bacon didnt have it next i used deli ham sliced into small pieces this is a keeper recipe
5,good flavor my kids loved it
5,best and easiest chowder recipe ive come across add ground beefturkey instead of ham and bam you have cheeseburger chowder love this recipe both ways kid friendly my year old niece loved it used white cheddar cheezits for crackers and they give it an extra umph
5,absolutely delicious whole family enjoyed it it reheats very well
5,delicious soup a great way to get my vegetablehating husband to eat cooked carrots its a wonderful winter soup filling amp tasty
5,tasty amp easy to make
5,i made this the other day and it was wonderful i substituted one cup of milk for one cup of halfandhalf it made a much richer soup i also used chicken broth instead of the granules and water i then served it with the taste of home recipe for bread machine garlic bread it was a great combination
5,ceejay you can use chicken bouillon cubes or chicken stock or chicken broth i always use cubes with perfect results hope this helps as for the chowder i havent tried this exact recipe but i gave it stars because i have been making something similar for many years and it is wonderful
5,make sure you use quality cheese for a good cheese flavor it was delicious
5,this recipe scared me at first however i am a big fan of consistent five star reviews so i tried it then i saw the residual grease from the bacon and i was worried id find a grease puddle at the top of the soup bowl i stuck with the recipe not changing a thing since it was the first time trying itit was yummy hearty rich flavorful not dietary but it was after christmas and i used leftover ham very good
5,outstanding chowder i made this for the first time following the recipe exact however i did omit the cheddar cheese i felt this was rich enough without it and still found this to be fabulous
5,this was really delicious i did make some very subtle changes instead of water and bullion i used chicken broth and increased it from cups to cups i found it just too thick at the provided ratios i didnt have corn on hand so i upped the carrots and potatoes and also threw in a bit of diced celery and also added a bay leaf during the saut and no cheddar on hand so i used gouda i think any cheese or mix of cheeses would be wonderfulthis is true comfort food and i think a great base recipe for any number of variations
5,loved this soup a meal in itself
5,omg this is so good full of flavorthis is such a keeper my kids will love this when they come home in the winter months
5,great for lunch on a very cold day
5,we loved the flavor and the consistency it was really easy to make
5,couldnt find my potato soup recipe so i decided to give this a try because it looked pretty close i will no longer be looking for the other recipe because this one was even better plus it calls for cheddar which beats all the velveeta in the old recipe
5,this recipe was easy and delicious we made it last night for dinner definite keeper to make again on a chilly winter night i was slightly confused on the cheese because cups would be ounces but the recipe says ouncesi used oz bags and it was fine im not sure in our house there is such a thing as too much cheese
5,the whole family loved this great for those cold winter days
5,made this tonight for dinner it has been snowing all day and sounded like it was worth a try it was fantastic dinner will definitely make again super easy to make
5,great soup tasted just liked scalloped potatoes and ham i also used chicken broth instead of the water and bullion was afraid it would curdle while waiting for the potatoes to cook but it didnt i will make again thanks
5,i made this for my daughter soninlaw and grand daughter who is and they absolutely loved it its a keeper recipe for sure i changed a couple of things like i do to every recipe i didnt have cups of shredded cheddar cheesei had an oz block of pepper jack i grated and some pepper velveeta slices about i used i added some thinly sliced celery and or finely chopped garlic cloves with the onions and carrots i had some whipping cream i needed to use so i used about cups percent milk and c whipping cream i used about cups of potatoes because my kids love the potatoes and used about cups of ham served it with some mile high homemade biscuits and they all three pigged out
5,this is one of my favorite soupchowder recipesperfect exactly like it is written no changes needed
5,oh my all the raves about this soup are true delicious creamy and hearty love the cubed ham and crumbled crisp bacon the stock itself is flavorful and rich its like a loaded potato soup but with extra cheese as the base even my two young picky kiddos age and gobbled this up and asked for seconds will make this a normal part of our rotation thanks for posting
5,delicious my first time cooking soup from scratch made me look like a pro i changed a few thingsadded c of half and half increased flour to tbsp left bacon and ham in for the simmering stage and increased the quantity of ham to cups topped with additional sprinkle of cheese amazing thank you for this wonderful recipe it will be a favorite in this family forever
5,thank you all for the comments and reviews about my soup recipe it is still a family favorite at my house now that the weather is turning cooler i cant wait to make it again for supper
5,my boyfriend and i made this tonight for the first time and id have to say its the best chowder ive ever had
5,definately a star but still needs a little something i will try next time with some celery perhaps family did like it
5,this was outstanding will make again i served it with corn bread which made it the perfect meal on a rainy fall day
5,made this tonight and i will make it again yummy
5,this is the recipe that officially got me into my motherinlaws good graces so so good
5,this is fantastic i added some broccoli for a little more veggies its very filling and it reheats well
5,made this soup tonight following the recipe very closely and it was delicious ill definitely will make this again only change i made was to use cups chicken broth instead of cup water plus bouillon i dont keep bouillon in the house
5,this is by far one of my favorite meals from taste of home this is how i got hooked when a meal says stars they arent lying they truly are stars delicious meal wouldnt change a thing use cabot seriously sharp cheddar cheese
5,this recipe is not only delicious but also versatile follow the basics but you can vary the veggies tonight i added diced zucchini i cut back a bit on the bacon amp cheese but its still great what a wonderful recipe for a chilly night
5,i am not a big fan of ham chowders but my husband loved this ill keep it in my recipe box for him
5,my whole family loves this chowder its definitely comfort food at our house in winter love the idea of adding different veggies will try that next time
5,this was the best chowder ive ever had nothing is more comforting or says home cooked like this hearty meal if you are looking for a chowder recipe do yourself a favour and look no further make this chowder right now i i only wish i had had a biscuit to top it off
5,almost like a dip it is so rich little goes a long way
5,i wouldnt drain the corn down the sink but into measuring cup then add water to make the cups of water required use this juice for extra flavor this is one of the best chowders i have ever made thank you
5,very good chowder i used cheddar cheese soup with cup of cheddar cheese instead of the cups of cheddar cheese i also used canned potatoes and canned carrots my husband loved it so much that he wants me to make it again
5,this chowder was delicious as do most of the taste of home subscribers i made a couple of changes we cant seem to resist doing that can we i used low sodium chicken broth in place of the water and chicken bouillon granuals to reduce the sodium content and i didnt have cheddar so i used a combination of colby jack and a couple slices of velveeta because that was what i had on hand i also used less bacon to reduce the fat content still an excellent chowder
5,the very best chowder ever friends loved it too and we all will be making it many times nice big batch for company didnt change a thing
5,this is fantastic and simple to put together it is in my menu planner so i can access it whenever the mood strikes
5,made this the other night and the family loved it my husband and sons worked outside all day freezing out that day so they were happy to come home to hot chowder i did shred my own cheese like some recommended made homemade dinner rolls to go with it the only thing i will change next timeis to make a double batch thanks jennifer for a great recipe
5,absolutely delicious and so hearty and comforting on one of these first really cold days of late fall i added more corn and potatoes than it called for and it got a big thumbs up from my husband who is a big guy and loves ribsticking comfort food
5,i didnt change a thing and it was delicious perfect for fall and winter
5,absolutely delish wonderful cheesy ham flavor creamy and soothing to the palate a sure keeper that i will make consistently
5,this chowder was rich thick and hearty and awesome flavor stick to your ribs meal in itself
5,wow this is the best chowder recipe i have ever cooked i tasted it before i had added the cheese and it was great even with out it i followed the recipe exactly i had the chowder on low while we ate it and it did curdle up a bit with the cup of cheese it was great but will try cups of cheese the next time i cook this thank you for a great recipe
5,this is my favorite soup recipe now it is delicious
5,ive been making this for years and its one of our favorite dishes over the years i have played with it now i add vermouth to the roux and different spices that we like i use turkey bacon which works fine with the addition of a little olive oil
5,this is the second recipe i tried for a ham and potato soup and my family loved this one i cooked it in the crockpot though added all the ingredients at once i didnt have bacon on hand so skipped it and my family still loved it so next i will add bacon to see the difference
5,my family loves this chowder i added some extra cheese
5,it is wonderful i was wondering if anyone has tried freezing it
5,this is one of my favorite soups i just made it this week it was wonderful
5,toothfairylin try adding the cheese to the white sauce created with the milk flour etc instead of at the end i have a similar recipe and it works great
5,easy to make amp a way to use left over corn from a previous meal i added some celery which gave it some green vegetables without changing the taste
5,this is for toothfairylin the answer to your question is are you using cheese that is already shredded i found this out the hard way when i was trying a recipe that needed shredded cheese if you buy the cheese already cut up or shredded they add flour to it so it doesnt stick together also you dont really know how long that bag of sheese has been in the store so freshness does matter it is best to buy the cheese by the block and shred it yourself since i have been doing that all my recipes that call for cheese have come out perfectly i got this tip from paula dean it was a question she answered from her cooking magazine i hope this helped you
5,great hubby cant eat white potatoes so i substituted sweet potato cubes really good with the ham a keeper recipe
5,appears some are using inexpensive cheese no such thing use the real thing no problems the bacon is good but unnecessary as the ham has the wonderful smoky flavor i used olive oil in place of bacon drippings very good chowder and complete meal in a bowl
5,very yummy recipe i did need to add more liquid cup chicken broth and almost cups milk i also added the cheese after thickening the sauce and before adding the potatoes it worked really well and was nice and smooth
5,too bad there are only stars i made this for my son and i on monday we each ate two bowls and he took the rest home i made it again wednesday for another family and didnt get back home before my cellphone was ringing with their praises i did take some hints from other reviewers by using precooked bacon and some bacon grease saved in my fridge i had frozen some homemade chicken stock which i always save when i am making enchiladas or casseroles with cooked chicken and milk in place of water and bouillon and as i only had cups cheddar when i made it the first time i added a cup of colbyjack i had on hand it was so good i decided to use the same combo again the first time i used a whole drained can of niblets and the second time a heaping cup of frozen corn thawed both worked great i did finely chop a rib of celery to saute with the onion and carrot both times i am delighted to have a new soup recipe that is so good i cant wait to make it again
5,this recipe makes the easiest and thickest chowder i could ever have hoped for i will make this again and again i eliminated the bacon and ham used a little olive oil instead and it was awesome chopping the veggies fine in a food processor helped too thanks for sharing this versatile recipe
5,this is a wonderful recipe our family always enjoys it and i make it for company as well it always gets good reviews
5,very good as is i have used chicken broth instead of bouillon you can add in any little dabs of leftover veggies to use them up and it is still good
5,been making this chowder for yearsit is the best
5,i make this a few times a year and love it i usually omit the corn and instead of bouillon i always use cups of milk and cups of chicken broth so delicious
5,this recipe is fabulous as written but still not simple enough for my teenagers to prepare without complaints when it is their turn to cook we usually use three cans of cubed potatoes and skip the fresh ones we usually use matchstick carrots so we dont have to chop if we use bacon we use real bacon pieces such as hormel like you can find in the salad section of the store we usually saute the carrot and onion in olive oil since i dont have bacon grease to use because i use canned potatoes i only heat it through before i add the ham and cheese the whole family loves this recipe and it is not unusual to make a double recipe so that we can enjoy it as leftovers
5,this is fabulous i used skim milk and otherwise made as directed
5,adding this to our list of favourite family meals i made the chowder ahead of dinner time and wasnt able to hold off eating it sooooo unbelievably tasty thanks for the share
5,i absolutely love this recipe it wasnt too timedemanding and well worth the effort i honestly cant wait to make it again
5,great tasting followed directions exactly and will definitely be making again
5,my children loved this recipe
5,love love love this recipe it is just so warm and comforting everyone loves it
5,great recipe didnt change a thing recipe claims it serves but my family of made the whole thing disappear will make again
5,my husband love it
5,ive made this soup many times since it was first published and everybody loves it i usually use precooked bacon i find there is enough grease left to saute the onions and carrots in
5,sooo good love it i added less cheese because it was already reach i used velveeta cheese to get this thickness and flavor before now i know what i can use instead of velveeta
5,the recipe is awesome i cut it in half and used fresh corn on the cob that i had cut off rather than the can corn i also added white pepper which goes well with soup and potato recipes this is a recipe that ill share with a lot of people
5,this was so easy to make and everyone in my family loved it this casserold will be a mainstay in my family for many years
5,made this for company breakfast and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe making it today again so easy and i think i cut back slightly on fat and it was still good a definite keeper
5,excellent always goes fast
5,easy and delicious
5,my family loved it
5,this is my go to recipe when i am having overnight guests love it
5,made recipe as is but used more eggs for pot luck made it healthier for myself using shreddred summer squash in place of potatoes and was excellent amp none knew the difference
5,everybody loved it on a rv trip so much that i wouldnt count on serving more like
5,my favorite breakfast casserole by far i usually make it with lb of bob evans sausage instead of the bacon because i keep it frozen one of our favorites
5,quick yummy and my kids even ate it
5,i made this for easter assembled everything saturday night and left it in the fridge and threw it in the oven for mins on sunday morning so good i used a pound of lunch meat ham instead of bacon and added chopped mushrooms as well very good
5,very tasty would definitely make again and again and again
5,was excellent wouldnt change a thing
5,this was a quick and delicious dessert my family loved it we have a lot of guests in the fall and im adding this dessert to my menu to serve
5,perfect apple crisp this recipe is easy to make and it turns out amazing every time great fall dessert and even better served with vanilla ice cream
5,to reduce our sugar intake i reduced both sugars by and it turned out fantastic i will definitely be making this again
5,i cut back a bit on both sugars as other reviewers suggested i added chopped pecans and cinnamon to the crumb topping and it was delicious next time ill add additional apples too
5,my husbands favorite dessert make this at least once every year so easy to make sometimes will skip the ice cream and drizzle caramel sauce on top this will make it extra sweet its a keeper
5,i make a version of this with cup each raisins and chopped walnuts found that it works best with juicy apples otherwise too dry i think i used red delicious apples last time oh and tsp of cinnamon helps to cut back on the sweetness it is a rich dessert but yummy
5,pi baked it for the first time it is very easy and delicious made few changes substitute brown sugar with jaggery could not get oats so substituted with crushed oats cookies instead of water and sugar used canned apple juice the recipe came out perfect so easy and so delicious p
5,this was delicious really liked the crust on the bottom it was a little sweet so definitely needed the ice cream i will definitely make again
5,this was really good i chopped the carrots onions and ham ahead of time in the day so at dinner time i just had to throw it all together i used frozen corn and thawed it first
5,i tried this recipe with vegan butter to see if it would work as a dessert option for a vegan relative at thanksgiving and it came out beautifully you couldnt tell it wasnt regular butter will also try this with pears and peaches
5,this is definitely the best apple crisp ive ever had i have been making this recipe since
5,i really dont like any apple desserts after trying a friends apple crisp i thought id try to make my own im so glad i found this recipe yes its sweet it is dessert after all a little bit is just enough perfect for gatherings thank you
5,wow this is wonderful family all loved it i cut sugar by added an extra cup of apples and sprinkled cinnamon on top before baking i baked it as the recipe said for minutes and it was perfect thank you
5,only thing i done different was put the sliced apples in a bowl sprinkled with cinnamon and mixed it up good before placing the apples in the baking dish and i also used pure almond flavoring in place of the vanilla while still warm top with scoop of ice cream and drizzle caramel topping over the top delicious
5,this is the best apple recipe ever theres no need to make an apple pie with crust after making this gem it is extremely simple and the taste is phenomenal if you love apple pie a la mode this is the recipe for you i get requests for it over and over again the only change i make is adding an extra apple or so until the apples are piled high in the pan i also split the apple varieties and use honeycrisp and granny smith i use a little more granny smith than honeycrisp usually about honey crisps to granny smiths dependent on apple size
5,its a good easy to make recipe based on other reviews i only used a third of the white sugar and of the brown sugar came out great the right amount of sweetness ill make it again
5,it turned out great but i did cut the sugar in half for both the filling and crumble part i also put in a little salt
5,this crisp is very good like others i used half of the sugars and it was still very good
5,the recipe was good and i loved it
5,very yummy and easy to make will definitely make again
5,i made this for a mothers day breakfast for my family instead of bacon i used a hamsteak it was very good
5,awesome
5,this recipe is so easy amp delicious and the left overs were just as tasty reheated this recipe is awesome as is but next time i make this i want to try fresh mushrooms amp maybe some green pepper
5,although this is a great recipe on its own ive sauteed bell peppers wthe onions and added green chilis just gives it a little extra kick i rate the original recipe very highly everyone loves it
5,my family loves this weve even had it for dinner
5,i made this recipe for a brunch held after my th high school reunion for our committee i made and their was not a crumb left plus several classmates requested the recipe
5,this was awesome we dont really like swiss cheese so i substituted mozzarella though
5,this was awesome only substituted mozzarella for the swiss because we dont really like swiss
5,had a small group and halved the recipe and it was still so yummy i used cubed hashbrowns because thats what i had on hand had to cook it for the last mins to get it to finish great dish for groups big and small
5,excellent the entire family loved it
5,this is an amazing amp easytomake casserolei always prepare it on christmas eve and throw it in the oven christmas morning
5,i first made this for guests they loved it and wanted the recipe we like it as well and have made it again its a great company breakfast casserole
5,i made this over the holiday and guests really liked it i thought it was too rich with all the bacon and cheese next time id probably half the bacon and increase the amount of hash browns in the recipe i also used cottage cheese
5,our family really enjoys this breakfast dish it is so much better than those that are based on bread and you dont have to wait with it in the fridge overnight i used pork sausage instead of bacon but like both
5,i agree too much sugar the second time i made it i used cup of both sugars i will use cup the next time i make it delicious hot with vanilla ice cream
5,just made this today it is excellent i followed recipe as is and next time i will cut both the brown sugar and white in half it is sweet as apple crisp is but it wouldnt hurt cutting back a bit taste just like from a restaurant
5,my husband is not a big dessert person things he will only eat chocolate cake and apple pie so i made this and a asked him to please just try this he did he loved it and took a big bowl of it he said i can make this now in place of his apple pie
5,i tried this using less sugar and more apples different than any recipe ive used in the pastturned out fabulous this is the only way i will ever make it from now on im sure other types of fruit would be good also thanks so much s here
5,delicious i used granny smith apples and doubled the recipe made for group of and everyone loved it put topping in bottom as suggested did not countmeasure apples just kept piling them up till they filled my pyrex dish x and put remainder of topping as best i could on top before pouring liquid over put pan or foil under dish since it will probably bubble over in oven served with vanilla ice cream but excellent without
5,easy to make and family loved it delish
5,delicious i sprinkled extra cinnamon and sugar over the apples before adding the crumb topping
5,absolutely delicous it was a hit with everyone i made it as the the recipe stated and it was great we liked the chewy crispy topping but would have liked more of it i will double that part when i make it again
5,made it as written and used granny smith apples just the right amount of topping and a good amount of apple filling will make it again
5,i make this every fallwith honeycrisp applesamazing
5,i made this with some apples a friend gave me and it did not disappoint it had lots of cinnamon flavor and crumbly crust which are my favorite parts the extra liquid you prepare to add to the apples did make it a little on the sweet side but i loved the addition of vanilla
5,i would recommend cooking it an additional minutes i really liked my apples soft like apple pie and the topping more caramelized it was fantastic
5,everyone enjoyed this apple crisp i diced the apple smaller then normal going to add peaches next time
5,even though i gave this recipe stars i think there is way too much sweetness with cups of sugars fantastic recipe and this is definitely a keeper i will just decrease the amount of both white and brown sugar the next time
5,this was an awesome apple crisp followed suggestions and cut both sugars in half loved the bottom crust
5,i thought it was amazing and will definitely make it again i cut the whole recipe in half because i made it for just two people i will probably cut back on some of the sugar also
5,love this its my goto apple crisp recipe i do also cut down on the sugars and go heavy on the apples and it is delicious love the way the crusttopping gets a little chewycrispy sometimes i double the recipe in a x for company
5,this is one of the best apple crisp recipes i have tried i did cut back the sugars by half and will cut back more next time i make it as i still found it sweet i did add some nutmeg and will add more cinnamon next time
5,i really loved this recipe we acquired some apples from my sons tree which we believe to be a golden delicious therefore i did cut the sugar for the filling back to cup and used tbsp apple cider vinegar in the cup of water to tang it up of course i had to eat my first serving before it had cooled completely with melting vanilla ice cream on top so delish and i know it will be even better tomorrow after the flavors blend together i will make it with granny smith apples and try apple cider instead of water next time and i believe itll be perfect for my familys taste thanks so much for sharing gertrude
5,i have to say i was a little concerned because of all the flour and corn starch but it was absolutely delicious
5,definitely a winning recipe at my house this is the best apple crisp ive ever eaten
5,easy and delicious i used honey crisp apples and will try other apples next time there will definitely be a next timeexcellent in my book
5,this is a delicious crisp recipe albeit rather sweet for our taste the first time i made it i followed the recipe as directed i now make it with half the sugar i do squeeze fresh lemon over the apples to balance the acidity and sweetness next time i plan on trying apple cider in place of the water and further cutting the sugar to c for even more apple flavor my husband craves this apple crisp as soon as the cooler fall weather arrives
5,this was the best bfast casserole we have had very good i added pepper and also some hot sauce to it awesome d
5,this is the best breakfast casserole ive ever made or eaten i take it to our monthly birthday parties at work and get lots of raves and asking for the recipe i use sausage and add more eggs than what it calls for
5,this is a wonderful breakfast casserole i make this up in several small pans and then send one to our daughter in college she loves it even rewarmed
5,yummy and easy it was the perfect size to feed a large group this will be served at our home
5,really yummy especially with breakfast sausage i was worried there wouldnt be enough flavor but there totally was i sprinkled pepper in it and used mozzarella instead of swiss cheese just because im not the biggest fan of swiss cheese this would also be a really easy recipe to halve
5,i make this every easter and every bit of it goes so good i prep it the night before and toss it in a pan on easter morning couldnt be easier i use sausage sometimes to switch it up

5,can you use regular italian sausage in this recipe if so would i cook it first and then put in slow cooker

5,my savannah georgia bred husband says it is the best he has ever had thats a winning vote in my book
5,this is so easy and so very good i questioned whether jambalaya made in the crock pot could have the flavor i so enjoy but i am now a believer i will be making this again i used imitation crab in place of the scrimp
5,i absolutely love this recipe i didnt like the overpowering smoked sausage flavor the first time i made this personal preference so i eliminated the smoked sausage altogether the second time i made it and it still turned out incredible
5,excellent we love the flavor and its easy to make ill make this often
5,this was a very easy jambalaya to make it had just the right amount of spice for me very hearty and filling
5,this recipe takes a lot of prep time but after you throw it in the crock pot its all worth it the seasonings are just right and it makes a large amount i ended up freezing half great for watching football
5,since miss cindi is from texas i did not expect a louisiana let alone a new orleans style jambalaya i found this forgotten texas jambalaya to be very flavorful and it certainly wont be forgotten in our homei cut this recipe in half since there are only two of us i used only ¼ tsp each of the hot pepper sauce and cayenne pepper to suit our personal tastes and i found andouille sausage at our local supermarket served it on a bed of jasmine long grain rice my daughter suggested adding tsp of file powder the next time i make this thank you miss cindi
5,this recipe is wonderful my husband said its the best crockpot recipe of any kind that ive ever made i made it exactly like the recipe saidexcept i was out of parsley flakes i dont know how much of a difference it wouldve have made because it was absolutely delicious

5,authentic jambalaya or not it is fantastic i had a pound of shrimp and just threw it all in thats what my family kept picking out
5,oh my god we loved this recipe i omitted the hot sauce and used chili powder instead of cayenne and it was good used a whole pound of shrimp also the aroma is phenomenal will make again
5,my family loves this i cant use shell fish because of allergies but i just add more sausage we lived near cajun country and although this is not what they would call authentic it sure is good be sure to use quality andouille sausage it makes a big difference we all love hot spicy food so after the first time i added tony chacheres as well as all the spices indicated this is on my rotation of regulars thanks cindi

5,i loved this recipe i substitued sage sausage for the bacon and it was a big hit i think it could pass as a side dish for any meal
5,i made this recipe for a church event and it was gone in minutes there was another breakfast casserole dish next to it and mine was gone way before the other i used browned breakfast sausage and eggs i didnt have swiss cheese so i didnt use it and truth be told we didnt miss it i think the extra cheese would have made it too rich and greasy i baked for hour minutes in my oven likely due to the extra eggs the addition of cottage cheese was an unexpected surprise but i didnt even notice it was there if anything it added moisture to the dish so that it would not be too dry this is a great glutenfree recipe to breakfast casseroles that use bread i also prepped this dish in a pan and let it sit overnight before baking in the morning next time i might add a small can of green chiles to the mix this will be my goto recipe for breakfast casserole
5,i just have a question about this recipe it looks really yummy has anyone made this exactly how the recipe says the night before baking and if so did it turn out good
5,this is the best breakfast casserole i have ever made i cut into pieces and freeze thaw in refrigerator the number of squares you want overnight heat in microwave and you have a quick week day breakfast great served with grits and toast

5,super easy and quick i added some nuts everyone loved them
5,wow these are the easiest most delicious muffins ive ever made i did bananas instead of and added a dash of pink himalayan salt as a final step use a handheld mixer to make things easier
5,delicious muffins this is one of the easiest banana muffin recipes ive ever tried and it was the one with the best results ive made my fair share of banana muffins over the years and i think this recipe made the best muffins yet i kept the recipe completely as written but i did add about a half cup of chopped walnuts to the batter i love that it called for vegetable oil instead of crisco made it even faster to complete the recipe i would definitely recommend this recipe
5,yum super easy and tasty i added cinnamon which wad am excellent choice i do not own stand mixer but i enjoy the tiny chunks of banana very good with a honey butter spread
5,this was a huge hit at my office just as the previous reviewer said in the recipe i usually make it has use a slightly different ratio of flour and sugar c flour and sugar so its the same volume of dry ingredients but the first time i made this recipe i followed it as written i thought it would be too sweet with double sugar im used to tasting and three sweet ripe bananas but it wasnt too sweet at all in fact the person in my office who usually is most concerned with sugar content raved about these and with good reason too because they are delicious if you want to reduce the sugar by up to half the called for amount they are still yummy but just remember to compensate by adding flour equal to the reduction in sugar personally im fine with c sugar the only variations i use are to sprinkle the top of each muffin with about th tsp of raw unwashed sugar before baking because the big crystals bake a nice caramelized sugar crunch to the muffin tops i also preheat the oven degrees higher than baking temp then when i put the muffins in drop the temp to the correct temp i found these indeed take the full min or so even with the high preheat temp supposedly the high preheat temp makes them crown higher without over baking them as a side note parchment paper cupcake liners work the best if you have them thanks for reading my long review again killer recipe ive made it several times now with great results each time thank you so much for a great addition to my muffin rotation
5,these are simple to make and tasty for a treat or quick breakfast what i like most about this recipe is how easy it is to jazz up i add chopped walnuts or chocolate chips to it sometimes a dash of almond extract instead of vanilla this is my goto recipe to use up ripened bananas its quick and my family scarfs them down in no time
5,this recipe is a keeper i printed it off to add to my recipe collection my bananas were very large so i used i added about to cup of mini chocolate chips i also topped some with raw sugar and the rest i sprinkled on large sugar crystals that i use to top cookies i liked the crunch that the sugar gave to the muffins muffins do take the full baking time and then i baked a couple of minutes more i got muffins from the recipe
5,this is my favorite banana muffin recipe because i dont have to deal with shortening or butter i do add about t of cinnamon to the dry ingredients and accidentally added a second egg the muffins were super moist i only needed about minutes of baking and they were pretty dark on the outside still looked good but not that golden color that could just mean my oven isnt accurate entirely possible
5,these are by far the best banana muffins i added about a cup of cinnamon applesauce amp they came out extremely moist i filled the muffin tins over half full amp it made muffins even after days in the fridge they are still moist as ever very easy amp definitely a hit with the family this is my new go to recipe for ripe bananas enjoy

5,best ever my go to muffin recipe especially when i have extra bananas around i have made this times there are so many ways to tweak this and the result is always perfect i always decrease the oil to cup then add a heaping tablespoon of either vanilla yogurt sour cream or applesauce to compensate i also always decrease the sugar by a few tablespoons and you would never know sometimes i add some shredded zucchini by decreasing an equal amount of banana my moms favorite way to enjoy these was warmed in the microwave with a dab of butter they are also good with chocolate chips mixed in or by adding a streusel topping
5,very good
5,this is now my goto banana muffin recipe i sometimes add c of blueberries or c diced strawberries i always add about c chopped walnuts or pecans i make instead of muffins because of the additions and i found the original recipe to be just too much for only muffins everybody loves these muffins yeeeaaa
5,these were so easy to make i added chocolate chips to mine i have started subbing in applesauce for the oil and you cant even tell

5,dont let the word basic confuse you these are the best banana muffins ive ever made i get compliments and requests for the recipe frequently they are delicious
5,great recipe i made as directed for the first batch amp then changed it up for the second in the second batch i substituted canned apple amp raspberry pie fruitsame quantity as banana for the banana amp it worked just as perfectly

5,delicious light and moist muffins this is my familys new favorite muffin recipe and my yr old helped with every step we made a double batch and used equal amounts mashed ripe plums skins removed and bananas plus added a bit of ground ginger and cinnamon best muffins weve ever made
5,thanks so much for a delicious banana muffin that even i could make
5,ive made these muffins at least a dozen times easy tasty and my family loves them great way to use those last few overripe bananas
5,this breakfast casserole was delicious i cooked it in the cast iron skillet i cooked the bacon in then served it with sliced avocado and tomatoes
5,i thought the mixture looked dry for an egg casserole so i added cup of milk dont do it i had to bake it longer because of the extra moisture follow the directions it tasted excellent
5,i have two breakfast casseroles that i traditionally make and this one is hands down the favorite based on the good reviews i used my sunday school class as guinea pigs and made this recipe because it is enough to feed a group there was not one bite left and many request for the recipe i did put together the casserole the day before and took it out the next morning to bake i needed about minutes more baking time minutes total also based on some of the other reviewers suggestions i added a small can of diced green chiles which added perfect flavor overall this dish is a winner
5,a definite keeper ive made this for gatherings of both family and friends this recipe is hit and i make it just as the recipe identifies guests always ask for the recipe
5,i used to make this several years ago we really enjoyed it
5,my mom has made this for years and is the go to recipe when all of the family is over for breakfast excellent
5,very delicious i cut the recipie in half and used an x baking dish i assembled it the night before and popped it in the oven this morning
5,this is one of our favorite recipes we like it with hamgood way to use leftovers im going to do what one other reviewer did and try ricotta cheese this time since i have some i need to use thanks for recipe
5,the whole family loves this when ive brought this dish for potluck gatherings literally everyone asks for the recipe
5,recently made this one it was very good will definitely make again
5,i like recipes where i have all the ingredients so tasty and easy to fix and a family that finds eggs a problem enjoyed every bite of this and when were having this again next saturday when we will have guest thanks for this breakfast reciperosemary
5,i made this and it was a huge hit substituted sausage for bacon since i didnt have bacon added chopped up red pepper instead of onions as well served with homemade biscuits and fruit will make again
5,i made this for saturday dinner and my son and i like it i substituted sausage for bacon the next time i think i might add green pepper definitely a keeper
5,served this for guests and everyone enjoyed it i used hot turkey sausage instead of bacon and monterey jack cheese instead of swiss i seasoned the eggs and threw in some red bell pepper because i had it on hand i made it the day before and did not thaw the hash browns per another reviewers suggestion worked great next time ill add some diced green chiles or hot peppers to spice it up a bit more really good
5,well based on some of the reviews yes i made some changes bc of the changes i was able to make two lasagnas and i used the no boil lasagna winwini added a ricotta mix to make this dish like a lasagna to my ricotta i like to add chili powder egg garlic powder salt fresh cilantro and black pepper i think the chili powder help to bring out the flavor to the whole dish bc it is a creamy dishi did add fresh chopped garlic when i cooked the green onions but i also added and cooked diced white onion tooi doubled the creamy mix bc i used the no boil lasagna noodles and i felt the ratio of the seafood shrimp cut into pieces if using large shrimp lb scallops lb and claw crab meat lb would have needed the extra saucei did not expect to make but i did one dish had noodle layers and my other dish just had noodle layersi did noodle ricotta mozzarella and parmesean cheese layer followed by seafood sauce then repeat the layers be sure to reserve just a cup of sauce without the seafood for the top last layer of the lasagna i did top that with mozzarella too i didnt reserve sauce for my nd dish top noodle so it was covered with the seafood i didnt want it to burn so that one had extra mozzarella cheese on ityes this is a heart attack waiting to happen but if you are going for it then go for it i wouldnt make this everyday maybe special occasions everyone loved it i made it for a potluck it is a little time consuming but oh so good the other dish i gave pieces away i only wanted pieces bc i am health conscious but no doubt with my changes it was goodi dont measure but i used this recipe as a guideline
5,made this twice absolutely delicious made it today for my sisters birthday shes never had it cant wait for her to taste it
5,fabulous i added mozzarella cheese on top and within layers also some ricotta cheese in the middle
5,i added lobster meat as well the fam loved it
5,this is absolutely the best lasagna i have ever made or eaten made by the recipe and the only change was the addition of some lobster and used real crab instead of imitation only down side is the cost of good seafood for the preparation maybe well splurge again for christmas
5,this is a wonderful recipe to use i modified it but adding some adobo recaito and sazon when preparing the onions and seafood if youve never tried adding spanish seasonings to recipes give it a whirl they give any recipe a new spin on taste
5,ive made this recipe many times in fact its my husbands requested birthday meal every year i make it just as recipe states because i believe if you adjust things you should rate a different recipe the only ratings of this recipe should be before adjusting star perfect every time
5,a family favorite
5,this is the besta real family favorite if you love seafood and pasta youll love this
5,time consuming to make slightly expensive to afford but oooh sooo good every time i make this i have to double the recipe can be frozen and baked later does not seem to effect the taste or texture i love that it is from scratch to who ever come up with this recipe well done
5,my family thought this was the best dish ever there were no leftovers and i think if id doubled it they would have still eaten all of it
5,delicious my sauce was a little bit runny after it baked ill be sure to thicken it a bit more next time but this recipe is definitely a keeper
5,this is the bomb when i take it out to potluck it is the first dish emptied everyone asks for the recipe
5,i have to join the other star raters with this one its very rich and wonderful impressive and very satisfying i did use a few suggestions i feel that this recipe will do just fine with just seafood choices if crab is one of them use fresh next time i will just use shrimp amp crab i also reduced the clam juice and used a dry sherrythis recipe will serve quite a few so i downsized it to just i also feel that this would be perfect for stuffing pasta shells next time for surejanietaste of home volunteer food editor
5,if you love seafood this is a real hit i made it for the first time last night and shared with friends everyone loved it i did use real crab meat ill be sure to drain the pot with seafood better next time as the sauce was just a bit runny but it was still delicious i also used whole wheat lasagna
5,i made this for christmas dinner it was a huge hit and my daughter requested it for her birthday dinner i used canned crabmeat instead of the imitation stuff even though it was finely shredded it worked extremely well and actually gave some body to the sauce i also used just a little extra shrimp scallops and crabmeat it was fantastic and will be a goto for special dinners
5,oh my goodness this dish is absolutely fantabulous i used pounds of shrimp ounces pound ounce of real jumbo lump crab meat and pounds of bay scallops ounces i doubled everything else i also added fresh garlic to my green onion mixture and i added the garlic just before i added the broth and juices i used costcos fresh aged parmigiano reggiano cheese my sauce was not bland at all it was thick rich and decadent also in the doubling process i used an ounce bottle of clam juice and an ounce bottle of lobster juice be sure to drain the seafood stock from the meat to ensure your source isnt runny additionally because mine did not brown after minutes of baking i put it under the broiler for about minutes it was perfect while the seafood makes the dish costly it was well worth it i will certainly be making it again
5,fantastic i expected this dish to be delicious based on the standing star rating but it was even better than i expected could hold its own against any seafood lasagna ive eaten at restaurants agree with other comments great for christmas or special occasion meals as it is really rich and can be pricy my recipe adaptations based on seafood avail in ks lbs king crab legs not alaskan lbs sea scallops since they were almost half as expensive as bay and are more tender cut into smaller pieces lbs frozen wild salad shrimp costco using the fresh crab was well worth it once i was done cracking it all the flavor was amazing i added roasted garlic cloves to the sauce as well my entire family loved this lasagna including kids and some pickier people i will absolutely make this again actually less expensive per lb than canned crab i also doubled the recipe as others and so glad i did i also used delallo organic italian whole wheat lasagna no boil noodles which are my go to for lasagna
5,very very good definitely making this again
5,an excellent recipe i used a bit more shrimp as my family is not fond of scallops fish cubes for stock is a good subsitution for both the chicken stock and clam juice if you do that cut back on the salt this is a rich and satisfying meal it looks and tastes sophisticated freezes well too
5,the family loved this of course with everything you put your own spin on it according to your household pallet i only added and didnt remove anything the recipe called for i doubled the recipe large house of i added onion old bay seasoning red pepper flakes frozen and squeeze drained spinach also topped it with cheddar cheese it was absolutely amazing only downfall it was pretty pricey but worth it
5,a great lasagna recipe i like to add thinlysliced mushrooms as the crab scallop shrimp and cream sauce mixture can become a little rich without the mushrooms to balance it out i also believe in splurging a little more on real lump crab meat as opposed to imitation crab meat as this dish is one that deserves the best
5,absolutely delicious i made it instead of my usual recipe and it was awesome would make a great soup also best online recipe i have ever made
5,this was sooo good i made it using frozen shrimp and scallops both defrosted wonderful taste rich and creamy will definitely make it again
5,i made this for fathers day it was delicious it had the perfect combination of seafood i used real crab meat
5,dont try this on kids activity night this dish is timeconsuming but ohso worth it imitation crabmeat i dont think so i use oz cans lump crabmeat i also use half amp half instead of whipping cream which is what i do for all recipes calling for whipping cream other than those changes minor the recipe is excellent as written
5,this is a truly delicious lasagna the leftovers taste amazing too i will definitely make this again next time i wont precook the seafood the shrimps were slightly overcooked in mine still i cant complain this recipe is a keeper
5,very good recipe i had made it on christmas day used real crab meat it is one of those special occasion recipes
5,delicious with lobster meat instead of crab
5,love this lasagna
5,a truly amazing rich lasagna mmmmm good
5,de licious made for christmas used real crab meat very very good
5,wow just wow a sinfully rich and creamy big occasion lasagna for sure i made no changes except to omit green onions use my own favoured combo of seafood shrimp squid and snapper fish and to make extra of the white sauce as advised by a lot of reviewers served this at a late night christmas eve gathering and the whole thing was polished off in minutes and everyone raved about how good it was i am especially pleased at how flavourful the white sauce was and the seafood wasnt overcooked at all because of the double cooking process seafood is boiled then baked yummm
5,i am preparing this to night for the super bowl patriots fan serving this tomorrow with chili home made sausage onions and peppers and your delicious seafood lasagna will keep you posted go patriots
5,jadore la vie damour a very sensual lasagna for a valentines evening
5,best seafood lasagna ive made to date in all categories taste texture and presentation relatively easy felt good going together i substituted lb of fresh crabmeat for the imitation crab my foodie dinner guests thought it was one of the best they have ever tasted note that it is very rich and easily serves when making for just ourselves i think ill cut this into pieces
5,made this on a beach trip used potatoes obrien and added mushrooms used shredded bacon cheddar cheese and sharp cheddar this was fantastic so many different things you could add loved it
5,family enjoyed it
5,very good will make again for sure
5,used sausage instead of bacon added cup milk minced garlic cloves and tsp black pepper very good
5,i make this several times a year i bring it to staff breakfasts at my school as well always a hit
5,fantastic i use this for holiday breakfast time when family comes over i make it up the night before and its so easy for morning i add some additional ingredients like mushrooms and green peppers everyone enjoys
5,made this for a church pot luck and brought home an empty dish i did use hot sausage instead of bacon and liked the flavor it added
5,we made this for our guests on christmas morning a huge hit even for the picky eaters we also crave it for lunch and dinner now
5,ive made this several times and its always a hiti use bulk sausage in place of the bacon just my preferencedefinitely one of my favorite go to recipes for an easy and tasty breakfast or brunch dish
5,not many recipes have reviews i made this for supper for my adult son and i the other night i had read a lot of the reviews and also checked out other recipe sites online for the same recipe title i used a dozen eggs and roughly chopped half a container of fresh sliced mushrooms from costco which i fried with the onions in the same pan as i had fried the bacon i used low sodium separately i added a generous amount of freshly ground pepper my son loves it but didnt add salt as i felt the bacon and the cheese would provide enough seeing as i hadnt made this before i didnt make any other changes unusual for me it was a wholesome meal i accompanied it with a dish of stewed herb and spice whole tomatoes but will use vine ripened local ones when they are available i might even fry fresh tomato halves in the leftover bacon drippings i will also serve it with a variety of relish and chutney recipes i make another reviewers comment about using salsa is an option before warming the leftovers my son asked me to ramp up the flavour so i sprinkled some cayenne and garlic powder on the top and then added a layer of shredded cheddar cheese i was pleased with the result i dont like food as hotspicy as my son and my son thought it was an improvement he wants me to make another one next week mixing the cayenne and garlic into the mixture before putting it in the casserole dish adding a bit more of both than id put on the one i reheated obviously a personal preference he also wants me to substitute half the hash browns for thawed mixed veggies ill also add the whole g container of cottage cheese thats cup more than in this recipe as we both love cheese really pleased to find this recipe thanks beth notaro for sharing it reminds me of an old order mennonite friend i had who died too early a few years ago with cancer im sure that association added to my enjoyment of this casserole im sure ill be making this countless times with numerous variations as well as ones close to the original i like the idea that its bread and gluten free as i have friends who are conscious of needing to avoid gluten
5,very easy quick and tasty i used sausage instead of bacon a real family hit
5,i save bacon grease so instead of using a pound of bacon i saute the onions in approximately tbs of bacon grease and add a pack of the store bought diced ham i follow the rest of the directions the ba on grease gives it a little bacon taste and the ham makes it seem meatier
5,easy to prepare and really enjoyed the taste and texture i added ham cubes and parsle instead of bacon the hash brown werent totally thawed so i needed to bake it an additional minutes next time i want to add asparagus or spinach for added flavor and nutritional value will be part of my family recipe cookbook
5,this is the bestme and my daughter made it for a girls night and it was a big hit all my friends enjoyed one even asked for the recipe there was no leftovers i did make one alteration like a few others i doubled the chicken broth and only used half the clam juice the wine recomendation helped also
5,i make this every christmas everyone loves it i find that i use much less of the sauce because it comes out thicker and less soupy i all so use big scallops big shrimp and real crabmeat it truly is a special meal
5,the only change i made was to use real crabmeatperfect
5,this was delicious i substituted gluten free lasagna noodles and an almond based flour and used real crabmeat fantastic it was a huge hit at my dinner party and our gluten intolerant friend appreciated it
5,ive made this a number of times l cut the shrimp up to the size of the scallops i do it in pyrex so it can go out right in the dish everyone loves it nice salad white wine and crusty bread great janet
5,amend the recipe to include real crabmeat and then add another star to the rating system and we have a winner with my family a little pricey because i have to double my recipe for my family but worth every penny and is still less than the seafood dinners and more portions and better quality than dining out
5,one of my alltime favorites i use sea scallops large shrimp and real crab meat double the sauce to accompany the larger quantities of seafood used i also add a good shake of white wine while making the sauce learned that one from gourmet magazine many years ago it is a holidayspecial occasion recipe for my company always a stellar hit
5,i made this for christmas everyone loved it next time i will double the sauce
5,made this for my husband for our anniversary it was absolutely delicious definitely will make again
5,wonderful
5,i served this recipe with a few changes lobster instead of crab added mushrooms tried to keep down the calories by using milk instead of the whipping cream amp all chicken broth instead of clam juice to a discerning group of ladies with compliments all around the table i plan to make this sauce amp serve it over pasta or rice next time the rice should nicely sop it up
5,i also did some minor changes as i did not have the scallops on hand i used twice the imitation crab used cans of crab meat drained and medium sized tail on shrimp it was work intensive but it turned out amazing i will make this again and again
5,yum added a tablespoon of brandy to the white sauce and it really brought out the flavor and creaminess ive also made this where i mixed the white sauce and seafood mix and then poured it into a x over cheese ravioli cooked at until bubbly one of my familys favorites
5,i have made this many times and had rave reviews have even baked ahead and froze still was excellent if you dont want to spend the money for scallops you can use more shrimpimitationcrab
5,very tasty
5,i made for dinner last night amazing and simple to make
5,i cut this recipe in half mostly to fit in an x square pyrex pan used a oz bag of frozen shrimp half a pound of bay scallops and oz of lobster delights some sort of surimi flavored the cream sauce with a couple tablespoons of dry white wine served with garlic bread and a green salad with raspberry vinaigrette quite excellent
5,i made this last night and my guests couldnt get enough of it and asked for the recipe six of us ate the whole plan i served it with a salad and herbed bread i followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect the sauce was creamy and smooth i found out that bay scallops the small ones are sweeter than the big scallops which tend to be tasteless i made it in the morning and cooked it at night next time ill try making it the night before just because i like to do as much as possible beforehand it was easy to make my husband cant wait for me to make it again
5,this was very yummy the only change made to the recipe was cup of chicken broth amp cup of clam juice because other commented about the fishy taste also more seasoning to taste that noted
5,this was phenomenal i would certainly make this again i followed the recipe and had nothing but compliments
5,i was looking for a quick and tasty recipe for our housewarming dinner adults kids can i just say that this recipe was amazing not a labour of love like other lasagna recipes there was plenty for everyone including left overs i will definitely make this againi use another reviewers suggestion double the chicken broth and half the clam juice and spring onions and black pepper instead of white didnt have any i also added a tablespoon of lemon juice to the seafood very nice recipe

5,i have made this so many times that i could do it blindfolded this is the best lasagna ive ever had my grandson will call me and ask me to make it for him everytime he comes to visit i even have a cousin who offers to pay me to make it lol this is truly the best thank you so much for sharing this
5,i have been making this for years i freeze milky ways and chop in food processor for add in this is my granddaughters most requested recipe from her nans kitchen
5,delicious easy to prepare great to take to potlucks
5,this salad is great the only problem is it makes a huge batch
5,everyone loved it even the kids i did cut the sugar to c because my grapes were pretty sweet
5,ive made this many times and even people who are not especially fond of grapes love it its always a hit i do however toast the pecans i never liked having to heat up the oven to toast a few nuts and always found the fry pan gave me unreliable results so now i do it in the microwave by melting a generous teaspoon of butter on a microwave safe dish and spreading cup of chopped nuts on it microwave for a minute and stir microwave one more minute and stir in my microwave thats all the time i need let cool so easy
5,very good i had no pecans on hand and used sliced almonds
5,i grew up in jenison hi marge it really is a potluck sort of town this recipe was fantastic since i was making it for my family i halved the recipe the toasted pecans and brown sugar on top were the perfect foil for the tart grapes and cream cheese wow
5,this is the best keeps longer than saads made with cool whip does not get watery couldnt stop eating it
5,this grape salad is delicious i used green and red grapes in this recipe plus it added some nice color to it this can also be made as a low fat recipe i used fat free sour cream amp cream cheese amp used splenda for sugar cup equals point for weight watchers
5,i love this salad and have made it for summer bbqs for years i prefer to mix the cream cheese sugar vanilla and sour cream and then let it set in the fridge over night take it out a little before my family leaves then add the grapes to the mixture and add toppings it seems to just give everything a chance to mesh together ive never had a complaint not sure what they used to make it taste like mayo but it sounds like a user error rather then a recipe fail to me
5,i have been making this for years and everyone loves it my recipe calls for tablespoons of brown sugar and to put half in the dressing and the rest sprinkled with the nuts the biggest thing is to dry the grapes after washing them if they are wet the dressing slides off i live close by marge also this recipe must have been shared at all of the west michigan gatherings
5,i made this recipe after having it at work one day and this was better than what i had its very creamy and i didnt change anything just added more brown sugar and nuts stars for me
5,delicious i am a huge fan of the dressing and the grapes are just a reason to make it if i make this for a gathering ill add the pecans but for just me and my husband i can leave them off ive already shared this with my mom
5,made this recipe and cut the sugar in half no one knew the difference and it still tasted great very quick and easy to put together family loves it
5,this dish received rave reviews at a graduation open house it was loved by all ages i used the butterfinger topping and mixed some into the salad as well

5,i made this for the first time just because i love grapes my family agreed and it has become a favorite of my grandchildren as well cool refreshing different and not too sweet
5,i made this for thanksgiving very delicious
5,everybody loves this salad its easy and makes for a great bring something dish i really like it sans the brown sugar and nuts i think its perfect all by itself but the garnish does make it look better i make it at night and let it sit in fridge until the next day make sure grapes are dry before combining
5,this makes a huge salad so even for family events i half the recipe very good
5,my husbands family has been using this exact recipe for years its deceptively good we make it in a x pan and sprinkle the top with brown sugar and nuts walnuts are great here and pecans also work really well its definitely a goto potluck dish in our household never thought about adding chopped up candy bars but i can see how that would be delicious
5,this sweet salad drew raves at my easter dinnereven though i forgot to add the brown sugar and pecans at the end i add those to my leftovers and i really loved the added texture from the pecans the recipe makes a large amount making it perfect for a potluck i halved the recipe for a my smaller group and still had some left for the next day
5,i tasted this salad at a funeral years ago i could not get enough of it im so happy to have found the exact recipe here
5,easy and delicious
5,i make this for special holiday brunches my family loves it
5,one of my favorite goto recipes
5,huge hit with my family super easy to throw together have made many different variations with this recipe spicey sausage monteray jack cheese instead of swiss cheese and added a small jar of salsa for a delicious mexican twist meat lovers style with half of a pound of each sausage bacon and ham and veggy with sauteed red and yellow peppers spinach onion and mushrooms with sliced tomatoes on top all fantastic
5,ive made this numerous times with cottage cheese and even and it still tasted both great my father in law and husband who are not fans of cottage cheese loved it and wouldnt have even known there was cottage cheese in there i have also used part skim cheese and it didnt make a significant difference just to make recipe lighter i had a bag of potatoes to use up one time and chopped them into chunks and boiled them drained and used the recipe as is and they were delicious if you are looking to not use the frozen bag onesboth ways are phenomenal but the skim substitutes makes per serving a bit lighter for those who are not looking for those who are watching their waist line excellent recipe and is a go to when i have a huge brunch and family visiting in town
5,delicious next time i might try using sausage instead of bacon and adding green chilies or maybe not as it was good just the way it was definitely a winner
5,followed the recipe to a t and people devoured this very easy to put together which i did the day before and baked in the morning not great on the waste line but a definite keeper
5,this was awesome ive been looking for a great breakfast casserole for years and this is truly wonderful i made it initially for a weekly teacher breakfast at my school i thought i had made too much instead everyone gobbled it up and there was none left my only complaint is that i found it to be just a little bland the recipe calls for no additional spiceswhich i thought was sort of odd i browned the hash browns which takes forever good lord but otherwise followed the recipe exactly i made it the night before and then baked it in the morning before i left for work this also turned out quite well the second time i made it tonight i added a lot of salt and pepper to the eggs and the overall mixture i also added some truly excellent hot sauce my husband and i love to the eggs and into the whole mixture just a few dribbles i basically added blindly it turned out so well just gave it enough heat to be interesting but not overpowering my hot sauce is not for the faint of heartso if youre using something less insane like franks or sriracha you made need more additionally my swiss cheese bag was cupsi figured extra cheese makes everyone happier and i just added all of it d i think theres a lot of wiggle room to make it however it makes you happy but seriously make this its da bomb
5,excellent breakfast casserole i added green pepper and a little garlic to it also served it with salsa and sour cream this freezes well too i divided into two pans baked one and froze the other
5,this is great i used ham precooked
5,this is our alltime favorite breakfast casserole ive been making it for years you can add any kinds of cheeses any kind of meat or vegetables we like using c potatoes instead of and gruyere instead of swiss cheese thanks for sharing
5,prepared evening before then baked in morning used sausage onion and green pepper instead of bacon added tsp salt and pepper turned out great
5,delicious the only thing i changed was using pork sausage instead of bacon everyone had seconds
5,found this under the title of farmers casserole and have been making it every two days for just over two weeks and have made some changes use a slightly larger casserole dish and do not use frozen anything when the recipe states cup use full cup and no need to let it sit overnight prior to placing in the oven also the time it takes is tricky because it will depend on the ingredients used along with the size of the casserole dish we will place lightly a sheet of aluminum foil over the top for the first minutes so it wont crust over too badly plus the seasonings need to be adjusted according to your familys tastes buen provecho
5,before i retired i frequently add this casserole for a morning treat for my coworkers and occasionally sent it with my hubby to his job everyone loves it even folks who cringe when you mention cottage cheese it really does just melt right in i usually use build pork sausage like jimmy dean because you can get it together without the mess of cooking up bacon and i increase the amounts of most everything when taking to a groupexact amounts have never seemed to be too importantthe outcome is always great like some others commenting ive frequently added diced sweet peppers i also make a smaller version in a skillet and bake that for just us at home try this one im sure it will become one of your faves too
5,my family and friends love this recipe its easy to make and versatile sometimes i use ham or sausage instead or add veggies like peppers or change out the kinds of cheese just depends on whats in my refrigerator its a go to favorite recipe to bring somewhere or eat at home
5,this was great i did add salt and pepper and reserved some of the cheese for the top
5,this is perfect for an office potluck or anytime you need to bring a quick treat to a party the green grapes are perfect for christmas so delicious and addicting note i left off the brown sugar was already sweet enough for me
5,this is an absolutely fabulous salad im guessing ive made this at least a dozen times since i got the recipe the summer of just for fun the other day i added some blueberries and they were so good in there i use it as a dessert when im craving something sweet i mix at least a cup or so of chopped walnuts or pecans in instead of sprinkling over the top and i didnt care so much for the brown sugar so dont use it at all this is my favorite salad by far wish i could give it ten stars
5,my grandkids that dont like fruit salads loved this thanks you its great
5,everyone loves this recipe for summer i tried a variation i substituted fresh strawberries for the red grapes it was delicious too
5,i took this to a family reunion today and everybody raved about it and i do mean raved the bowl came back empty and i had offers to lick the bowl this is a winner

5,made this to take to a friend it was sooo good and shes still talking about it
5,this grape salad was fabulous it is fast uses few ingredients and a great taste i made it the night before and it held up well i used sour cream and it gave it a tangy flavor i will make it again
5,had this salad a number of years ago at a funeral everybody raved about it didnt really have a recipe per se so i winged it and it turned out great after reading some of these reviews its always left up to a persons personal tastes the dressing is supposed to be a bit thick so it sticks to the grapes and doesnt leave a runny mess at the bottom makes for a great salad in the summer on a hot day
5,when we moved to the south in this was the first recipe i had to have everyone loves it from kids to adults its very refreshing
5,my family thoroughly enjoyed this tasty grape salad it packs well for our picnics at soccer tournaments my family often requests this salad thank you for sharing your recipe
5,this is always a hitwe call it groovy grapes
5,i have had a similar recipe for years and everyone always wants me to make it for showers and reunions my recipe calls for almond extract and a little brown sugar in the dressing also but is otherwise the same the biggest challenge to me is getting the grapes dry after washing so that the dressing sticks otherwise it just slides off not a cheap dish but certainly tasty and someone always asks for the recipe
5,wow who would ever thought grapes could taste would be so outstanding as a salad i did not add brown sugar or nuts and still be sowow i look forward to creamy grape saladthank you for this recipe

5,reminds me of cheesecake i have a new potluck dish now
5,very delicious i made it for a graduation open house and got lots of requests for the recipe i too used the lower fat cream cheese and sour cream i found that the total amount of brown sugar and nuts was a bit more than really necessary for the presentation in the bowl i used

5,absolutely amazing and so quick to whip up refreshing salad with great color to compliment any meal tasty with cinnamon crusted pecans crushed on top helpful hint allowing the grapes to dry after rinsing made the cream cheese mixture stick to the grapes much better
5,i have made this for years and always get rave reviews i prefer it with grapes but have made it with many fruits it is pretty good with blueberries and strawberries on the th of july the only thing i do differently is to combine the pecans and the brown sugar and sprinkle it on the salad before i refrigerate it for several hours right before i serve it i give it a final stir to mix it in the brown sugar melts a little bit into the pecans and is not quite as grainy
5,this is a great salad i put praline peacans chopped on top instead of the brown sugar and got rave reviews

5,the best ever
5,this is one of those recipes that have become a staple at family get togethers everyone loves it i always substitute neufchâtel cheese and fat free sour cream and no one knows the difference
5,this is a great recipe id always considered that doing anything to grapes except eating them right off the bunch was gilding the lily but after tasting this i decided if you are going to gild this was the gilding to do id never made this myself before today though we had a bunch of white grapes that were just a bit too tart for us to enjoy eating by themselves so i mixed this up its so quick and so easy and very forgiving of substitutionsi found that i didnt have sour cream so used plain greek yogurt and then discovered that id accidentally grabbed fat free cream cheese at the store which is a slightly different creature to me than regular or lowfat and i had no pecans so i chopped up some almonds even with all that this came out wonderfully and tasted very similar to what ive had in the past at various gatherings
5,in my younger years waldorf salad was my fav but some years ago i added halved grapes cooked shell noodles and some chopped roasted chicken diced peppers any colori also toasted the pecans before adding them to the saladwhat a wonderful summertime saladcool n refreshing

5,i have been making this recipe for years and we love it my kids have affectionately renamed it eyeball salad since in a clear bowl thats what it kind of looks like i put the nuts and brown sugar on top several hours before serving and it starts to carmelize on top and makes it even better i also increase the brown sugar on top

5,this is such a good dessert and so easy to put together great for summer

5,our soninlaw loves anything peanut butterthis one is a keeper delicious and easy to put together i keep the ingredients on hand for this one
5,love love this recipe when i bring it to potlucks people always ask for the recipe
5,i know ive already commented on this recipe years ago but a lady i dont even know just refound it the recipe for me i could not find this for the life of me and im so thankful it was found for me by a kind incredible personif you havent made this its time especially now with holidays fully upon usyou will be so glad you did as will the friendsfolksfamily who are delving into its lusciousness
5,my husband and i and our two guests absolutely loved this dessert the only change i made was to add cup of confectioners sugar to the cream cheese and omit it from the pudding mix as per anothers review it was perfect will make often
5,made this dessert for a potluck my husband and i attended and everyone absolutely loved it i will definitely make it again
5,this recipe has everything a person with a sweet tooth probably loves peanut butter cups pudding whipped topping and oreos i dont usually like peanut butter in things except a sandwich but for this delectable dessert i changed my mind
5,i was worried the peanut butter cups would make this sweeter than i could handle so i swapped out the cups for crushed nutter butter cookies and a tiny sprinkling of kosher salt wowww highly recommend
5,i have had this with splenda and its just as good also have used almond instead of vanilla for a stronger flavor
5,i had this at a pot luck at work and a coworker refused to give me the recipe only thing different is she used crushed butterfingers on top and it was awesome thanks for the recipe
5,i had this at a baby shower and loved it i have shared the recipe with many others and have made several times and always get rave reviews
5,i have made this several times and our grandchildren love this salad and think it is a wonderful treat
5,this is delicious this is the second time i have made it for two groups of people and it has been loved by everyone this will stay in my dessert rotation for sure
5,i made this for a family get together and everyone loved it will definitely make again
5,this is really flippin good i kno i will make and be asked to make it againits super crazy sweet tho i will leave the powdered sugar out altogether in the future i put about a cup in with the cream cheese only bc i had sugar free pb its still borderline too sweet thowe used the butterfinger bits instead of the reeses tooand a little tip for the oreos i used an already made oreo pie crust for that it holds together better to spread the cream chesse on top i just dumped it in the bottom of the casserole dish i used and sorta smashed it down to cover the whole bottomstill ridiculously good for mins of work
5,delicious dessert i used the new peanut butter filled oreos for the base and to sprinkle on top and that really put it over the top i also found a big jar of truly miniature peanut butter cups about the size of a large chocolate chip at our local mennonite store and used those rather than chopping up peanut butter cups a wonderful cool treat on a very hot summer day
5,excellent dessert i actually had someone who doesnt like sweets say that he loved this recipe because of the peanut butter taste it is really sweet but thats the point anything that puts chocolate and peanut butter together is going to taste great i used lowfat nofat items where i could but no one would know
5,this was very good i placed this in a x pan i just needed to crush up a few more oreos for the crust to fill the bottom of the pan i normally dont adjust recipes prior to making them the first time but several people commented about the sweetness of this dessert so i only added cup of powdered sugar to the cream cheesepeanut butter mixture and none to the chocolate pudding this was perfect for us everyone at the party loved it id definately make it again
5,so rich so sweet a little dab will do you impressive to take to parties
5,i have made this several times took it to work to share and even the people who said they only wanted a little bit came back for big second helpings delish
5,delicious but very rich could reduce the amount of confectioners sugar and it would still be sweet enough a x pan is not big enough for a doubled recipe
5,this was a big hit as a volunteer field editor for toh i enjoy testing new recipes as others have suggested it is very rich and a small serving goes a long way very simple to make and a crowd favourite for sure
5,the first time i made this my family and i was super impressed and it has become the most requested dessert for sunday dinners
5,sounds delicious right now and im loving it and im looking forward to making it some day
5,there are really good desserts then there are great desserts this one falls under great desserts its rich and smooth with a variety of flavors and textures that marry together for a party in your mouth a hard to earn stars from me
5,yummy rich smooth flavor leftovers didnt last long
5,absolutely heavenly left out the peanut butter cups might have been overkill it was a hit
5,ive made this same recipe but use a roll of sausage instead of bacon and i use shredded mozzarella cheese instead of cottage cheese
5,i have made this several times my family loves it it also reheat and freezes well ive made it with different kinds of meat and cheeses very easy to make ive made it where i prepared it and baked it right away and ive made it where i prepared it put in the refrigerator and baked it the next morning both ways are great
5,this recipe has great reviews because it is a great recipe so simple and easy yet so delicious i just added a touch of salt and pepper perfect for brunch
5,
5,this is a great recipe for the holidays i use bacon italian sausage
5,this was a delicious casserole we liked it so well we ate it for breakfast then had leftovers for supper i subbed ham for the bacon and added some bell peppers so good even the hubby was raving about it lol
5,i have used this recipe for years i always mix it together on christmas eve and just pop it in the oven christmas morning i love to add a small can or two of hatch chiles i mention it on my blog here wwwmaternitydessertcom
5,great breakfast for everyone
5,my family absolutely loves this recipe we have it every christmas morning its so easy to make the night before and then i pop it in the oven in the morning before everyone wakes up i didnt think i would like it because of the cottage cheese but its delicious
5,delicious what is the best way to freeze and then thaw out
5,i made this recipe as is but i did cut it in half and it was delicious reading other comments i was surprised to read some of the negative comments this was excellent and i do not know why theirs did not taste great oh well my opinion is this was so easy and i had all the ingredients so i did not have to go out of my house at this time thanks for sharing it
5,this is probably a good recipe but i think it would be much better if some milk was added to loosen it up
5,i love this recipe i made it for my husband to take to a work dessert contest and won first place im diabetic so i tweaked the recipe a little to make it a little lower in sugar i use light whipped topping and sugar free pudding
5,the only thing wrong with this is its too awesome i cant quit eating it
5,i did not find it to sweet being that i have made many other desserts that had way to much sugari think the pudding helps i will make it again
5,wow this was simple delicious and a huge hit at work i added extra peanut butter cups to the top because there can never be enough
5,made this for my grandson age and he loved it popped the remainder in the freezer just to see what would happen and it froze very well now i can have it on hand whenever he stops by and is craving some chocolate
5,absolutely decadent next time i would combine the pudding with the powdered sugar before adding the milk to prevent clumping and used maybe a little bigger pan as mine was overflowing
5,omg this is wonderful served it for a family dinner and it was a huge hit will make often
5,mine is currently in the fridge setting right now so i havent even eaten it yet except for a few tastes here and there but so far its delicious while prepping this i popped my unwrapped peanut butter cups in the freezer while i worked on step that way they were firm and easier to chop
5,love love my family loved it
5,i opted for a x pan and totally happy with the result i used a few more cookies for bottom crust to insure coverage all finished the dessert fills the pan to within of top edge
5,this was delicious anyone have problem with oreo crust not sticking

5,this was amazing i made it for my boyfriends birthday and then for christmas eve everyone loved itone of the complaints was that it was too sweet i made it with sugar free cool whip and chocolate pudding and light pb it was not to rich just do not use light or reduced fat cream cheese because it changes the consistency

5,all i can say iswow this dessert is absolutely one of the best i have ever had so easy because you dont even have to bake it it was a huge hit i do have to add that i accidentally bought an oz container of whipped topping misread the recipe and i almost panicked but since i didnt discover it until too l ate i had no choice but to just split that one as far as i know it worked out fine i am wondering now if its better this way
5,wow this was really tasty it is extremely filling so a little goes quite a long way we used more oreos than the package called for because i wanted them to fill the bottom of the pan this was fun to make with the kids and everyone absolutely loved it i will absolutely make this again for a party

5,my family and friends loved this on easter day
5,i was a little intimidated by this recipe at first but it turned out beautifully to make it easier to crush the cookies i put them in the fridge to get cold then placed in a sandwich bagand using a mallet pounded the cookies till they were crushed i also placed the peanut butter cups in the fridge to make cutting them easier everyone loved this recipe and i make it as the recipe states the presentation was awesome
5,excellent dessert my fiance absolutely loved it and has already asked if i can make it again i used chunky peanut butter instead of creamy as well and it turned out really well it was a nice way to put that much needed crunch in the middle of all the deliscious creamyness it a winner in this house and will certainly be used again thank you
5,got rave reviews at easter when i served this was the best dessert i have had in a long time
5,yes crush the whole cream filled chocolate cookies youll have delicious black and white crumbs for the crust
5,fabulous anyone know how to convert the ingredients to fit a x pan
5,this came out fantastic made it for my inlaws birthday and the entire family gobbled it up d next time i want to try freezing it though it was very good right out of the fridge
5,this got rave reviews when i served it to friends so rich creamy and delicious have a glass of milk handy when you eat it its amazing
5,fantastic everyone loved it one small thing i would change is to omit the cup of confectioners sugar in the pudding layer its plenty sweet alreadyfor the reviewer whose pudding layer didnt set up dont forget to let the pudding stand until softset i put mine into the refrigerator for this stepfor the reviewer asking whether to leave the cream on the cookies yes leave it on
5,for spellcheck technically you would do recipe for a x pan but for ease of making just double everything it makes it a bit thicker but oh so yummy
5,very rich but delicious my family loved it
5,absolutely beautifulgushing with flavour and such a strong taste of beauty
5,it was rich but very good i made it for a summer holiday dinner and it was a big hit
5,this recipe takes a little time to do each layer has its own prep workbut it is worth the effort my family loved this nobake very rich dessert
5,very rich but oh so tasty
5,i happened to have oreo cookies with green mint filling and used this for the recipe it was delicious
5,made it for fathers day and everyone loved it was not hard to make did not find it over rich i did add more peanut butter cups would make it again
5,i made this dessert on memorial day and for a family dinner yesterday it was thoroughly enjoyed both times the recipe is easy to put together and comes in handy on hot summer days no baking required the first time i made it i didnt put the whipped topping in the peanut butter and cream cheese layer and it still turned out great i suggest using a dish larger than square and adding more crushed cookies for the crust
5,this recipe is awesome everyone that tried it wanted the recipe very rich have made it several time i want to eat the whole pan myself and not share lol
5,i first made this dessert when i found it in the taste of home several years ago it was fantastic and a huge hit with the family i get requests for it from family when we are getting together to celebrate
5,my husband is the big sweet eater in the family and he is picky about his food he gave this stars all the way
5,this is lucious made it for teachers for a dinner and everyone raved over it none left
5,but my pudding layer did not set it was runny i left it off
5,this was a excellant dessert and a total hit with myself and family
5,simple and what is there not to love about chocolate and peanut butter very rich and so very delicious
5,so delicious this dessert is easy to make and it is such a nice alternative to the typical dessert of cookies or cake it is so thick and rich that you dont need a lot of it to feel satisfied so it feeds a lot of people the best part is that its easy to make healthier by using reducedfat oreos cream cheese peanut butter whipped topping and milk cannot wait to make this dessert again
5,this is one of the best desserts i have ever had everyone always requests me to make this for all of our familyfriends gettogethers i would suggest buying the bag of mini reeses peanut butter cups to save time on unwrapping and chopping the larger peanut butter cups
5,this was awsome the taste of peanut butter was soooo good thanks again
5,made this for a christmas family gathering and everyone loved it i took an empty dish home
5,one of faiths faves
5,out of this world easy to make and it was a big hit will make it again but will double the recipesrich but delicious
5,amazing best combination ever i cant wait to try this recipe you are a genius thank you for sharing
5,wonderful i make a makeover version of this would love to know the new nutrition facts its still bad for you but not as bad tbsp butter to cup confect sugar mixed with the cr cheese and pb no sugar added to pudding mix made with skim milk use light whipped topping still decadent
5,a big hit especially for peanut butter lovers
5,i used bottom round roast put carrots and potatoes under roast and used quart of beef broth instead of water on low for hours then thickened it with corn starch amazing although the gravy is so delicious it would be even better on mashed potatoes
5,added carrots and potatoes beef broth in place of water plus thickened liquid with corn starch to complete the meal this has been a family favorite for years
5,this was heaven yum
5,i absolutely love the marriage between chocolate and peanut butter so when i saw this i had to make it it was so good that my friend and i ate it until we were insanely full and didnt feel good anymore so the amount this recipe calls forgoes a long way for a lot of guests since its so rick also crush your cookies very well use more butter and melt it so that your crust remains in tack excellent im making it again tonight for a company bbq
5,everyone at work went crazy for this it is delicious and very richwill definitely make it again
5,this recipe always gets compliments when i make it for company i usually use the lower fat neufchatel cream cheese and it turns out great ive also made this recipe using the smaller container of whipped topping for a denser consistency both ways work fine great recipe
5,this was an instant favorite instead of the cookie crust i broke up some leftover brownies i also layered mine in a clear glass bowl alternating each layer at least twiceit just dressed it up a little and added some eyeappeal
5,i made this for the first time about years agoevery time ive made it i never have any leftovers
5,greatnext time im going to try freezing it and taking in out min before
5,this dessert was much better frozen
5,i used a x dish so i added a little extra of everything very yummy i served frozen
5,making this for a second time in two weeks this dessert is fabulous and definitely better frozen just holds together better and resembles icecream cake in a way the first night that i made this a family member requested that i bring this to their next birthday event
5,i purchased the edition oftaste of home prize winning recipes at the beach i continue to use the recipes in this magazine on a regular basis the peanut butter chocolate dessert recipe is to die for and yes i will make it again and again
5,really good recipe everyone really enjoyed it and it does taste even better frozen
5,i have made this dessert many times for friends and family everyone enjoys and always wants seconds i have also modified it into just a peanut butter pie its quick and easy and very delicious
5,marilyn linn in recipes like this do not remove the cream filling but make sure you crush the cookies as finely as possible so they make a better crust enjoy
5,ive been making this recipe for twenty years i only use one boneless chuck roast and put potatoes and carrot chunks under it and cook at in the oven in my covered dutch oven for about two and a half hours i also use a bit more water to make sure i have enough of the gravy
5,i didnt change a thing my family loved it very flavorful and fall apart tender
5,this is the first recipe review i have ever given and this recipe deserves all the accolades it can possibly get i am not even a big meat eater but i have made this pot roast twice in the past month i hate salty food and i didnt find this this salty at all i only made one roast and slid a few chopped up potatoes carrots onions and garlic cloves under it to make it all fit in my quart crockpot i also added cup of water to the recipe because i love the gravy my family likes the beef which totally falls apart and potatoes while i favor the gravy and carrots we all enjoy it over rice pilaf it smells so good while its simmering merrily in the crockpot try it tonight
5,this is a super recipe since its just the two of us i used just one roast i also omitted the ranch dressing mix because we despise the flavor
5,so easy and the best tasting ever whole family loves this one
5,absolutely delicious and so very easy to make the only change i made was to use two small arm roasts that i had on hand rather than chuck roast the gravy was delicious i will definitely be making this my goto pot roast recipe from now on
5,made this in the crock pot last sunday yummy this will be my go to recipe very easy to make
5,very tasty and very easy to make
5,we love this recipe easy and great taste
5,tried this on sunday and it was delicious the meat melted in your mouth and it had so much flavor i did however first season the roast with meat tenderizer salt pepper garlic powder and then browned it in olive oil and the put in the crockpot then poured the mixture in the fry pan scrapping up the browned bits from the bottom poured over the meat and added another cup of water cooked for hrs and it was falling apart so tender will definitely make again
5,easy tasty recipe many reviewers found it too salty i wonder if they are only using one roast i used two roasts totaling about pounds the flavor reminded me of a french dip i plan to shred the second roast make some tasty homemade bread add some swiss cheese and use the remaining broth as french dip or perhaps do an open faced sandwich yum
5,to tsuop this is delicious nowhere does the contributor say it is home made if you cant say anything nice find a home made recipe and move on
5,i though this pot roast was excellent after its cooked i shred it up and thicken the juices with some cornstarch then add the meat back into the juice very yummy
5,i am the years young chief cook and bottle washer in our home i made this recipe exactly as posted and it was deliciious juicy and tender i put the juices in a small pan and thickened the gravy with tbs flour whisked in cup water and served it with mashed potatoes and green beans i got rave reviews from my wife of years love your recipes keep up the great work
5,when me and my friends go to the shore we always make this recipe because everyone loves it we just add a little green pepper to it great to make for a group of people
5,super easy to make and absolutely delicious my husband does not like anything with cottage cheese but he didnt even know there was any in it and he had three servings this will be my new go to
5,was so happy with how this recipe turned out i needed a breakfast casserole for a girls weekend getaway amp this recipe really came through it sounded simple in ingredients amp instruction big plusingredients were readily on hand the only changes i made was to substitute the swiss cheese with pepper jack cheese amp added a dash of granulated garlic chopped green chilies sounded good as well but i didnt have any on handnext time the casserole was so flavorful everyone enjoyed it i will definitely be making this recipe again
5,i made this exactly as the recipe is here with ham for us and for a neighbor amazing i was tempted to add salt and pepper but really didnt need to my husband is not a fan of casseroles but loved this one it is quick easy and absolutely delicious thank you
5,good recipe even the old boy enjoyed it
5,all ages loved this recipe i make lots of breakfast casseroles when we travel or when having company i have my favorites that i have rotated for the last plus years and occasionally try new ones now i have favorites because this one is a definite keeper i did exactly as the recipe called for and it turned out perfect the suggestion about green chilis sounds wonderful and i may try that next time but honestly it doesnt need it for flavor it seriously was perfect as is thank you for sharing
5,this came out delicious and i have to confess i modified itokaychanged it due to what i had in the fridge i used lb of italian sausage monterey jack cheese only fresh spinach and baked frozen tater tots minutes i didnt mix it altogether but built it like a quiche meatonionsspinach mixture on the bottom monterey jack cheese and then the egg cheese and cottage cheese mixture topped it with more jack cheese and i baked it in my x ceramic dish and it was amazing i was a little reluctant to serve it for breakfast as it might be a better lunch or dinner entree but hubby thought it was terrific next time i make it and there will be a next time im going to follow the recipe so ill have a comparison but i think whatever you do this recipe will always taste amazing thanks for sharing
5,i make this every year for christmas morning breakfast its delicious i use eggs per the recipe i have everything else is the same
5,family favorite i add eggs because its an egg casserole i use spicy chicken sausage instead of bacon sometimes
5,have been making this one for years i did alter for our taste i use lb bacon and lb ham i add jalapeños and use eggs please note this requires a longer baking time i plan for an hour and a half as i let it stand for minutes before serving
5,i made this on christmas eve to serve christmas morning i am so glad i did it was easy and deliciouseven reheated great with a splash of milk to loosen it up a few days later this is a keeper and great to use when you want to save yourself time on a holiday or when you have guests

5,my family has enjoyed this dish for years now everyone loves this meal
5,loved this recipe the only thing that i changed was i substituted with oz of beef broth and added diced golden potatoes with carrots excellent recipe
5,did a pot roast with half the mixes and turned out perfect only there wasnt much gravy and i added c water and didnt add beef bouillon to make up for it so it wasnt as tasty as it could have been i served the gravy over the roast and mashed potatoes my husband is a chef and he said the roast was amazing and moist i will make this from now on but will make sure to make the gravy to match
5,family favorite my daughter first made this amp we thought it too salty too so she recommended when i make it add packets of ranch amp italian dressing mix amp use lower sodium gravy mix i do amp that helps lower sodium very easy tasty
5,i made some mashed potatoes and served the meat over the potatoes and there were no leftovers i used beef stock instead of water and this was the most flavorful roast ive ever had definitely making it again
5,salty but perfect over mashed potatoes will definitely be making this again
5,this is my favorite pot roast ive been making it for years and it is always very good i sometimes just buy stew meat add some potatoes and carrots and do the same thing
5,one of my favorite recipes but i also add a stick of butter superb
5,i used canned beef gravy and it was delicious i read the shopping list wrong so i went for it
5,amazing we loved this dish and it was so easy to make i used about lbs of pork roast and chuck roast my mom swears by combining both roasts in a pan i cooked them in a dutch oven in the oven for an hour at then for about more hours at the meat was so tender and flavorful i will definitely make this again soon

5,yummy
5,my husband absolutely loves roast this way his absolute favorite and mine as well since it is so easy
5,this is an excellent recipe yes it has less eggs than most breakfast casseroles it is more of a hashbrown casserole than egg casserole and thats ok i made this for my dils baby shower and got many compliments and requests for the recipe
5,this is by far my favorite breakfast casserole it is always a hit i made it just like the recipe above the first time and it was good now i add extra eggs for a total of i also use mortons nature seasoning i do bacon the majority of the time but have added sausage as well i also use simply potatoes hash browns in place of frozen

5,this is so easy to make i used bacon and it was delicious and easy we did this as breakfast for dinner but i will use this for breakfast when i have company for the holidays
5,delicious as written and so easy to change up for personal preference even my cottage cheese haters loved it i run my cottage cheese through the food processor to give it the consistency of ricotta just takes a minute or two i use this hack for lasagne too
5,loved thisfollowed to the letterwell i did sprinkle extra cheese on top last few minutes can never have too much cheese have never eaten this sort of hot dish before and first time making it did do half recipe in x panand mixed up at nightkept in fridgebaked next daygreat resultsthank you for sharing this recipe
5,ive made this for several family gatherings and everyone raves about it and wants the recipe it is so cheesy and good
5,this was an very tasty recipe i used jimmy dean turkey sausage links cut up instead of bacon i also added a small amount of diced green pepper with the onion i used fat free cheddar jack shredded cheese plus the swiss cheese i did of the recipe and put it in muffin tin it was amazing do try it
5,saved this to my home screen folder and will be making it this weekend for dinner thanks for sharing edit made this tonight for dinner we dont really care for swiss cheese and we couldnt find gruyere so i subbed about cup of parmigianoreggiano and i used scallions instead of white sweet onion because they give egg dishes a metal taste didnt need but a half of a teaspoon of kosher salt and about a teaspoon of white pepper i also added some diced green pepper and we both loved it next time i will grate some fresh garlic and sauté the vegetables separately from the bacon delicious definitely a keeper
5,this is my go to breakfast casserole i like to add cooked asparagus and extra cheese definitely worth the calories easy to make the night before and bake in the morning
5,i really enjoyed this dish and made it as written cut in half and used simply potatoes for the hash brown component it was an excellent breakfast twice in the future ill probably cut back on the bacon or use leftover ham
5,yummy yummy due to high fat and salt content this is our once a year treat but yummy
5,ive made this many times and its wonderful ive taken it to different potluck breakfasts and to the home bound and receive many compliments you can easily change things to suit your taste and can change the cheeses but the swiss really does make this stand out
5,i love this recipe ive made it several time and always end up with a clean dish i add extra bacon natures seasoning and use simply potatoes for convenience i make it the night before and take it out the next morning and cook its my go to casserole
5,the family loved this will make again
5,the whole family loved this one
5,this recipe is an absolute keeper ive made it many times since i found it on the website and its a huge family favorite
5,great pot roast recipe pot roast is not usually a favorite with my husband amp i but this recipe really appealed to us hubby kept complimenting me all night very tender juicy amp tasty i cooked it with potatoes onions amp carrots i also used bit more water about cup brought back memories of my moms pot roast when she made it in a pressure cooker
5,made it tonight and everyone loved it its easy didnt over or undercook and tasted great i added some carrots and potatoes about hrs into it then from the suggestion of another member added cornstarch to thicken the liquid to use as gravy
5,i didnt have dry salad dressing envelopes in the pantry so i used bottled zesty italian and ranch dressing about cup apiece with a jar of savory beef gravy carrots in the pot with it and about six and a half hours cook time only did one potroast of about lbs just delicious and enough gravy to throw over rice great recipe
5,fantastic and easyi almost got the wrong size brown gravy envelopegot the smaller one and threw vegetables in and everything was fine i dont like salty and it wasnt
5,so easy and delicious the meat was incredibly tender i didnt have brown gravy mix so i just stirred beef bullion and cornstarch into the water
5,this is one of my goto recipes the flavor is awesome
5,love this recipe i add potatoes on the bottom of the slow cooker and then chopped onions and whole baby carrots i use two of each dressing mix and gravy mix and pour on top of all the beef carrots and potatoes and let it cook for hrs this makes a quick and easy sunday dinner
5,one of our favorite recipes
5,my family said this was the best roast i have ever made i used a lb roast and layered onions carrots and new potatoes cut in half underneath the meat for me it took the full cooking time
5,very good a little on the tangy side from the italian dressing which i enjoy but if you have family members who do not just use a half a packet or less of italian dressing i usually uuse a pound roast so i just do two of ranch of brown gravy and of italian dressing in a cup of water when i thinken the juices for gravy i just add some corn starch or flour to some cold waterbefore i mixit in to the juices to avoid lumps the best part is it is so easy yet tastes so good
5,this was super easy flavorful and tender
5,truly excellent i will not make a roast any other way now i do up the water to one cup so there is more gravy
5,easy and tasty this is a truly amazing recipe my only complaint is that there wasnt enough
5,although this is delicious just the way its shown i find we like it even better with a can of cream of mushroom soup stirred into the sauce this increases the gravy and gives it a nice creamy texture it has a delicious flavor prepared this way
5,i agree with carrie i wont make roast any other way i cut the recipe in half for my family and save the other half of the dressing and sauce mixes in a ziploc bag so theyll be ready for the next time
5,one of my favorites to make when serving a pot roast
5,amazing my whole family loved this recipe from now on i wont be making my roast any other way sooo good
5,amazing flavor and so easy the only roast recipe for my family from now on
5,one of the best pot roast i have made and will make again from now on
5,my whole family loves this recipe i make it at least once a month i add either baby carrots or chunks of carrots to itthats my favorite part i let the carrots cook the entire popnmimyou can add potatoes too but i prefer to make creamed potatoes to go with it
5,i made this the first time for company an they loved it lol even took some to work cold a keeper
5,this is delicious i made this for some picky company and they even asked for the recipe
5,very easy recipe i make regularly for my family i add a bag of carrots and make sure to make mashed potatoes for this one
5,this recipe definitely lives up to its name however id like to try it with sirloin tips next time i did add a normandy veggie mix to this towards the end of cooking i served it with loaded mashed potatoes and the fam loved it
5,im not a big meateater but this roast was fabulous i used a three pound roast and threw in carrots celery potatoes onions and mushrooms the roast was extremely tender and juicy i cant wait to make it again
5,my husband still hasnt stopped talking about how great this is i only cooked roast and my husband had of it by himself one of my sons had the other and the nd son daughter amp i had none since there was none left usually roast sits in the fridge for days leftover so i expected the same result not with this recipe i may have to buy a couple more crockpots to keep up with the demand
5,i made this once and now my family wants this all the time it is wonderful a must try thank you for this recipe
5,excellent and simple recipe i also added potatoes and carrots to make it a complete dinner my husband loved it and is already requesting it again
5,we enjoyed this recipe as written the first few times i made it last time i added a can of cream of mushroom soup and it was even tastier it adds flavor and makes a creamier gravy
5,so easy and truly excellent my year old asked for rd helpings and my husband told me it was the best meat he has ever eaten i can honestly say i dont think i would make a pot roast any other way after this i did up the water to one cup for more gravy delicious
5,this was amazing i will only make pot roast this way from now on
5,roast beef can some times be boring but not this recipe excellent
5,absolutely delicious flavor and so tender it practically melts in your mouth definitely a winner
5,very very good even my mother in law who is a very tough critic loved it
5,oh yes makes sunday dinner a breeze i added carrot chunks to make it a full dinner with mashed potatoes the only criticism i have is the gravy needs to be thicker maybe adding a tablespoon or so of cornstarch the last half hour would do it love this easy recipe
5,amazing is all i have to say i just used a large lb roast instead of the smaller ones i also threw it in the crock pot frozen and put it on high for about an hour and then down to low for hours and it was great and dont forget about the gravy it makes wow and all of our dinner guests people loved it too
5,so easy and so delicious
5,it was delicious and my boyfriend just asked me to make it again for the rd timei was afraid to try the vegetables due to the comments but im going to try them and see how they come out after the last comment said they were fine
5,ive made a lot of different pot roast recipes but this is by far the family favorite it has so much flavor its now the only recipe i use
5,i have never been much on beef roast i just didnt like the taste of it the only use i had for a beef roast was to cook and shred it to make vegetable soup i have to admit the combination of the dressings just didnt sound like they went with roast but after reading all the reviews i wanted to try it boy am i glad i did i was still skeptical even as i mixed the packets together to pour over the meat but one taste put all skepticism to rest i made gravy from the juices and it was delicious ive even thought of other ways i can use this combination of seasonings for other beef dishes thanks so much for sharing
5,incredibly simply and tastes amazing

5,wow this pumpkin bread is amazing my husband and i couldnt stop raving about it the only revision i made to the recipe was i used the whole can of pumpkin purée like a few other reviewers did as not to waste the pumpkin instead of making two loaves i also omitted using the cup of water like the others did i appreciate their advice because this was magnificent and no other changes are needed i used cup of raisins in it which tasted perfect this pumpkin bread is a keeper thank you joyce for posting this great recipe
5,fantastic i too omitted the water amp used full can of pumpkin
5,such a great recipe everyone loved it
5,pdelicious i too opted to use a full can of pumpkin and skip the water what else r u doing to do with a left over half can i added raisins walnuts and then topped it off with a crumble butter brown sugar sugar cinnamon and oats its amazing i even made muffins out of the second batch p
5,this is outrageously good and easy you really should try this as all i have shared it with wind up making it more than once not only is the roast very flavorful it makes very good gravy as well a winner

5,i am not a fan of cottage cheese at all outside of substituted for ricotta in lasagna i made this exactly as written it was so easy to put together and so good it was even better reheated for leftovers thank you for this wonderful recipe it could have many substitutions as in meat or cheese and perhaps veggies thrown in i could not get over how flavor filled it was just a total joy to put in my mouth
5,delicious i use lb ground beef and make it a day before i plan to serve it as we think its better the second day

5,this is a great recipe filling enough for a full supper with maybe some homemade bread on the side too you can use any leftover veggies you may want to add to this too
5,a kid pleaser in my house this quickly became a family favorite
5,we enjoy this recipe but felt the cheese content was too much so we use kraft cheese singles about slices and it still maintains the great flavor
5,my daughter loves this soup she begs me to make it
5,we could eat this once a week during the codler months of the year and never get tired of it
5,love it i have passed this recipe on to my children and their children also love it its a fall and winter staple
5,i have been making this recipe since it was first published in it is a family favorite that i make at least once a month fall through spring i add a bit of cayenne or tabasco for my family who likes food zippy wonderful recipe i also have found that using frozen hash browns is a timesaver
5,ive made this twice so far it will be my goto pumpkin bread recipe its a very adaptable recipe and ill probably make it a little different each time ill never use c of sugar thats for sure today i used th cup and its perfectly sweet
5,this was fantastic pumpkin bread these should actually be referred to as cakes used fresh baked pumpkin ground up the cloves and cinnamon sticks because its all i had in hand used standard cane sugar and some maple syrup and subbed all baking powder for the baking soda still turned out fantastic one thing i love about this recipe is that it uses c water instead if just going for the entire cup of canola oil as less healthier recipes do would also try adding or teaspoons of vanilla next time forget canned pumpkin and used fresh if you can it makes a world of difference
5,this was very good i cut back on the sugar and nutmeg due to my tastes it was very moist everyone loved it
5,i just finished making of these breads plus made with stevia for a diabetic friend they were easy andcame out looking great they smell divine so i am hoping they taste that way as well
5,this is a very flexible recipei added about to cups of fresh pumpkin pure which i make from our jackolantern and freeze and was generous with the nuts and spices and it came out great both times it needs to bake for about hour and minutes so just make sure you test it yum
5,i added just a few ounces of sarcasm and a pinch of annoyancethis bread turned out perfectly baked for minutes and are you readyactually followed the recipe as written and am reviewing it as it was written i guess im living on the edge or something it was moist delicious and guess whatperfectly sweetened i wondered about the cups of sugar but figured that since i was following a recipei should actually i dont knowfollow the recipe i highly recommend trying this and maybe even following the recipe as written to get the best results
5,ive made alot of recipes for pumpkin bread but this might be the best inused pecans as i was out of walnuts no raisins but did add a bit of cinnamon the nutmeg and clove ratios were wonderful fulldiscloaure i used peanut oil instead of canola it was delicious
5,this was rich and really good i see it was submitted by someone in nova scotia i visit there a lot and everything from nova scotia is delicious
5,so easy and so delicious
5,i did this recipe and was soooo delicious it came out so rich and moist definitely doing this again
5,i love this bread ive made double recipes all four times once i made it vegan which was the only time that the bread didnt fall apart and leave its bottom in the pan tried waiting ten minutes tried waiting fifteen minutes what am i doing wrong i love to give this as presents but it looks kind of weird with the bottom coming off
5,made this for the first time this evening i did take one reviewers advice and used the whole can of pumpkin and omitted the water i also didnt use cloves because i dont like the flavor of them baked for min in a glass pan and it came out perfectly it is wonderful with a pat of butter while still warm will definitely make this again
5,this will be my go to recipe from now on for pumpkin bread i followed the directions exactly as stated and it came out perfect
5,i tweaked this recipe by cutting back on the sugar using c brown sugar raw sugar used soaked figs and saved cup of that water in place of the regular water the figs gave added fiber without changing the flavor i will definitely be making this again
5,i usually follow recipes to the tee but i didnt want to waste any pumpkin so i used the whole can and decided to reduce the water by half i figured the moisture from the pumpkin would replace the water i didnt use this bread was insanely delicious and moist it doesnt last long in my house i am making two loaves tonight for tomorrows potluck thanksgiving lunch at work this is a definite keeper the color of the bread is beautiful too
5,this was just an amazing pumpkin bread recipe i didnt even notice that you were not supposed to use the whole can of pumpkin and it turned out delicious i added a spiced citrus glaze on top along with a few pumpkin seeds and let me tell you that was the best decision of my life
5,excellent pumpkin bread added raisins only was out of walnuts
5,this is the best pumpkin bread recipe ever i followed it to a t except did not use walnuts or raisins as my boyfriend does not like either of those he keeps telling me how delicious it is he even once referred to it as orgasmic i find the flavor and texture absolutely perfect i will make this again and again
5,perfect pumpkin bread use the whole can of pumpkin and skip the water made once with butter instead of canola oil and also once with apple sauce instead of the oil slices freeze well
5,this is my favorite bread to date i doubled the recipe i always made banana nut bread as gifts but tried this with the whole oz can of pumpkin skipped the water added walnuts and raisins of course i had to try it before giving it as gifts my husband and i loved it so much wei hit on the second loaf which left me with only two and then i had to bake four more as gifts yummy
5,great recipe easy to put together very moist
5,great loaf used pumpkin instead of water and used cake flour
5,i enjoyed this bread a lot it came together quickly with regard to mixing and it baked up beautifully i love that it is made with oil no creaming any butter so that makes it easier to mix up i have sometimes added cup of chocolate chips to the recipe with excellent results
5,my favorite pumpkin bread i add cranraisins
5,this bread is quick and has that perfect sweet and spice i look for in the cooler months i used one cup fresh pumpkin instead of canned dropped the oil down to cup and used cup of milk instead of the water super moist and fluffy
5,i love this recipe i made as written many times but the last time i added the entire can of pumpkin tsp cinnamon and tsp pumpkin pie spice i added chopped walnuts and put the mix into smaller disposable loaf pans for sharing it was fantastic great either way but if youre looking to use up your pumpkin without doubling the recipe it will work i think its more moist and has more pumpkin flavor great recipe i tell everyone to use it thanks
5,thid bread is fantastic it is my go to recipe
5,very good i used my squash instead of pumpkin still tastes great
5,tastes great i doubled the recipe and used walnuts and pecans this pumpkin bread is definitely a winner
5,i love pumpkin bread and this recipe is great just the right amount of pumpkin taste i might try and do muffins the next time i usually leave out the nuts and may try the suggestion to add cinnamon chips or butterscotch chips
5,delicious and moist pumpkin bread i did not add the spices because i wanted the full pumpkin flavor and instead of raisins i used craisins and plumped them first i winner in our house
5,i love this recipevery moist and deliciousthis recipe makes awesome cookies toojust drop by teaspoon or tablespoon onto a cookie sheet and bake for mins great for the upcoming holidays

5,awesome i used chocolate chips in place of nuts love it
5,absolutely delicious this is the only recipe i will use from now on when making pumpkin bread i followed the directions exactly as written great taste very moist yum only problem my family gobbled it up so quickly i will have to make another one
5,love this pumpkin bread read throught the reviews and made the following tweaks oj instead of water full can of pumpkin and dried cranberries instead of raisins delicious
5,this is the best pumpkin loaf ever so moist and flavourful a keeper for sure
5,like others i substituted cup applesauce for the cup water i substituted ground ginger for the nutmeg since my family wont eat anything with nutmeg left out the raisins since one son wont eat raisins otherwise followed the recipe exactly whole family raved about it being the best pumpkin bread ever and it disappeared in record time moist from beginning to end and delicious delicious delicious
5,i use golden raisins which i boil in the water called for in the recipe use a little extra for boil off then roll the raisins in flournot too much and fold in to batter they will not be chewy they will be delicious and they will not go to bottom of pan and burn
5,best pumpkin bread i ever had add tbsp extra flour i also added walnuts and pecansyum
5,great recipe i added a little ginger to it now im embarrassed to admit this but i totally forgot about the oil and the bread turned out just fine it tasted amazing i didnt realize i forgot it until i had already eaten some calories saved by this mistake cal grams of fat so i had two loaves which means that if you break it into ths you save grams of fat per serving
5,i thought this was a very good recipe i substituted some sour cream for some of the water and doubled the recipe to use a full can of pumpkin i substituted brown sugar for half of the sugar and reduced the sugar by c i made a large loaf and standard muffinsto those who changed the recipe and then it didnt work out cooking is chemistrychange the formula and you can get unexpected results if you dont compensate dont blame the recipe
5,this recipe is very good i followed as is and it turned out excellent and the smell while its baking is even better for those people that completely change the recipe to suit their taste should not review the recipe it is not a true review of the recipe make it as is then review
5,good easy to prepare
5,i use pecans instead of walnuts but i just have to ask what is a large small bowl that just killed me
5,decided to try this recipe since i had all the ingredients with the exception of the nutmeg the family loved it and its now my go to pumpkin bread recipe i didnt have nutmeg but i did have pumpkin pie spice so i substituted that for the cinnamon and nutmeg also i realized after i put the pan in the oven i forgot to add the salt but after tasting it without the salt i think i will just leave it out in the future too
5,why in the world to all you people review a recipe you make your own changes to it is frustrating to start reading and then realize it is not based on the recipe as written i spend more jumping on to the next one stick to the recipe
5,fabulous the only thing i did differently was to use two loaf pans instead of one and bake for minutes they came out perfectly
5,great receipe but i found with my oven i had to bake it about minutes i baked the bread in a pyrex glass loaf pan added walnuts and raisens delicious
5,has anyone used fresh mashed pumpkins
5,moist deliciousand easy made per recipe except left out the nuts and raisins loved it
5,this is delicious ive made half a dozen loaves in the past month i have a houseful of pumpkin anything fans better than starbucks dont get the bad review something was off maybe the oven mines turned out perfectly every time
5,with of the respondents giving this recipe a star rating i took the plunge and made a double batch without ever trying the recipe out what good is half a can of pumpkin puree right unless you make a smoothie and ive already had my breakfast ive got just over an hour before my first tastingyes this definitely is star pumpkin bread and i think its way better than starbucks versionfyi i omitted raisins and walnuts the next time i make it which will be later today i will add some topping just like starbucks im going to bring some to share for the holiday this week and freeze a couple to have on hand i will add some walnuts to one of the next two loaves i make i used two different bread pans one dark metal and one glass the metal one took longer to bake in the center i set the timer for minutes as i always go under with my oven and the one in glass pan was not ready i gave it an extra minutes which was only minutes more than the recommended baking time
5,im glad i finally found an excellent recipe for pumpkin bread that has some spice to it i saw some cans of pumpkin in my pantry and decided to try this my husband loved it in fact after only one day it is gone i plan to make some of these for my relatives for christmas the only things added were a little brown sugar on top and some additional walnuts yum this recipe is definitely a keeper
5,didnt last a day at my house excellent recipe

5,moist tender and tasty i followed the recipe as it stated except i used amount of sugar it turned out just the way we liked it thanks for sharing
5,i absolutely loved this recipe i surprisingly ran out of oil so i improvised i instead used only cup oil and cup almond milk i reduced the liquids because i also added cup more pumpkin to the loafi have baked this recipe both ways and fell equally this has by far been the best pumpkin bread i have bakednote the best way to keep your bread moist is to turn off the oven when you are a couple minutes from being fully done and letting the pumpkin bread cook slowly for about minutes in the turned off oven make sure to cover snugly once the pan is cool enough to grab or else it will dry out thank you so much for the recipe

5,this is a very good bread i did make a few changes to try to make it healthier i used splenda instead of sugar i used one egg and one serving of egg beaters i used one cup of all purpose flour and cup of whole wheat flour i also halved the oil and added cup of water blended with one whole orange pureed in place of some of the oil also i added one teaspoon of maple extract it turned out moist and very tasty
5,i loved this recipe and so did my family and friends the only adjustments i made was i used the pumpkin that i canned myself and i used pecans instead of walnuts with no raisins everyone asked for a copy of this recipe it is very moist and flavorful

5,my family and i enjoyed this very much i used a round deep dish and tortillas about the same size i prefer drained mashed pintos instead of retried beans i dont care for tomato chunks so i puréed the canned mexican flavored diced tomatoes added a can of diced green chilies as well to the meat mixture my husband felt like it needed more tortillas than the three used for the layers i might try doubling next time i used to make something similar that had fritos in it he wants me to add some next time served with sour cream and guacamole it was yummy
5,this was really easy and quite tasty i did use a few more tortillas three per layer and used lb of turkey and lb of ground beef also no black beans or green pepper on hand so i doubled the refried beans topped with shredded lettuce and sour creamyum
5,this was a big hit in my house everyone loved it i served with sour cream and salsa its a keeper recipe i will definitely make again great flavor thanks for sharing
5,made this for dinner last night and the family loved it i used corn tortillas instead of flour i used sweet yellow and red peppers had on hand i doubled the recipe and so didnt use refried beans since two cans of black beans were in it i also added black olives my mom loves olives will make it again for sure
5,had this tonight and everyone loved it delicious this recipe is a keeper made my own taco seasoning
5,i have made this recipe numerous times i use more ground beef usually amp lbs and more cheese everyone always raves about this dish
5,this recipe is a staple im in texas and we still love it i use plantbased meat substitute but otherwise follow the recipe very tasty and a crowd pleaser
5,this is the best recipe for taco lasagna its easy and a lot less time consuming than other recipes ive made this recipe at least times and it always turns out great you an freeze it after making it or after its been cooked great for pot lucks or taking to someone in need try it you will love it i serve mine with toppings of chopped fresh tomatoes salsa and shredded lettuce
5,very quick and easy used ingredients i always have on hand very tasty i was going to cut the recipe down for so instead of two cans of beans i used refried black beans
5,made this last night only one word describes the casserole delicious the only thing i did was at italian sausage and ground turkey because that is what i had this is a keeper
5,try it with chili beans and use their sauce
5,this recipe is great i prepared it as written i was amazed at how easy the whole dish went together i couldnt find mexican tomatoes so i used diced tomatoes with green chilies my grandson and his friends were having a gathering and they all loved it i did use more cheese like oz packages next time and there will be a next time i think i will cut the tortillas in strips as reviewer did as it was a bit difficult cutting portions
5,i tried this last night and was impressed this recipe is a keeper i omitted the refried beans because my daughter absolutely hates them and left out the green pepper cuz im not a fan also substituted corn tortillas for regular tortillas because my husband is severely allergic to gluten but did the rest as described and we loved it will definitely make this again
5,ive tried a few recipes this one is the best the retried beans made it i didnt change a thing
5,great recipe the first time i made it i followed the recipe excellent made it again but added an additional taco seasoning packet and a can of corn and upped the cheese to cups even better used two inch round pans and had enough left over to make a handful of burritos a definite winner
5,excellent recipe the second time we made it before serving we topped it with a generous amount of chopped lettuce amp diced tomatoes the topped with some sour cream have made several times always a big hit
5,excellent recipe easy enough for kids to help
5,yummy cut the corn tortillas in half and place the cut sides to the edges of the dish and then fill the center with one cut half as others have suggested i also heat the refried beans and mix in with the meat mixture because my dh requires a low sodium diet i use my own taco seasoning recipe salt free canned tomatoes or my own canned tomatoes and add chopped jalepeno pepper this is one of my best potluck recipes
5,very very good my family loved it thank you for sharing this recipe
5,made this tonight and had a tastey dinner i altered just a little by adding more hamburger thus more seasoning however i only had pkt of taco seasoning so i used what i had on hand pkt fajita seasoning it came out good i also added crushed corn chips sliced avacado banana peppers amp cilantro yum i finished it by adding fat free sour cream amp shredded lettuce when served
5,this recipe is so yummy and easy to make absolutely loved it will make this many more times for sure
5,awesome outstanding chopped up some jalapeo and added to half since wife cant handle the heat plan to add nibblet corn next time to try something a little different definitely a new family favorite
5,i used a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles and a can of diced tomatoes
5,why is there always someone that has to comment on sodiumm nutritional value chances are that if a person is making any of these recipes they are an adult im pretty sure that everyone is capable of making their own decision as to whether or not they want to eat something mind your own business people look at these reviews to read about what others thought of the recipe when they made it the nutritional information is posted for everyone to see if that is a concern for them
5,so simple and so delicious i didnt have green peppers so i used tomatoes and green chiles after baking i added sour cream lettuce and taco sauce the next time i make it i will probably add more cheese a little more taco seasoning and corn very good
5,easy recipe quick to prepare my year old loves it i made the following tweaks used fresh diced tomatoes instead of canned added black olives omitted the onion amp served with a dollop of sour cream on top this recipe is now requested a couple of times a month in my house great alternative to the basic taco
5,i have been making this recipe for years now and have shared with many others i follow the recipe as is but use pinto beans instead of black beans also at times i will use mexican chihuahua cheese this is certainly a household favorite in our family
5,excellent love it and so does everybody else
5,we loved thisi doubled the ground beef and added some frozen corn
5,this is super easy to put together and fabulously delicious i found this to be perfectly flavorful especially topped with your favorite toppings like taco sauce salsa salsa verde sour cream chopped fresh cilantro however you like to dress up your tacos i wasnt sure what the recipe meant by mexican diced tomatoes but by the size of the can it calls for i knew it wasnt rotel although it would probably be fine i used red gold petite diced tomatoes with lime juice and cilantro which is located with all the other kinds of canned diced tomatoes and it worked out very well this makes a lot but dont worry it reheats really well
5,fabulous make it just as it its written it needs no changes everyone in my family loves this and its a nice change from tacos
5,so easy to prepare i used lbs of beef absolutely delicious whole family enjoyed it some was even taken to the girlfriends house
5,so easy and so delicious i used corn tortillas and put it under the broiler for minute at the end to make the cheesy tortillas nice and crisp
5,everyone raved about this dish i will make it again soon
5,this was delicious i used shredded chicken and corn tortillas and added jalapenos topped with lettuce tomatoes cilantro avocado jalapenos and sour cream kids loved it too
5,make this so often for potlucks dont always use the black beans
5,this was so easy and delicious i also mixed the refried beans into the meat mixture for easier assembly and it was fantastic everyone loved it i served with lettuce tomato salsa and sour cream for people to add as they wished
5,i have made this a few times the first time i made this my and yr olds looked at it and were hesitant since then they have requested it when we make our weekly menus i also mixed the refried beans with the meat mixture because otherwise the beans are thick and a pain to spread my year old son did of the work the last time i made this and it is not typical that my kids request leftovers the next day but they do for this
5,this is delicious easy to play around with and vary it i never make it the same way twice i always add more cheese than it calls for and put in or minced fresh serrano peppers like others mentioned i usually swap out the flour tortillas for corn it makes enough for the of us each to have a good hearty serving nights in a row this is one of those satisfying comfort foods that really fill you up and put you in that wonderful food coma right after eating
5,great base recipe to easily exchange to make it for your own family
5,my family loves it just the way it is
5,ive been making this recipe for several years now and my husband just loves it we make it as specified in the recipe and think it is amazing
5,this was great i didnt have green peppers so i omitted them but it was still great pretty simple to make too
5,delicious and i like how this recipe can be customized to satisfy your own unique tastes to the meat mixture i added corn chopped green olives and a couple teaspoons of lime juice lots of extra cheese on the layers top it all off with shredded lettuce tomatoes salsa sour cream jalapenos corn chips avocados to name just a few to those who commented that the refried beans are too hard to spread heat the refried beans in the microwave first and the consistency will soften for easier spreading make sure you cover the dish before baking so it doesnt dry out or get too crispy enjoy
5,i made this tonight for dinner and it was awesome my husband said i had better not lose this recipe he absolutely loved it i also added corn and a little extra taco seasoning and more cheesethis will for sure be one of my new go to meals

5,family favorite i have made this with both beef and chicken i also add a half of a can of corn and a half can of diced green chilies i prefer to use organic whole grain white corn tortillas and sometimes i skip the last layer of tortilla altogether as well as one of the cheese layers cutting a layer of tortillas and a third of the cheese does nothing to reduce the taste serve with tossed salad and corn bread so good
5,great easy dinner for the whole family to enjoy

5,so good loved this recipe so did my two girls my month old ate as big of a piece as i did and asked for more i will definitely be making this again update i make this dish on a regular basis still a family favorite however this recipe fills a x casserole dish which is a little too much for us to eat in a couple of days what ive started doing is mixing all of the filling together ground beef onion pepper water taco seasoning black beans and diced tomatoes i also started mixing in the refried beans so its simpler to put together and the taste is the same then i divide the entire recipe in half i use tortillas half the filling and half the cheese and make up a x dish then i take the remaining half of just the filling and freeze it in a freezer container next time i want to make this dish i defrost the filling and then make another x casserole works perfect for my family
5,winner winner we loved our dinner

5,pamela rated it stars because the bars didnt turn out she clearly added things to the recipe and threw it off balance this is such an easy and tasty recipe my family loves them
5,i made these today its wonderful didnt change a thing i added cinnamon because i thought the recipe called for it i love banana cake bars bread this is terrific
5,these are amazing loaded with flavor i did add an extra banana to the batter and a tablespoon of corn syrup and honey to the frosting
5,these are so good and i havent even frosted them yet think i might just dust with a little powdered sugar this time so we can eat them right away like now
5,made this today and both my husband and i thought it is delicious i cut back on the sugar used about cups we dont like cake too sweet i also make a glaze for top cup powdered sugar tablespoons milk teaspoon vanilla plus couple dashes of nutmeg i baked it in a glass x baking dish at for about min glaze was sufficient for that size
5,wow these were the best banana bars ive ever made to begin i used country crock olive oil plant butter i only had cup of white sugar so to substitute i added cup of brown sugar not packed and a scant cup of chocolate chips while still warm i drizzled with my own cardamom glaze made of butter milk powdered sugar vanilla and ground cardamom i am not a fan of cream cheese frosting this was not my first time making these but the above changes elevated this recipe to a whole new level
5,i have made this so many times it is a favorite of ours freezes in cut pieces very well i usually add about c ground walnuts just because we love them
5,these bars are amazing id eat the whole pan myself i use only one cup of sugar and ripe bananas they are sweet without the exra cup plus adding the frosting makes them even sweeter not sure what star pamala did back in feb but ive been making these for years tried and true this recipe is definitely more then stars its quick to maje as well kids and adults will love it

5,oh wow so easy and so tasty i made my first batch for my husbands work the next daywell it didnt make it gotta make another batch this is a recipe i am sharing with my daughters
5,easy and goodwill make again
5,had a lot of over ripe bananas and needed a change from banana bread this is excellent even without the frosting
5,my whole family loves this recipe including my son who may just be the pickiest eater i have ever know my only change was i had to use a x and add minutes i guess with it being smaller the icing gets to be a little thick for my husband who doesnt have much of a sweet tooth but i love it thinking about adding some spices and nuts once just for fun but definitely not necessary for this recipe
5,made these over the weekend and the bars were moist delicious and perfect to have with your morning coffee my husband took several pieces to work and shared a piece with his coworker and now the guy wants the recipe so his wife can make him a platefulthis recipe is definitely a keeper
5,i have made these three times and they are perfect i substituted cup of whole wheat flour and added cup of flaxseed meal i also cut the sugar in half and added cup of honey finally i used reduced fat cream cheese my coworkers wont know the difference
5,this was very easy and made a good quantity of delicious bars i had about smaller sized bananas to use up and this recipe was perfect i threw in a little cinnamon amp candied ginger for added flavor like others i used a x pan glass increased time by minutes and halved the frosting i also used a pineapple cream cheese in the frosting because i happened to have this available amp needed to use it up along with the bananas it proved to be an excellent choice for the frostingthe bars were moist and flavorful definitely a keeper
5,these bars are better than banana bread very moist i add chopped walnuts and the bars go fast whenever i make them
5,i absolutely love this recipe but i think it tastes even better if you replace the flour with banana multi purpose flour by pereg this banana flour is an amazing replacement for all sorts of recipes
5,outstanding i took this to a party having never made it before and it got rave reviews i also baked it in a x pyrex pan and increased the cooking time somewhat based on other reviewer suggestions it came out great i didnt have enough confectioners sugar so i reduced the butter and cream cheese somewhat and added a little milk to help it spread better it still came out delicious
5,wonderful id give it stars if i could having a hard time keeping my hands from snatching a piece every time i walk past the fridge
5,this is my second review and it is still thee best banana bar recipe you can use a x greased pan increase baking time to minutes or until done you only need half of the frosting recipe and it is the perfect amount for the x
5,a friend made this for us really good have a nice taste texture and moist these are great for family and friends also for a social pot luck there wont be any left for the next day

5,these bars are so good i had bananas to use up and my family loved these
5,these are really easy and so delicious i only had a half sheet pan they were thinner than usual but still turned out great highly recommended
5,taste real good but the frosting just a little runny
5,i did have to bake mine about minutes longer than mentioned but sure worth waiting for delicious easy and a keeper thank you for sharing
5,my family really enjoyed this i made it in a x pan because i didnt have the right size so it came out cakey but was fine stored in the fridge tasted better cold to me and made it a bit more dense not as light and cakey

5,every time i make these delicious banana bars they get gobbled up so fast a great way to use use up ripe bananas and have a great desert i always half the amount of frosting because it makes so much
5,i have made this recipe many times just as written everytime my grandson needs a desert for scouts he and often the scouts asks me to make these the frosting makes a lot but the boys seem to think the more the better when i make it for home i will cut it into squares and freeze them on a sheet pan when frozen i can then put them in a container on top of each other and the frosting doesnt stick to the waxed paper
5,this is a great recipe added walnuts to top of frosting and left them off half of the cake and split with a couple of friends although i could have eaten the whole thing will definitely make again
5,i made this yesterday just delicious i used a brown sugar icing instead of cream cheese as i dont care for cream cheese icing it was so good
5,my husband declared these banana bars very good they are also good with vanilla or lemon frosting
5,i cut the sugar for frosting in half delight
5,the best banana bars ever anytime i make these they are always the first thing to disappear even people who say they dont like bananas and bakery made with bananas love them they are so quick and easy to make and it makes a large pan for sharing
5,i was very surprised they were so good and they were easy
5,these were amazing it was such a great way to use my brown bananas instead of making banana bread i will say it didnt feel like a bar to me but more like a shallow banana cake it was a little dry to me but i may have over baked it the frosting was delicious amp the two combined were such a great treat i will make these again for sure amp try to make them a little better on my end such as not over baking great recipe
5,great way to use up those left over bananasthe cream cheese frosting is what takes these to the next level

5,this is buddy valastros recipe with the exception of putting under broiler in my years of cooking since years old i have spent the last years modifying my method to buddys this recipe takes it up a notch because of the broilingbetter for the bread crumbs i significantly increase the number of shrimps usually plus pounds and increase the sauce it is classic shrimp scampi
5,so quick simple amp good restaurant quality taste i used farfalle bow tie pasta amp it was perfect all the nooks amp crannies collected the crumbs amp garlic once the garlic is minced amp the shrimp is cleaned this dish comes together in minutes i made this recipe as is but you could add a veggie or two it would be fabulous
5,delicious easy to prepare flavorful and loved by everyone just as a side note if you are serving this with pasta there is not a lot of liquid so you may want to add some for your pasta i used a splash of olive oil but some white wine or broth might taste good too

5,we thought this was delicious this was my first time using a castiron skillet but it was just so easy the only thing i changed was that i used spaghetti instead of angel hair oh and i also used dried parsley instead of fresh i can understand why the one reviewer said it was dry but i dont really agree there isnt a traditional sauce but the lemon and butter definitely keep this from becoming dry even the leftovers were delicious we will definitely make this again
5,quick easy and so tasty i added a few fresh tomatoes chopped to the skillet with the garlic and it was yummy
5,i have tried several shrimp scampi recipes over the years and this one is definitely the best we added some spinach after to the pasta after draining the water my husband and i agree that this was restaurant quality thanks for sharing

5,this is one of my all time favorites ive made this with both shrimp and with chicken when i have no shrimp in the house i fallow directions the same for both yes the shrimp is better then the chicken but its a nice change of pace for chicken it needs a tad more sauce for both chicken ad shrimp for us but thats easily taken care of

5,this recipe is delicious my husband and two year old twins ate it up plus seconds after reading the comments i increased the amount of sauce by adding about cup white cooking wine and only put about cup of lemon juice i also upped the oregano and pepper to thicken it i added a tablespoon or two of sour cream i cooked the shrimp mixture with frozen shrimp and pasta on the stove and then put everything in a corningware baking dish to broil it with the bread crumbs and cheese on top i personally thought it needed more lemon juice and added it at the table but my kids and husband thought it was perfect without any addons it was soooo easy and i will make it again this will be a weekly staple meal in our house and did i mention that its pretty and good enought to serve to company
5,even my very picky daughter came back for seconds super easy recipe
5,savory has become a favorite with my wife and girls even my picky teenager
5,very simple this was my first time making shrimp and it turned out perfect my family raved over it i served it as a side with a london broil and not with pasta delicious
5,very quick and easyadded small scallops with the shrimpyummy
5,made for new years eve for the family and was a huge hit broiling it was what gave it that special touch will definitely make again
5,agreed that it needed more sauce the nd time i made it i added a bit more olive oil and butter also used cooked small maine shrimp and it was so yummy its on its way to becoming a favorite around my house
5,my family loved this recipe i did add more shrimp than called for because my three yr old loves them
5,loved it family loved it one child doesnt like shrimp but loved the pasta dished out without shrimp usually make pasta with alfredo sauce but this is a much lower calorie choice
5,forgot to add i especially liked the ease of the preparation so good and easy
5,i use this recipe all the time so easy to prepare i also use scallops in place of the shrimp
5,excellent recipe and so easy i used asiago cheese because i didnt have parmisian also used red pepper flakes instead of pepper omitted the bread crumbs after broiling i added the pasta and stirred to coat the pasta delicious
5,made exactly as recipe called they are delicious next time i will use fresh rhubarb and use more the frosting was so creamy my husband thought they were delicious also but would like more of the rhubarb thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe
5,i make these on a regular basis and i follow the directions as is with just a bit more rhubarb
5,these are wonderful just as written or a tad more rhubarb i waited to write my review because i froze some as there is just the two of us and i wanted to see how well they were after freezing well after months in the freezer they were perfect my husband said to be sure to keep this recipe and he doesnt even like rhubarb
5,add tbs cherry grand marnier or in place of the vanilla in the topping and drambuie to the custard for a nice twist
5,i am always looking for a good rhubarb recipe and this one is so delicious i made these bars for friends for a memorial day cookout and they were a hit the tart rhubarb and the sweet topping are a perfect match i pulled them out of the oven and allowed to cool for about hour before serving them warm with the creamy topping my husband ate one cold for breakfast the next morning i will freeze the rest for later
5,these are the best bars ive ever made and tasted so easysuper delicious
5,this recipe was great the only change i made was halving the lemon juice and using chicken broth for the other half so it wouldnt be so lemony i also added fresh basil in addition to the fresh parsley i did broil it which i agree added a nice touch my family is very picky and they all agree this one is a keeper
5,this was absolutely delicious
5,delicious however i also used less lemon juice and added a bit more olive oil next time i will try it with the white wine
5,very good but i agree about the lemon it was too much
5,this was very delicious broiling it in the oven was a great idea
5,this meal was delicious i used white wine instead of lemon juice after reading the reviews it was soooo good yummy and easy
5,this meal is absolutely delicious try using italian style bread crumbsyum yum
5,my family says this is a keeper hubby would have liked a bit more sauce over the pasta but otherwise it was perfect and sooo easy
5,i make this and my dad makes it we just dont put the topping on its a big hit my dad makes one every week to take to local diner and they ask him to bring in more every time
5,delicious i cut the recipe in half and put in a inch square pan i used almost cups of rhubarb and i wish i would have used more the crust is nice and sweet and the custard really goes well with the tart rhubarb i didnt have the ingredients for the topping so i just used whipped cream it was really tasty next time i am going to make the regular topping with the cream cheese and increase the rhubarb to cups for a half size batch yum
5,delicious i made this once just as it is and it got such great reviews from my family that i put it in my recipe box i would suggest a very large x baking dish because it makes a lot i will try cutting it in half the next time a great way to use rhubarb
5,love love love this recipe but the topping makes it too sweet i make with either a meringue or drizzle a glaze on it fabulous recipe
5,i made these exactly as written and they were amazing the recipe definitely makes a lot of them theyre rich so cutting them smaller is fine i took them to two different events this past weekend and they were a huge hit at both im definitely making these again
5,these are fabulous simple to make and so delicious these have become a family favorite and requested often i now buy lots of rhubarb when it is in season and chop and freeze just for this dish
5,absolutely delicious my kids loved them
5,so yummy everyone i shared with asked for the recipe
5,i tried this recipe for the first time but it will definitely not be the last this has become one of my favorite rhubarb recipes its sweet creamy and a touch of tart the recipe is so easy to make i highly recommend trying this recipe
5,so good the shortbread crust is a little labor intensive but worth making my new favotie rhubard recipe
5,very tasty i usually dont like rhubarb
5,can these rhubarb bars be frozen after baking
5,theses were fabulous i picked my rhubarb in the morning i made the recipe more tart version and they were liked by all i agree that people who think they dont like rhubarb would love these so different
5,i love these bars sometimes i add cup of either raspberries or strawberries to the rhubarb to change things up they are delicious either way
5,these are so good ive been making it for years ever since i found it my family loves them when rhubarb season is here they are made if i get really busy i use canned cream cheese frosting
5,nice one
5,i love anything with rhubarb but have to include strawberries i cut down the cups of rhubarb to and added cups of chopped strawberries and used ounces of cream cheese instead of just everyone that has had them say they are beyond awesome
5,i love anything rhubarb and had a lot to use this year i had to bake closer to an hour but the end result was very good will definitely make this again
5,it was easy to make and very tasty i halved the crust and used amp instead of whipping cream and lessened the sugar i always do in desserts and it was very good i also had to bake it close to an hour thanks for sharing
5,my mom first introduced me to these bars years ago and ive since started making them so good ive even turned nonrhubarb eaters onto this bar love that they stay fresh in the fridge for many days
5,these bars surprised me i liked them much more than i thought i would i made them for a support group i go to and i bake each month and i like to try something differenti think the next time i make these and there will be many more next timesi am going to increase the amount of rhubarb i think it can use almost double but i will start with cups and see if it could still use morei did the custard part in my blender much smoother than whisking in a bowl once it was blended smooth i poured it into the same bowl the base has been mixed in then stirred in the rhubarbi did make change to the frosting i used a full package ounces of cream cheese i thought what the heck am i going to do with ounces of cream cheese the frosting was great i do not think the extra ounces mad a difference i did not increase the sugar or the cream and i can not imagine the frosting being any better than it was
5,these were delicious i reduced the rhubarb and added some chopped strawberries because they are a great combination i also used an entire package of cream cheese in the frosting i think it helps it from being too sweet
5,this is definitely a star dessert it is similar to my motherinlaws custard rhubarb pie so maybe thats why we loved it so much
5,easy to make it was delicious
5,i would recommend this recipe as one of the best rhubarb bars
5,oh so good
5,these bars are winners i substituted cool whip for the whipping creamstill great
5,very tasty but the crust was really rich when i make it again i would make it with a thinner crust base
5,when i read this recipe i read the tips at the end and said to myself i have rosewater im totally doing that but then when i was creating the filling i forgot so i added it to the topping omg so good i had trouble getting it looking like pretty bars maybe i need to make it again i totally reccomend adding the rose water
5,this deserves stars
5,i didnt think i liked rhubarb until i tried this recipe yum
5,absolute favorite in our home made this many times
5,this is the best soup ever
5,wow great taste too many ingredients but totally worth it
5,this soup is wonderful my family loves it
5,i took this to work and it disappeared fast
5,this soup should be called potato cheeseburger soup because there are so many potatoes they are very good though its true that kids love this soup mine did and asked for it all week fortunately i made a double batch i think the velveeta made it kid friendly this recipe is a keeper in our house
5,fantastic and gets better each time you reheat it
5,i will definitely make this soup again very tasty and filling i used mexican blend cheese instead of velveeta made a big pot on a cold day and gave some to my neighbors we all loved it definitely a keeper
5,i have made this recipe many times since it first appeared in taste of home everyone absolutely loves it even a very picky eater loved it definitely a keeper
5,i have made this over and over now its one of my familys favorites my daughter now keeps the beginnings of it in her freezer so she can throw it together quickly when she gets home from work
5,fantastic i made the very same version of this soup only without the sour cream before i hadnt thought to add that in but it really made a wonderful difference in the taste so glad i came across this recipe
5,i have never written a review before so that goes to show you what a big hit this soup is in my home my young boys love it and its one i make for guests as well thanks for the great recipe
5,my family loves this recipe i get asked for the recipe where ever i bring this dessert i use the whole oz package of cream cheese and cool whip instead of whipped cream
5,cool one
5,absolutely delicious rave reviews from everyone
5,these are so good they have moved into the favorite category i dont change anything
5,whoever came up with this recipe is an absolute genius they are very rich otherwise they would all be gone in no time at our house
5,i made this yesterday for dessert at a pot luck dinner of people everyone loved it and commented that it was very satisfying and not too sweet
5,this was amazing made it for easter today and loved it i cut down on sugar for both the custard filling and the topping and its perfect will definitely make this again
5,i love the filling of this recipe instead of the cream cheese frosting i make a meringue topping delish
5,these are absolutely wonderful however i dont call them bars i served them as a dessert on a plate with a fork too tall and soft to eat with your fingers although they are finger licking delicious rich yes yummy you bet
5,i have been saving this recipe to try for years and was so happy when i saw rhubarb at the farmers market last week these were delicious and i will be making them again
5,best rhubarb recipe i ever tried
5,i made these today without changing a thingsimply decadent
5,amazing recipe my husband and i visit this small amishmennonite restaurant and i always get their rhubarb custard pie this reminds me of that pie but so much easier to make to cut back on calories i omitted the frosting and just drizzled a very thin vanilla frosting over the top and i was happy with the result this will be my go to recipe from now on replacing the rhubarb custard pie i usually make thanks for sharing this
5,my favorite rhubarb recipe family and friends love it
5,love these bars fantastic used cups of rhubarb
5,great bars i also use sliced canned or fresh peaches and sprinkle chopped nuts on top i dont frost mine
5,fabulous dessert for a recent dinner party i added nutmeg to the shortbread crust and as others suggested cups of rhubarb yes it makes a lot and if i were preparing it for a smaller amount of folks i would halve the recipe
5,delicious the shortbread crust is easy to make the filling moist and the rhubarb adds just the right amount of tanginess i will definitely make this recipe again perhaps even using different kinds of fruit instead of rhubarb
5,i made this recipe and took it to work everyone loved it this is a keeper
5,i made these today for my birthday treat i thought they were great the whole family gave them stars they were worth the little extra time it took to make them
5,these are very rich but very tasty im not a fan of the cream cheese so i leave the cream cheese out and top with the sweetened whip cream with a touch of vanilla i leave out a little of the sugar from the topping
5,these bars are awesome the rhubarb taste is lovely i did cut back on the amount of sugar in the filling but just because i like it a little more tart i am going to try cutting back about on the base ingredients just so it is not quite so thick thank you for a great recipe we will be enjoying these often
5,these were absolutely delish i love strawberry rhubarb pie so i cut the rhubarb to cups and added cups of strawberries i used fresh rhubarb and fresh strawberries i think frozen would have added too much moisture there is a lot of sugar but it was worth it next time ill use whipped cream and lose the extra cup of sugar also bars from a x baking dish makes them more like cubes if you are counting carbs bar is more like carbs
5,im so used to boiling rhubarb i didnt read the recipe first mine had rhubarb disributed evenly through them and they tasted very good too i wonboil them next time i make this
5,this is the first review i have submitted these bars are the best rhubarb dessert i have had i will continue to make these i did not change anything in this recipe
5,im pretty sure these bars changed my life
5,i had been wanting to make these bars for some time and im so glad i finally tried them they are outstanding i cut the recipe in half for the two of us and baked them in an xinch pan i also added a sprinkling of nutmeg my grandma always did that with her rhubarb desserts i can see why this is a top ten rhubarb recipe and dessert recipe i will definitely be making these delicious bars again
5,my family loved these bars i wish i would have halved the recipe and cooked in a x or x pan these bars are very rich
5,these were very good i agree with some of the other reviews that there is too much crust and i would make more of the filling i liked them better without the frosting but that is my personal preference not because the frosting wasnt good
5,i first tasted this at a potluck dinner it is wonderful
5,fabulous my family asks for this rhubarb is the key ingredient here i mix the sugar amp flour amp rhubarb more like cups chopped very fine and let it set while i prepare the other parts when making the cookie bottom i dont press it down real tight for sure dont overbake the bottom its better to eat it like fall apart cake than to have it overcooked amp dry ask me how i know smile also bake it in glass not metal i love jaslyns suggestions amp i plan to try them but this recipe is great as is it tastes great warm out of the oven and cold the next day oh and it makes a lot it could easily be halved and one more thing i have been making these bars since the recipe was first published in the magazines in i just never added a rating taste of home fan here
5,yummy first batch went so fast i had to make another immediately both times i just realized i failed to bake the crust and it obviously turned out great anyway the nd time i wanted more custardy filling so added cup milk too we had a housefull of people so it makes enough i will be bringing this to potlucks for sure it certainly was not bland we used freshly picked rhubarb we all loved the shortbread crust i feel this was an easy recipe and quick but then i had my rhubarb already cut and didnt bake the crust before adding the filling it tastes more custardy when eaten warm it sets up a bit when chilled it would be yummy even without the topping i am sure a big hit here
5,best rhubarb dessert ever we are not really rhubarb fans but in honor of my grandfathers rhubarb plant which each of his grandchildren keep growing in our yards been around for a good years now i try to make something every year well this year i have made this recipe six times already it is absolutely delicious the shortbread crust and subtle custard filling are sublime if you love rhubarb this will be your favorite recipe and if you dont it still might be your favorite dessert recipe
5,so so delicious my year old says its her favorite dessert ever she loves it more than birthday cake even
5,these bars are one of the best things ive ever tasted ive switched up the fruit too equally delicious
5,very good but for a crowd
5,these bars are dangerous
5,my new favorite rhubarb recipe
5,wonderful recipe even those who dont like rhubarb like this dessert
5,this is a great recipe nice and creamy the rhubarb is very mellow and the topping is not too sweet this will go into my keeper recipes i made the recipe exactly as is and didnt make any changes
5,these were wonderful i did add more sugar to both the crust and filling but didnt frost the bars
5,love it i made it as shown and everyone loved it but wanted a little more of the rhubarb i will use cups rhubarb next time
5,delicious great old fashioned dessert that my grandkids really enjoyed
5,i made these for a memorial day get together everyone loved these bars but i used ounces of cream cheese
5,made this for a graduation party and everyone loved it instead of cups of rhubarb i used cups of rhubarb and cups of chopped strawberries i only used about cup of sugar to the topping and both pkgs of cream cheese the not so sweet topping offset the sweet center plan to use this with straight strawberries then blackcaps and follow it up in late summer with peachesi think they will all be awesome new keeper recipe
5,this is the best rhubarb recipe i have ever made love it
5,i have always loved the rhubarb torte my mom always makes but not a fan of meringue in which i took off this recipe tastes just like her torte except for a light fluffy cream cheese frosting my new favorite
5,wonderful and lots of rhubarb
5,very good i followed the recipe as written the crust could have baked about minutes longer but that may have been my oven i took this to a potluck without having made the recipe before thats always a gamble i received numerous compliments and a few requests for the recipe telltale vote was in the fact that i took home an empty pan the bars were sweet but the tartness of the rhubarb balances it out and dessert was light tasting i also appreciated that real whipped cream and not artificial topping was used it gave the bars a richer taste than the artificial plastic tasting topping would
5,made these tonight very good when i was at the store getting stuff for this i did not read it carefully when it came to the cream cheese i grabbed two oz pkgs but i did notice it before i made the frosting just used one oz pkg turned out great i was too eager to frost and eat the bars so the frosting got a little warm and melty but after putting it in the fridge everything turned out great easy recipe and very delicious also the crust was good did not think it was too thick
5,i made this for a family reunion and it went over very well recipe is definitely a keeper
5,these are great everyone loved them
5,i havent made this yet but i love rhubarb so will be making it soon and im pretty sure it will rate stars
5,made these with strawberries and rhubarb and they came out great can they be made with any other fruits rhubarb is not available long enough and i dont have a freezer
5,loved these next time i will try to have the rhubarb chopped ahead of time otherwise they were a fairly quick to make desert i did add walnuts but otherwise followed the recipe they were a big hit
5,so easy and absolutely delicious
5,pthe bestp
5,these are awesome i have made these for several years and i always get complimented on them and asked for the recipe
5,everyone who has eaten these bars just loves them even if they are not fans of rhubarb very good
5,the best rhubarb recipe you will ever taste
5,i mixed rhubarb and fresh blueberries together and added alittle cinnamon to the custard yum is all i can say i have made them with just rhubarb for years
5,ive made this recipe a few times and got rave reviews i get requests for this all the time
5,outstanding i used frozen rhubarb that i had thoroughly squeezed out it came out so great that i dont think id want to take a chance using raw rhubarbwould it set as well would it release too much liquidim already thinking of other things to sub incan you imagine this with plump rumsoaked raisins oh my goodnessi wouldnt change anything else about this recipe its simply perfect and it comes together very easily
5,i have been making this every year when the rhubarb is readythis is the only rhubarb recipe i make it never disappoints even the finickiest rhubarb eaters love iti should say that i still have the original recipe from the toh magazine thats a long time to make over and overtry it you wont be dissapointed
5,oh this is very similar to my favorite pie recipe for rhubarb rhubarb custard pie only that recipe has some nutmeg in it i think im going to give this a try since it only gets rave reviews too
5,absolutely amazing i begged for the recipe last year after having one at the horse show food stand
5,i wasnt paying attention and did not have any heavy cream and thought the cream was suppose to be in the bars i used vanilla greek yogurt in the filling and about ounces of cool whip in the frosting these bars turned out excellent
5,my first rhubarb dessert for this season the crust and the filling were wonderful the topping was good but there was way too much of it i only put half of it on and it was still over powering one package of cream cheese would have been plenty family suggested we just use cool whip next time so we could taste the rhubarb i will make again thanks for the recipe
5,this was great at our mothers day bbq it got rave reviews from everyone
5,a new favorite expect for the topping i used ounces of cream cheese powder sugar tsp vanilla beaten together and then ounce cool whip folded in yummo
5,i make these every spring soooo good
5,i took this divine dessert to work this weekthe girls loved it and wanted the recipethey didnt even want to share with other departments the pan emptied fast
5,these bars were really good the crust is very tasty its also good without the topping i added tbs strawberry gelatin to the filling mixing in with the sugar amp flour
5,this is such a delicious recipe for rhubarb ymmy one of my favorite spring time recipes

5,these are the best rhubarb bars
5,i found this recipe awhile back now it is a must to make a few times during the growing season my family loves this it is nice change from the regular recipes i have found
5,i love this recipe and i make it every spring as soon as my rhubarb is ready to be picked i added cups of fresh sliced strawberries and an extra tablespoon of flour to the filling
5,these bars are delicious next time i make this i wont add the full cup of cream to the topping as i found it softer than what i would like
5,these are to die for i sometimes use cool whip for the frosting instead of heavy cream in hopes of cutting calories i dare not make them too often since i cant stop eating them heavenly
5,definately a keeper not to sweet just perfect the texture was nice my frosting was way runnier than what is pictured i will decrease the whipping cream next time
5,i absolutely loved this recipie
5,i make these bars every year when my rhubarb is ready i am never disappointed
5,again and again and again
5,made this for a potluck and it was a hit definitely will make it again yum
5,i find this recipe my new go to everyone loves it if you read the reviews saying it was a runny messdont be alarmed my first one was too there is nothing wrong with the pie if you get a runny mess try again because you didnt cook it long enough that being said even though my first one was a runny mess i was still asked to make it again ive had luck adding mins to the cook time give or take it should still move in the middle slightly but it shouldnt be too jiggly its tough to tell with this one when its done when you get it right its amazing
5,i made this for thanksgiving and it was a huge hit its not overly sweet like a pecan pie sometimes is i used hersheys caramel topping it wasnt fat free otherwise followed directions with the exception of time i read another review that said to bake longer and i did about minutes it was awesome its neat how the syrup moves to the bottom under the cheesecake i love that magic anyway super easy with limited ingredients and great taste just add a little more time like the other review said jiggly on top in the middle should be fine
5,need to bake longer watch until golden brown and set too good
5,i have made this many times but i cook it on my smoker it will cause a fight over the last piece
5,have made these for years but in a jelly roll pan they get thinner amp its become of our top rhubarb favorites everyone always asks for the recipe

5,i think i will use a reduced sodium velveeta next time i make this soup i have an older version of this recipe that does not include potatoes parsley nor flour but cups of cooked rice instead even though the rice was ok i will make this recipe again but instead of the rice ill use the potatoes im looking forward to posting about this version
5,my sister and i made it and loved it totally going to make it again but put some chili powder in it
5,just made this for dinner tonight great recipe definitely will make again added garlic to the recipe and it was definitely a great addition cant wait to have leftovers tomorrow for lunch
5,i used lb of ground beef and american processed cheese slices instead and it worked out great since my family enjoys more beef in their soup i have been making this recipe since it came out in the magazine many years ago love it and share it with many people its always a favorite that is requested at our lenten dinners at church each year
5,i used lb of ground beef and american processed cheese slices instead and it worked out great since my family enjoys more beef in their soup i have been making this recipe since it came out in the magazine many years ago love it and share it with many people its always a favorite that is requested at our lenten dinners at church each year
5,this is so good i did pound ground beef didnt measure the veggies or seasonings just did as much as i liked added more seasonings left out the salt and i used process cheese slicesmaybe use a little less cheese slices next time and i didnt add the sour cream so yummy
5,i followed the recipe as is and it was greatmy parents had even dropped in and sampled the soup and passed the recipe on to them and they are hard to impress food wisethanks so much for this recipe it will be a family favorite for years to come
5,fantastic this was added to my familys top list
5,wow such a great soup the husband and very picky teens loved it will make this again so worth the time
5,it needs something to make it a little zippy next time i may add some peppers and mustard
5,great recipe cut the potatoes in small pieces i cut mine in large chunks and that messed up the texture that was my fault and i will correct it in the future other than that dont change a thing
5,i must admit the first time that i saw this recipe i thought no way but tried it anyway my husband amp i have had this twice already it is so tasty amp not at all as heavy as i thought it would be i would definitely recommend this soup
5,i have made this several times and we love it it have become one of our grandchildrens favorites
5,ive made this soup twicefirst for just my husband and i and the next time for company absolutely wonderful everyone loved iti followed the recipe exactly
5,easy to make and so good the first pie to disappear at thanksgiving this year everyone loved it
5,i made this today to share with some friends and everyone loved it the only change i made was that i substituted homemade brown sugar caramel for the store bought topping its the easy caramel sauce on the pioneer woman site and it literally only takes five minutes to make just make sure to let it come to room temperature before letting it touch the eggs and keep it a little on the runny side it will thicken a bit as it comes to room temperature and you dont want it too thick when you mix it with the eggs the pie was great a perfect blend of several wonderful tastes and textures i give it five stars
5,this recipe is great the pie smells as delicious as it tastes i will definitely be making this one again i put it in a graham cracker crust and it was off the wall i do however have a couple tips to the people who claim the pie was too runny or eggy when mixing the cheese filling make sure you beat it smooth as the instructions say it may take quite a bit of doing considering you are dealing with cream cheese especially if it isnt softened completely make sure there are no chunks left and that it is nice and whipped the same goes for the caramel topping i also only used and a half eggs instead of in the topping mixture let the pecans swim but dont drown them i didnt completely use the entire topping mixture on mine finally make sure your cheesecake is completely baked to the middle and make sure you cool and refridge the pie for the proper amount of time
5,this is a favorite when i take it to church dinners i make it for friends on their birthdays instead of cake
5,delicious pie i dont really care for the standard pecan pie but i really enjoyed this as did my family and guests i followed the recipe and no problems of any kind used graham cracker crust to save time excellent
5,excellent to the other reader that mentioned about the caramel layer on bottom when a cream cheese went down first mine ended up with a caramel layer on the bottom so it must separate itself it turned out looking exactly like the photo and tasted as good as it looked
5,i was very intimidated it was my first time making something from scratch i made it on thanksgiving my whole family loved it and they were very disappointed on christmas when i made something else it really is a hit and its so easy to make and i bought all the ingredients to make it again
5,very easy to make looks like the picture will make again

5,very delicious and was a huge hit with the family
5,everyone in my family absolutely loves this pie and they request it every year the first time i made it i used the wrong kind of caramel so the layers didnt work but it was still good just make sure to double check your caramel before using it super tasty
5,quick easy delicious puzzling how the caramelegg mixture sinks to the bottom during the baking it was the hit of my thanksgiving feast
5,very easy recipe the taste was excellent made it for friends and they loved it i didnt use a deep dish pie crust i used a graham cracker pie crust because its my fav with cheesecake and pecan pie because i didnt use a deep dish pie crust i used less caramel than the recipe called for maybe of it was used my pie still came out like the pic and maybe even better the one problem i did have with the recipe is the timing to leave the pie in the oven the recipe stated mins but my pie was still not done in the middle so i left it for an additional mins or so and it came out perfect with the golden brown crust yummy
5,i have made this times since finding the recipe a little before thanksgiving for the time invested it is delicious tastes like you spent forever in it yummy

5,i liked this pie but i could not figure out what is between the crust and cream cheese it is not in the recipe i rate it a star
5,weve received some inquires about the darker layer above the crust and if an ingredient was missing from the recipe the recipe is correct as published the darker layer is the caramel if the correct caramel product is used it will sink to the bottom during bakingtaste of home test kitchen
5,my son has to live on a gluten free diet so i leave the crust offso he can eat it

5,this is excellent for the past two xmas it is requested
5,this is by far the best and easiest pie to make my whole family loves ittry freezing it for an hour and it is better as a frozen desert
5,would give this stars if i could have made this times and both were gone asap i to was wondering about the layers but decided to go with it sure glad i did just followed directions looked just like the photo its definitely a keeper well worth all the calories
5,it is super easy and so good at first i was nervous too because of the layers but after refrigeration it is perfect
5,this recipe is a keeper everyone that tried it said i could make this for every gettogether we have i have used the lower fat cream cheese and it was just as good
5,i made this pie for our family reunion last week it went like crazy my sons girlfriend asked me to make one just for her the minute we got home i have had so many requests for this recipe since then this pie will definitely be on the thanksgiving menu
5,excellent super easy and delicious my husband loved this recipe i will definitely make this again
5,this is my one of my favorite soups i usually double the recipe when i fix it i serve this at least times during the winter months kids of all ages love it
5,very quick and easy recipe i had to change up some of the recipe but was still fantastic i substituted a few items for things i already had at home beef broth instead of chicken broth i used real mayo instead of sour cream and i diced baby carrots instead of grating them
5,this is a favorite at our church functions have made it many times absolutely love it
5,i love this soup i first made this last year for a soup pot luck and mine was the one all gone at the end several people wanted the receipe i make this all the time in the winter kids love this soup too i omit the celery cause i hate celery by shredding the carrots you dont even know they are in there by the time its all cooked great way sneaking healthy foods in
5,this soup has great flavor i didnt even add any of my own seasonings to it which is something that i almost always do i thought it seemed a little thick so i added about cups of water when boiling the veggies and potatoes and then i also didnt include the sour cream great recipe
5,this soup is amazing i used half and half instead of milk omitted the sour cream and the celery it was perfect and i am making it again this minute
5,very good i used lb ground beef med onion chopped large carrot shredded and the tops out of celery sticks including the leaves chopped
5,ive been making this recipe for years its a family favorite especially during those chilly fall and winter months the only change i make is that i use a full pound of ground beef this hearty soup along with some dinner rolls or other bread and you have a wonderful meal
5,awesome taste i used leftover taco meat from the night before and added cup of mixed veggies because i only had one baking potato to use
5,my husband does not like soup very much but he loves this recipe
5,this dish is absolutely delicious i didnt change a thing about it and i received more compliments from this recipe than anything ive ever made i made a batch and took it work where they were just about licking their bowls
5,love this soup it is my kids favorite i even had to write it down for my son when he got married
5,i have been making this for years this my husbands favorite
5,excellent soup i use instant potato flakes to thicken it
5,i am not a soup person and i love this soup i cant wait to have it the next day for lunch it is really good fresh and left over i do use a full pound of ground beef and try to use healthier ingredients such as velveeta lowsodium chicken broth and fatfree milk it is delicious and the extra sodiumfat is not missed
5,these were delicious the sauce was creamy and smooth they are a bit time consuming i definitely wouldnt make them on a work day we had friends coming over and they were perfect for entertaining i had the enchiladas put together and when our guests arrived i just popped them in the oven they got rave reviews from everyone i served them with chips and salsa and a southwest salad yum
5,i dont give stars very often but my husband and i really did like this a lot my teenage boys thought it was fine but they dont like mexican food that much i used bonafide organic bone broth that you buy in the freezer section traditional beef and chicken broth that you buy on the shelf is not good for you at all and has way too much salt i also didnt add the salt in the recipe as other reviewers suggested the salt flavor was perfect my husband also bought the huge tortillas so i still had to cut them off because it was too much tortilla i used tortillas but they i cut about off of them i put in a little over cup meat in each of them and also used a lot more cheese in the recipe and on top we loved the jalapeños and red onion on the top i wish i put avocado on top too the flavor was great there was a ton of sauce and we love sauce great meal
5,very good hubby liked it a lot i agree that adding rice or beans to the meat would be a good option i used half the amount of salt and the minimum amount of chili powder as per others ratings depends on how hot you want it some said it was mushy so i didnt cook it as long
5,i have been making this recipe since i first made it in i love the sage in it i feel it sets it apart if you are worried about the salt use a salt free broth walmart sells one i alternate corn and flour tortillas every other one i feel if they are all corn they are too mushy and all flour to gummy every other is just right this is hands down a recipe that people ask me for over and over again
5,im not a great cook and this was easy fun and delicious i could have drank the sauce with a straw i took it to work and let people sample it and ended up giving the recipe out multiple times
5,wow this is an awesome pie i made it for a church pie contest and won first everyone thought it was amazing and would never believe that it was so quick and easy thanks for an awesome recipe this is definitely a keeper
5,re caramelpecan cheesecake piethis recipe was easy to make the combination of flavors was wonderful thanks for the recipewendy
5,i made two of these this past weekend and everyone loved them i used smuckers caramel topping in the oz jar not the sundae syrup in the pourable bottle the oz jar is approximately one cup of caramel
5,i read all the reviews and wondered the same thing about the picture vs directions didnt make sense i made this for fathers day and it looked like the picture and it was sooo good i dont know what others did wrong i baked it longer than noted and i used reduced fat cream cheese
5,since many comments have been posted about this pie the test kitchen determined we needed to retest it again for clarification it worked just fine for us however two things are important use a regular in pie plate not a foil pan as they are smaller use the smuckers fatfree caramel topping other smuckers products or other brands may not produce the same resultstaste of home test kitchen
5,i have the cookbook that this recipe is in from we love this recipe i have substituted a few things cheddar cheese for the velvetta if you do substitute add more salt i think it needs a bit more salt even with velvetta and i cut up red potatoes and leave the skin on and make it so often i dont even measure anymore but always a hit i love the leftovers for my lunch the next few days so good with some biscuits
5,loved this it is not a soup you can through together after work but it doesnt taste like that either tastes like grandma would have made loved it
5,this is one of our favorite soups thanks you for this great recipe we make this at least times a month
5,love this soup hearty and deliciousi did tweak it a little cups beef extra c broth c gourmet blend of shredded cheese instead of velveeta c extra sour creami basically increased the size of the recipe and used shredded cheese instead of velveeta yummy my kids love it
5,i made this recipe for our family of three and we ate it two nights in a row thats how much we all loved it i didnt add the sour cream so it came out very cheesy which was perfect for us
5,this is an awesome recipe have made it many times i also have the cookbook that it first came out in i usually double the recipe so i can have leftovers have used frozen hash browns when im in a hurry
5,i have made this recipe for over ten years and everyone always asks for the recipe i also got the recipe from the cookbook
5,amazing i never liked potato soup until this it always seemed bland beforebut this recipe is flavorful and yummy i did add a little red pepper flakes because we like everything spicy i also added a can of mushrooms because my husband like sauted onions and mushrooms on a burger
5,take a little of time to get the ingredients ready but it is well worth the time it is a very yummy and filling soup my husband gives it a thumps up and wants me to make it again
5,i made this soup last night after reading all the wonderful reviews taking a few suggestions from others i added minced garlic instant potatoes one envelope of liptons onion soup and bacon bits oh so yummy
5,made this for dinner last night best soup ever my family loved it and cant wait for me to make it again
5,fantastic flavor chowder consistencymy husband and i loved it and will make it again
5,great recipe i used lbs of ground beef and added in can of rotel diced tomatoes with chilies and package of taco seasoning to give it a little more kick i was short on time so instead of making the homemade sauce i used large can of red enchilada sauce
5,delicious i didnt know homemade enchiladas sauce was so easy to make ill never use the canned one again if i can help it i used cup of flour instead of cup for the sauce
5,i have been making these for years we live out of the usa and storebought sauce is not available i was glad for the sauce recipe the people in the country i live love garlic to them the more garlic the better the taste in any main dish i reduce the amount of flour to the consistency that i like as for the taco mix and taco itself i make my own soft tacos from a recipe as that is the best we can do here my soft taco is rolled very thin and panfried before i fill them thank you for the recipe it has been a family favorite for years
5,ive been making this since it very first appeared in taste of home back in ive memorized the recipe all my children have grown up on this and it has become a main staple in our home over the years i love it because it comes from scratch and doesnt use a canned enchilada sauce everything is absolutely the freshest it can be whoever made up the recipe thank you so much
5,ive been making these ever since the recipe was published and my friends and family love it i triple the recipe and use ground round or ground chuck instead of hamburger i freeze cups of sauce in a freezer bag and cups meat in another freezer bag tripling the recipe makes enough for meals i use this recipe when a friend or family member is sick and needs a meal everyone asks for the recipe the only change ive a made is an omission i dont add salt because theres already salt in the broth and tomatoes i also lean towards the lesser amount of chili powder because i have two daughters who dont like spicy food i love this recipe because it doesnt have any beans making it very kidfriendly
5,a family favorite
5,its so good but even better with home canned broth less salt and homegrown tomatoes stewed and canned
5,we really enjoy these weve made with chicken as well as beef we have also made a pan and frozen them to bake when we needed however we will also bake and then freeze in individual containers vac pack for individual frozen meals when were in a hurry
5,ive been making this for years ever since i found it in my taste of home cookbook over the years ive tweaked a bit for example we love garlic so i use fresh garlic in the sauce as well as the meat mixture i use rotel milder tomatoes instead of plain stewed tomatoes sometimes i add rice to the meative even added sweet corn amp black beans a few times i left out the sage for years just because i never cooked with it but i started to add it about years ago amp it does make a difference all around a great recipe thats easy to modify for your own personal tastes
5,this is a great recipe for enchiladas the flour tortillas are good but we still use corn ones the sauce is great and garlicy you can lower the sage according to your taste we like more cumin and less sage but the recipe is delicious any way you make it you can add cilantro and onion to the beef before you wrap em so so good
5,very very good it was my first attempt and i had to substitute a few ingredients based on what was available and it still turned out amazing i upped the ingredients i really like onion cheese had to make due when i couldnt figure out where the hell my chili powder went and why i have so much chinese spice powder no i didnt add chinese spice powder to the enchiladas
5,this has been my goto enchilada recipe ever since i found it in toh many years ago my whole family loves them
5,i add diced chipotle chile tbsp chipotle sauce while cooking beef for flavor delicious
5,this is a great recipe as is and easy to modify to suit your needs i make this glutenfree with corn starch instead of flour i use a can of rotel in the meat instead of stewed tomatoes and white corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas i have made this again and again my whole family loves it
5,i made this for adults and children under age i made it because i love garlic and then started to worry as i tasted the sauce that the kick would be too much for all the young kids i was so wrong the kids couldnt get enough of it i made and batches and it made very full enchiladas there were left for todays lunch and it tasted even better as leftovers for the sauce i lessened the flour slightly by t for batches and it was still a little too thick for me other than that i followed the recipe exactly everyone was begging for this meal again soon as they were eating it last night
5,this is my first enchiladas that i made and im glad its came out great even i misread the last two directions i didnt put cheese in the tortilla and i put all the cheese on the tortillas before the first bake my husband was raving it and he even brought the leftovers for work i lessened the amount of flour as what the other reviewers said i also lessened the amount of chili because my husband is not fan of spicy and for my year old son this is a keeper and next time ill read the directions very carefully
5,i made these enchiladas for my husband and sons and they really enjoyed them i added cup chopped jalapenos from my garden to the beef mixture since my husband loves hot peppers this recipe was a big hit
5,my husband and i thought these enchiladas were amazing this was my first time making the sauce from scratch it was easy and great tasting we are garlic lovers and the garlic shines in this dish not over powering but it has the spotlight next to the sauce only thing i changed is the meat my husband does not like ground beef so i used ground lamb its much more tender and with the spices you cant taste the lamb witch is good for me
5,i fixed these for a mexican themed meal and they received rave reviews theyre my sons favorite enchiladas
5,this was a fantastic recipe i used ground turkey but otherwise followed the recipe i love that it doesnt use canned enchilada sauce
5,this were delicious the enchilada sauce was super easy to make and cheaper to make than it is to buy the sauce at the store i will be making the sauce for my own enchiladas but using jalapenos for the heat instead of garlic my family loves it spicy
5,this is one recipe that i will not make any changes to i plan on making it today my husband loved it
5,this is a delicious dish i do however agree that it is time consuming and makes a lot of dirty dishes working hours a day i think this will have to be a day off preparation i followed the recipe as follows using the spices that officer tablespoons full and it wasnt too salty or bland very good
5,absolutely love it my family loved it it was a hit i followed everything step by stepdelicious thank you for this recipe definitely a keeper
5,fantastic sauce i will never by store brand again my family preferrs pulled beef or chicken as a swop for the ground beef added a few additional spices and a jalepeno to the mix even as is this is a keeper
5,absolutely excellent everyone even my picky eater loved it my only complaint is that it was way too salty and i did not even add all the salt called for and i also used low sodium beef broth so my suggestion is to completely omit the salt i also think this would be great with shredded chicken or beef and with other things added to the filling like rice beans or pickled jalapenos i had enough filling for of the inch tacos i bet you could also use corn tortillas instead of flour if you wish over all this was amazing and i will definitely make it again i bet this would freeze well if you freeze it before cooking
5,wonderful company dish
5,delicious i also forgot the salt and i am a salt addict as well as the flour and it came out wonderful i too will not be buying the store brands of the enchilada sauce any more
5,this is my go to recipe for beef enchiladas great everytime
5,great
5,as good as everyone says i put the minimum amount of seasoning it called for and it had tons of flavor i will definitely make it again
5,doubled this and it turned out great didnt add the salt as the canned tomato has enough in it for us
5,very easy and yummy
5,my family absolutely loved this even my youngest daughter who declares that she does not like soup thanks for posting and sharing
5,wow very good but i put less butter and cheese another way it will be very buttery and cheesy love it
5,i have made this often saw an episode of diners drive ins and dives where a restaurant served something almost exactly the same they put some fresh chopped iceburg lettuce and fresh chopped tomatoes in the bottom of the bowl before putting the soup in sounds weird huh know what its amazing try it oh and top the soup with some croutons so good
5,myself mother and extended family makes this soup we all love it i use kraft singles and add cooked bacon
5,one of the best hearty soup recipes ever great when the weather turns cool we serve it with my moms homemade buttermilk biscuits and everyone loves it
5,cooked again it is very tasty like usually
5,absolutely delicious this is my familys new favorite soup i didnt have celery either and it was still so tasty i added tsp oregano and tsp thyme for extra flavor
5,sooo good i used more cheese and onion and meat everyone loved it
5,easy to fix and absolutely delicious will definitely make this again
5,this soup is wonderful i did use ground turkey instead of ground beef i also did not add salt because there was a lot of salt in the cubes that i used for the chicken broth i love it
5,this soup was awesome my family loved it great flavor and very filling
5,just made it for the second time and its absolutely great i didnt use as much cheese but i followed the recipe the rest of the way an excellant soup
5,i have made this soup for the family and for church events everyone loves it from kids to the elderly
5,delicious especially on a cold day sitting around watching football big hit with my kids its a keeper definately would make again
5,these are absolutely delectable i warmed the flour tortillas on a comal prior to filling them seemed to keep the tortillas from getting pasty very good
5,these sound terrific but we do not like sage what spice could i use in place of it
5,havent made the enchiladas yet have it in my cookn file amp cant wait to try it next week but used the sauce in the chimichangas i made last night it added a great taste to them the reviews about how good the sauce is are accurate i typed the sauce recipe up separately amp will be using it for mexican cuisine
5,fun and easy recipe great flavor
5,i think the tortillas i used were a tad bigger than recommended they barely fit into my dish but they sure were good and tasty
5,these were delicious
5,excellent i followed the recipe as given but used the smaller amounts of seasonings when given a choice will definitely make this again
5,we only made one small change to the recipe we omitted the sage amp added cayenne it was amazing this is our new go to enchilada recipe
5,i loved all the garlic in the sauce my family said that this was their favorite enchilada recipe surprising because i rarely use ground beef in my mexican food recipes listed sodium content is so high i believe to be a typo i still would use reduced sodium canned ingredients and not add the additional salt
5,lots of sauce we loved it
5,i added rotel to the meat to add a little heat yummy
5,these are awesome the beef filling is my favorite but the sauce is very yummy too i happen to have fresh garlic from our farmers market and this recipe really lets it shine my daughter cant wait for them to come out of the oven after sampling the filling
5,the best enchilada ive ever eaten in my life the meat mixture is soooo delicious i use it to make nachos as well by far a must have on any monthly menu plan d
5,i never comment on recipes but this was amazing i only used cloves of minced garlic in the sauce and next time i will use this is just an awesome dish there is no way that person who wrote it is bland followed the directions it is anything but bland wow i love mexican food and this is so easy
5,absolutely delicious such good flavor and the sauce was the greatest nothing like that can enchilada sauce the only thing i will do different next time is double the sauce and add an additional oz can of tomato sauce very very good really the person who said these were bland have no taste buds i substituted the stewed tomatoes for a can of rotel like another reviewer did excellent
5,my entire family loves this recipe variations use cooked turkey or chicken instead of beef great way to use up leftover thanksgiving turkey add a small layer of cannned refried beans to the tortilla before rolling up
5,very good makes a lot which i like my husband and i love mexican flavors and this tasted just as good as going out for enchiladas soo yummy
5,ive been looking for this recipe for years it was a staple in my home and i lost my recipe folder in a move thank you thank you
5,pthis recipe rocks my family and friends love it it is my go to recipe for something different in the weekly meal planning been making it for years cant go wron making this one the only thing i change is i delete the salt and you cant even tell its missing great job and thankyou very muchp
5,omgthese are amazing most enchilada recipes i have call for storebought enchilada sauce or a mix of other stuff that isnt very enchiladay tasting this sauce was fab the beef is fab love love love my family loved it this is companygood for a casual meal
5,love these i actually made more last time to have some extra sauce and meat and thats tonights nachos thanks for the recipe
5,incredible such a homemade taste the spices were perfect nice creamy tasty sauce and the amounts were great for our taste enough sauce but not swimming in it i did spread the sauce all over the top of the rolled tortillas once they were in the pan as another reviewer said and it really kept them from being too dry and crunchy i made the whole recipe then split it into two inch glass dishes two whole dinners for my husband and me
5,i usually like to make green sauce enchiladas after making this i dont know if ill ever beable to go back these are by far the best beef enchiladas i have ever had i love garlic so add more than the recipe calls for kudos
5,loved by boys and a dad
5,these were great definitely my new go to beef enchilada recipe
5,i love this recipe the sauce is so good who would ever buy sauce i cant decide if i like it better with flour tortillas or corn great standby recipe
5,this recipe is great easy to make tastes as good as any mexican restaurant my son requests this at least once a week
5,very very very good lots of flavor enough spice to give it a kick but not overwhelming will definately make it again i did change one thing used lbs beef cause lb didnt seem enough
5,loved this recipe great flavors and different from my regular enchiladas it was a nice change making them again tonight for cinco de mayo
5,the only change we will be making next time is to make more sauce delicious recipe though
5,this is really tasty my whole family enjoyed even my kids i used corn tortillas for myself to make it glutenfree i found i had to dipbrush sauce on both sides to keep them from breaking i left out the flour in the filling and used cup cornstarch in place of the flour in the sauce to make it gf i just added the cornstarch to the broth i think this would taste good with beans either in the filling or on the side next time i might try reducing the butter has anyone tried that
5,the homemade sauce is heavenly
5,we have been making this recipe for years and we love it we prefer corn tortillas and double the sauce
5,it doesnt look anything like the picture but its excellent
5,delicious i didnt add any salt and used low sodium broth and they turned out great for the sauce i used the tsp of chilli powder cumin and sage and still had enough kick for us will make again
5,absolutely delicious if you like use shredded cooked chicken in the filling add after the onions are cooked in a little olive oil instead of the beef substitute chicken broth for the beef broth
5,loved it very yummy and easy to change to different tastes so glad to now have a recipe that doesnt need canned enchilada sauce we will be making this often serves a crowd for very little cost
5,made this last night and it was delicious the standout for me was the sauce if i made it again i would definitely cut down on the sugar but otherwise it was perfect
5,i always make the recipe my own i buttered the dish and dusted it with a cinnamon sugar mix cinnamon sugar mixture cup granulated sugar tsp cinnamon whatever cinn sugar is leftover i added to the cake batter mix i used c unsweetened applesauce to substitute cut up apples i used tsp pure vanilla extract then i added tsp ground cloves in addition to spices it baked in minutes using a pyrex dish i also made the butterscotch sauce my family liked it it could stand alone without sauce or frosting lt is delicious
5,loved loved loved it im so glad i only used one cup of sugar instead of two as the apples provide a lot of sweetness as well turned out delicious
5,i tried this recipe a few years ago and it is now a fall tradition in our home my family asks me to make it every october the cinnamon flavor and chunks of apple make it delicious i serve it with the yummy caramel sauce and homemade whipped cream this sweet dessert gets stars
5,hello i made this chunky apple cake last family party it was a huge hit the cake the sauce omg was really really good ill keep making this for special events thank you so much
5,love this cake and everyone i make it for does too
5,wow this was delicious i accidentally put eggs and i used about cups apples and it still came out perfect i just drizzled the sauce over the whole cake while it was still warm definitely will make again
5,i got this recipe from my husbands grandmother and have made it for years but i add raisins nuts and sweetened coconut flakes
5,this dish is so delicious i also use the meat recipe for tacos this is a recipe that i will use over and over again thanks
5,this is well worth the time it takes in the kitchen every time i make it the sauce is so delicious i end up scraping the pan and licking the spoon the other night i made the meat filling from this recipe put it in some store bought tostada bowls with some salad fixings it was a big hit my kids are not fans of enchiladas so i save some tortillas when i make the enchiladas and make soft tacos for them
5,if i am lazy and dont want to make the meat sauce i squish up my homemade chili that i always keep a supply of in the freezer and use it instead and i agree with mattnat i could practically drink the sauce
5,excellent recipe for mexican fare
5,i substituted a can of rotel tomatoes for the tomato sauce with great results it gave it a nice extra kick
5,jennifer this recipe is outstanding hubby raves about it everytime i make it
5,scott what on earth did you do i have made this cake at least times since it was first published in it was delicious every single time the batter is full of apples so the first time i made it i wasnt sure there would be enough batter to hold it together but there was i am often asked to bring this cake to parties gettogethers school events etc im printing out a new copy of the recipe bc mine is so smudged up from using so many times
5,i just made this recipe i was a bit hesitant when i read scotts review but i decided to try it i had to cut it in half because theres just two of us and it turned out moist and tasty i did reduce my bake time to min because i prepared a x pan the dough is stiff as it mentions i didnt have beaters so i used a wooden spoon for stirring turned out good with a little more effort
5,love it perfect for the fall
5,made this for my husbands collector club i didnt have the spices individually so i used apple pie spice it worked well i didnt have time to make the butterscotch sauce but the cake itself was sweet enough one of my husbands friends went back for seconds
5,delicious this is my go to apple cake everyone loves itwith the sauce
5,i use to make this all the time my exmotherinlaw taught it to me but she always sliced not diced her apples and never used any topping other than an occasional sprinkling of powdered sugar it was one of the few cakes that my stepdad a type diabetic could eat once in a while ive made this both ways and its awesome either way but i think i lean more towards the no icing and sliced apples
5,when i put this recipe together the batter was extremely thick and i could barely fold in the apples i struggled to press it into the x pan i thought for sure i would have to throw it out the next day and find another recipe for the birthday party to my amazement it cooked perfectly and my family loved it i will use this recipe without fear for any occasion
5,i have made this for years it was called apple dapple cake
5,i already left my review but wanted to say i did find that i needed the full teaspoon of baking soda for the half recipe so im thinking a full teaspoon for the whole cake at any rate really awesome recipe
5,really great flavor and easy to make i used a food processor for the apples and cut the calories by using egg beaters lf yogurt spread brummel amp brown and monk fruit with a little splenda to sweeten it since i cant have a lot of sugar served with with a cup of hot latte its so comforting especially on a chilly fall afternoon next time ill add raisins keeps well in the fridge this is a keeper
5,ive made this a few times now and its always a big hit after reading the reviews i chose to use cup of sugar and cup of brown sugar rather than cups of white sugar its sweet enough and had an amazing texture the last time i made it i also tried slicing the apples rather than cutting them into chunks and my husband preferred it this way this is such an easy and delicious recipe thanks
5,every fall i make this cake usually with a mixture of different apples since i gather an assortment at the local farm it has become a favorite amongst my family and friends with or without the sauce or whipped creme the apple contest winners issue is one of my favorites we also look forward to the apple stuffed french toast
5,excellent cake since i dont like nutmeg i added extra cinnamon yum constance please post the apple stuffed french toast thanks connie
5,my family loved this soup we all added hamburger pickle slices to our individual bowls and it gave it a whole new flavor fantastic
5,great recipe made almost exactly as written left out the sour cream since it was already so creamy my husband and i both loved it and cant wait to make it again
5,my entire family loved this recipe they usually dont like much so that is a huge compliment
5,absolutely fantastic followed the recipe exactly it was really delicious definitely will make again
5,my family just loves this delicious hearty and creamy soup i make a double batch and freeze it for lunches
5,second time i have made this soup and its excelent my family loves it i used ground deer meat this time
5,made this hearty and tasty soup for the first time tonight i made the following changes and it turned out delicious increased the meat to increased the onions carrots and celery to cup each slightly increased all the remaining ingredients except for the salt which i decreased to teas used low sodium chicken broth used shredded cheddar and velveeta cheese its a bit of work and makes a large batch but its good
5,i made this recipe as is but for my second bowl i added ketchup amp mustard and it was delicious definitely tasted like a cheeseburger
5,i have been making this recipe for years and my family loves it i add a large cloves of chopped garlic to give it a garlic burger taste
5,i have been making this soup for quite a few years and continue to receive raving comments when serving it to guests it has great flavor when reheated too
5,this was outstanding great comforting soup
5,excellent flavor and texture nice spices simple ingredients it becomes more creamy as you stir it the potato cubes become mashed
5,absolutely the perfect dessert easy to make and delicious to eat a definite keeper
5,really good i had a dinner party and the person who was supposed to bring dessert couldnt make it i didnt have everything the recipe called for i used ingredients i had on hand to create this yummy cake i only had braeburn apples left over from a fruit salad so i used that and a cup of applesauce i used cup of white sugar and cup of brown i also only used a teaspoon of nutmeg and teaspoon of cloves teaspoons vanilla and teaspoons baking power teaspoon of baking soda i baked these into cupcakes at for minutes i didnt make the topping but just dusted the tops with powdered sugar the batter was kind of like cookie dough these were mouse and delicious everyone really enjoyed these and said i should make again
5,reduced sugar to cups and left out cinnamon as i dont care for it it turned out really well loved the butterscotch sauce which was wonderful with the whipped cream good compliments were received
5,phenomenal cake
5,i took this cake to a party this past weekend and it disappeared in a heartbeat everyone wanted the recipe it is moist and delicious and easy to make i will definitely be baking this again soon
5,great cake i did toss the apples in some butter and cinnamon sugar before adding them to the cake mix
5,this is awesome cakebut i only use cup of sugarand that is still plenty sweetespecially with the sauce on top most of the time i dont even use the sauce because the cake is delicious by itself and i only sprinkle confectioners sugar on top just before serving easy and delicious
5,i decreased the amount of sugar per previous reviewers recommendations to cup sugar i didnt spend the times and effort making the sauce rather some caramel syrup and whipped cream instead this cake doesnt really need any toppings as it is delicious by itself
5,what this cake lacks in a lovely presentation it makes up for in flavor it was moist
5,this is a great cake kinda had a panic moment when i found out there wasnt enough cinnamon in the pantry so i put what cinnamon and nutmeg was back on the shelf and grabbed the pumpkin pie spice threw in a scant tblsp problem solved there will be a next time making this cake so itll be to try the original as written version
5,delicious i followed some of the suggestions and used cup of white sugar and i cup of brown sugar added cup of raisins and just sprinkled with powdered sugar frosting or sauce is not needed
5,absolutely delicious i also used cup of white sugar and cup of brown sugar added tsp more of cinnamon doubled the butterscotch sauce and cooked for minutes or so for thicker consistency i served it warm with the sauce and a scoop of french vanilla ice cream my son and his wife took half the cake home for their family and will be bringing me more apples to make this again
5,easy and delicious a great way to use some of the abundance of apples we have at this time of year this came out picture perfect i used half and half and the sauce was great really liked it
5,so very moist turned out great followed the recipe to a t it stayed very fresh on the counter for days i poured the sauce on each piece right before serving to keep the cake from getting soggy simply delicious
5,the best apple cake ever
5,this was fresh and delicious easy to make and love the spices a keeper for sure thanks debi
5,best apple cake i have ever made
5,this is a really good cake when i spread it into the pan it seemed like more apple than cake didnt look like it would ever make a cake the juice from the apples mixed with the batter and made a nice moist apple pie cake everyone loved it
5,i pocked the cake all over and poured the caramel sauce over the cake right out of the oven so good
5,i have made this recipe numerous times over the years and it is a decadent family favorite making again today
5,this is a fantastic recipe i must have looked at recipes before choosing this one i wanted a recipe that used a lot of apples and used butter instead of oil the reviews of most of the recipes said they cut the amount of oil and still made a too moist or oily cake this is a moist cake but not too moist the batter is stiff until you add the apples it easily spread into the pan i wanted to taste more apple so cut the nutmeg in half it was perfect you can still taste the nutmeg but its not overpowering i bought caramel sauce instead of making the butterscotch sauce the cake is great even without any sauce my husband said this recipe was definitely a keeper
5,this was a great apple cake i had never made one before so when the batter was stiff i was at the concernedbut sure enough it turned out fabulous i didnt bring any home from my dinner party it was delicious with or without the sauce
5,ive made this recipe numerous times and always get raving reviews best apple cake recipe by far
5,easy the sauce was the best will uses sauce for other receipts
5,this desert was so good made it for thanksgiving and it went over very well will make again and again
5,definitely a keeper apple recipe i used newtown pippin applesgreat chunky flavor i too had to bake the cake an extra minutes each time ive made it the top doesnt spring back so i look for a goldenbrown top instead the sauce is nice but not necessary i took the advice of another reviewer and used butterscotch topping instead this cake is fine served at any temperature this cake is a contest winner for sure
5,very good i took the advise of the other comments amp only used tsp nutmeg i also didnt make the sauce because i didnt have the cream my family thought it was good just as it was a keeper
5,this cake is so good i cut down on the sugar in the cake and sauce my husband absolutely loved it and he preferred it without the sauce i like it with the sauce so its wonderful either way
5,i made the cake asis and it was perfect i wouldnt change a thing except that with my oven i needed about minutes more baking time oh and i used different types of apples granny smith jazz pink lady and braeburn as others have stated the batter was indeed quite stiff but my little sunbeam mixer could still handle it when it was time to stir in the apples the fruittobatter ratio was very high no wonder this cake is so incredibly moist speaking of whichdont worry if the surface of your cake is hard and crusty when it comes out of the oven after its mostly cooled cover it with foil and it will resolve itself shortly to become uniformly moist and tender as with most cakes its better the second day i think the cake stands on its own without the sauce but that punch of sweetness is a nice treat i added a few drops of butterrum extract just for fun i will make this sauce again for other things ice cream or a dip for apples for example five stars
5,delicious cake i too cut the sugar in half but added cup of walnuts with melted butter and brown sugar mixed together as a topping great with or without the sauce i have made this three times in the last month with many compliments thank you debi for the recipe
5,using granny smith apples provided the right tartness level to balance out the sweetness of the sauce we thought the recipe was perfect as is i even had a guest sneak another helping right out of the pan in the kitchen
5,oh my i knew this would be good when i read the ingredients but i had no idea that it would be so fabulous it is so full of apples that make it incredibly moist the sauce was the crowning glory i served it with whipped cream but next time will pair it with vanilla bean ice cream i cant wait to make it again
5,i made this for my family and they loved it
5,delicious i used close to cups of chopped apples and it still seemed like a lot i used a caramel whiskey sauce because i already had some made up and a dollop of home made whipping cream and oh was it good i will make the butterscotch sauce the next time and as another person said the cake stands on its own i myself loved the texture of the flaky crunch on top of the cake my husband loves anything baked with apples in it and this one was a big hit
5,this was excellent i tried stirring the apples in for a few seconds and then just used my hands i will definitely make this again
5,best apple cake ever i remember when this won the apple contest
5,a great apple cake that is nice and juicy the butterscotch sauce adds a delectable flavor to this wonderful fall cake dont worry if the batter looks quite thick the juice from the apples helps it cook perfectly
5,great for fall
5,wouldnt change a thing not quick and easy but well worth the trouble i made cream sauce with flour milk and butter then added the cheese then added that to other ingredients whole family loves it
5,this is excellent but i added a minced jalapeno and made it spicy cheeseburger soup
5,ive made this soup twice amp both times it was a huge hit everyone loved it including me
5,buzzbombz why would you give it stars and then post a different recipe you should just review this one and then submit your own separately
5,excellent everyone in the family loved it
5,this is by far my favorite soup i did make some changes to make it less fatting i use turkey burger instead of beef burger and cook the onion celery and carrots with the meat ommiting the butter i used skim milk and velveeta cheese and thickened it with cornstarch and cold water i also use fat free sour cream i have made this soup several times and it is sooooo good
5,this soup is so flavorful with some crusty bread it was the perfect meal for us
5,this was a super tasty soup that my whole family enjoyed hard to do when you have a carnivore an herbivore and an omnivore at the same table i added bacon to it and it was delicious will definitely be making this again
5,just want to say i like buzzbombz suggestions keep up the good work
5,what a great recipe i live in washington state and i am always on the lookout for apple recipes it turned out great the first time i made it thanks for sharing
5,this is the second time making it the first time was when it came out as the grand prize winner in i dont change a thing and its perfect the amount of sauce is perfect with the cake any more would make it too sweet and some have said that the amount of nutmeg was a bit much but i didnt think so its a matter of taste i served it with a side of butter pecan ice cream wonderful
5,ive been making this almost every year since is appeared in the toh magazine i remember how wowed we were at the first bite i havent met a person yet who didnt love this prizewinning chunky apple cake it definitely is a falltime favorite in this house mmmmmm good and the sauce is so delish
5,so good my husband almost ate half of it in one sitting loved the sauce i didnt have the cream so i used half and half then put a couple tablespoons of flour in it to thicken it up
5,my family loves this cake i make it at least twice a year
5,love making seasonal cakes for the family they loved it will be a keeper
5,so yummy and easy to make everyone loved it
5,i used frozen peaches
5,i have made this often its amazing
5,this is the first time ive ever posted a recipe review i had to cook this about mins longer than suggested but the result was quite simply the best cake i have ever tasted my friends family everyone agreed better after day in the pan covered with foil it just got more and more moist as time went on i didnt make the sauce its sweet enough it doesnt need it though my little boy really liked it with cream poured over the top we live in london they do that here amazing
5,this was very good i didnt have all six cups of apples i only had granny smith and fugi which gave me close to it didnt matter because it was still full of apples and really delicious the crust on top was crispy after baking so i wasnt able to test with the spring back like a regular cake recipe so just use a toothpick to test it almost tastes like an apple crisp cake i have to add the i didnt make the sauce and it was sweet enough without it my boyfriend doesnt eat sweets and thinks its too sweet but i cant stop eating it i gave some to my family and they loved it too i will probably make it again
5,i just made it for the second time tonight its amazing and the butterscotch sauce and fresh whipped cream are an amazing combination
5,is vry delicious even without the topping i didnt have time to make the butterscotch topping but served it with ice cream and hot caramel topping instead it was fabulous i also omitted the nutmeg since im not a fan of it still turned out great will keep this recipe on hand for a different fall apple dessert
5,wow is all i can say made it for a special family dinner and everyone loved it i used granny smith apples and followed the recipe to a tee my only adjustment was to bake it a little bit longer until done
5,ok i cheatedlol i couldnt help it i used honeycrisp apples cut the nutmeg in half used cup less sugar added a spoon of molasses added cup raisins added cup apple ciderbut anyway it turned out great
5,the sauce reheats in the microwave very well ive toted this cake the sauce in a covered microwaveable container and a can of redi whip into the office on several occasions nuke the sauce stirring a couple of times just before you serve the cake it helps if you use a small gravy ladle to pour the sauce over the cake
5,i cut the nutmeg in half but otherwise followed the directions it was sooooo yummy
5,amazing taste and extremely moist a huge hit at work
5,excellent with no changes to the recipe i will make this again and again
5,i have made this recipe many many times to rave reviews i made a few changes like adding a streusel topping along with chopped walnut on top the crumbly nutty top tastes very good with the sauce
5,i had never made apple cake before this my family really enjoyed it i made it in a lasagna pan because there were so many apples i used large granny smiths the sauce was thin so i whisked in some powdered sugar to thicken it i served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream it was delicious
5,i made this the other day for my husband and it was fabulous very flavorful and moist didnt change a think on the recipe i would make it again any day thanks for the recipe
5,tried this recipe a the assisted living facility i work forit was awesome the residents loved iti had to double the recipe but left the amount of apple the same as for one i also shredded the applesthe caramel sauce made the desertwill definated make this one again
5,excellent recipe very moist and delicious
5,it has become my new best birthday cake anyone that tastes it raves it has a texture a little like bread pudding its great
5,real good with vanilla ice cream
5,the only thing i would change on this recipe is a little less nutmeg i tasted it too much i also didnt use the sauce on top and it was absolutely delicious without it
5,i got this recipe long ago when it first appeared in the magazine i made it many times for my family until the recipe got lost over a year ago i am so happy to find it here again the only thing i do differently is that i only use teaspoon nutmeg so that the nutmeg does not overpower the cake and the butterscotch sauce is delicious
5,this was delicious my one piece of advice would be to make sure you cook it long enough for us the minutes was not long enough it tasted fine raw but better when we cooked it long enough thanks for the recipe
5,this is amazing i put a little more apple in it and use empire apples with peel on some i too use a little less nutmeg and double the sauce everyone loves it i also use cup br sugar instead of cups white
5,ive tried a wide variety of corn pudding recipes and this is the best ive found made it at thanksgiving and everyone loved it this will now be my goto recipe
5,the best ever a family favorite added at my house
5,pelliston i havent made this yet on the schedule for this afternoon but frequently apple cakes have a very thick batter because of the moisture the apples release when cooking update this is great moist lots of apple flavor love the fact that it has so many apples and the butterscotch sauce is perfect with itp
5,i made this cake and brought it into the office along with the sauce which reheats in the microwave beautifully and a can of whipped topping the cake was inhaled by my coworkers in what seemed like a matter of minutes ive made it using a combination of tart and sweet apples when that was all i had on hand and it turned out just as well what an awesome recipe
5,very gooood cakeone i will make againloved the sauce lisa
5,this was so delicious i used heavy cream because my hubby didnt realize it wasnt whipping cream but it didnt make any difference i definitely wont wait until the next holiday season to make this one yum
5,elliston i havent made this yet on the schedule for this afternoon but frequently apple cakes have a very thick batter because of the moisture the apples release when cooking update this is great moist lots of apple flavor love the fact that it has so many apples and the butterscotch sauce is perfect with it
5,such a good cake ill be making it for my farmers market booth this week itll be a hit
5,this recipe was great except i cut the nutmeg way down to teaspoon used tsp vanilla and used mcintosh apples gets more like a bread pudding the longer it sits the caramel sauce is fantastic and makes it
5,i used spice grinders for an explosion of fall flavor what a moist delicious cake like a candied apple but easier to eat i like the nutmeg myself but did add extra vanilla
5,after reading the reviews about the batter being stiff i was a little concerned the catch is that the moisture from the apples cooking puts the added moisture in it is very moist and full of our favorite fall flavors apples cinnamon and nutmeg
5,i will make it again and again everyone in the house loves it if you run out or dont care for butterscotch try a little whipping cream ooooh yum
5,made this tonight for the first timeomg soooo good maybe less nutmeg next time
5,this is great ive made it three times in weeks its a huge hit
5,i made this cake exactly as written it was excellent great for pot lucks if you can keep the delicious sauce warm and top just as you serve it i tried putting it on top and cutting later but makes it very soggy if it sits too long it is the best and yes the i wondered when i made the batter if it would cook up correctly as it didnt seem to have enough liquid but as others have state the apples have a lot of moisture and the cake turns out wonderful this is a keeper and we will have at thanksgiving time
5,i used this recipe and me and my mom loved it i used sugar instead of cup and i did cup of sour cream instead of cup came out perfectly
5,fabulous recipe i used greek yogurt instead of the sour cream and reduced the sugar to cup i took the test kitchens suggestion and added cup of cheddar cheese and a cup of chopped green chilies we really enjoyed this recipe vfe
5,i get rave reviews for this dish every time and many request the recipe im in my kitchen now making another batch to bring to thanksgiving dinner have a happy one everybody
5,i made this today to bring for a family potluck and it was a hit i am definitely making it at home again
5,have made this many timesthe family requests it for all our get togetherswe prefer it with green chilies and cheddar cheese addedyummy
5,this is so quick and easy to prepare and tastes amazing my family loved it will make it again for sure it is creamy goodness with crispy browned edgesyum
5,my friends and family told me last night that this is cornbread crack lol everyone loved it so much super easy to make too
5,this is fabulous i have made other recipes that my husband thought were sort of ok he loves this fluffy moist delicious
5,i made this recipe on what a scrumptious recipe a real keeper too i did use a smaller can of creamed corn oz and the standard size of golden kernel corn well drained and used a qt square casserole dish i found that i needed to bake the pudding at least hour due to the lower oven temperature this pudding was really moist and fluffy thank you for sharing this recipe with taste of home
5,this recipe tastes very similar to the recipe that has been served at our past family thanksgivings im so happy to find a corn pudding recipe thats moist and sweet
5,this is delicious it took me minutes in an oval casserole dish to look set in the middle i opened my cans to find that they were both creamed corn so i found a oz bag of frozen corn that i microwaved for a few minutes to defrost and it worked perfectly i plan to make this recipe all the time
5,this moist corn pudding recipe was quick to prepare and everyone loved it i doubled the recipe for thanksgiving and will definitely be making this again
5,got rave reviews at my christmas dinner delicious
5,awesome kids loved it highly recommendused bacon in it and it was greatkids asked for seconds
5,this is my second time making great recipe the only thing i did different was adding hot sausage with the hamburger i would make again this is a keeper
5,this is really good i added a can of drained diced tomatoesleft out the salt the velveeta has enough for us yum
5,excellent excellent excellent made this for my household and the neighbors and all six people raved about it will definitely make it again
5,i make this often wonderful flavor my and year old grandkids were over and couldnt get enough of it
5,i have been making this soup for over yrs it is a favorite with my family
5,this was a fun soup to serve everyone added their favorite condiments it was very thick so i added an extra cup of chicken broth and skipped the flour also i did use of burger which made it thicker
5,i make this regularly for my husband and i and occasionally for a potluck everyone raves about it i frequently add a cup or so of cheddar but we really like cheese here love it
5,love it i make it for my family and occasionally for a work potluck it always gets rave reviews sometimes i add a cup of cheddar to it we like it cheesy here
5,i made this for our family of six last night it doubles well but takes longer than the given times all of my children ate it without complaining which is a huge achievement three of them gave it compliments i added some petite frozen peas partially defrosted at the end of the cooking time to add some more veggies to our meal i think that it is a new favorite
5,really good my picky grandkids even liked it i doubled the recipe and served two families
5,i make this soup quite frequently its one of our favorites
5,when i made this for thanksgiving years ago everyone loved it it is a staple now
5,the only thing i changed was omitting the sugar and this turned out delicious i did have to bake it longer than directed wonderful dish
5,this recipe was delicious a new addition to our thanksgiving dinner and an instant favorite i did modify slightly by only adding cup of sugar and i substitute a can of kernel corn for frozen corn not to sweet and a great texture
5,this recipe is easier than making the whole thing from scratch which my sister does but tastes equally as delicious my family is over the top so i adjusted the recipe added an extra cup of sugar and an extra can of corn kernels yummy more like a dessert though no more ridiculous than candied yams i guess funny how we can turn perfectly healthy foods in to either candy or a heart attack happy thanksgiving
5,loved this recipe baked it longer than it said though and im wondering if theres a way to make it in a crock pot instead
5,it has become a family favorite i always make it on a glass mold so has worked fine with me
5,simply delicious i added tsp vanilla cinnamon and other spice mix
5,this is a complete favorite of all my friends family and co workers i do not modify anything other than a few more minutes cook time and i use light sour cream for all the people saying it takes way longer or is dry how it is not supposed to set from cooking the very center should very slightly jiggle when done and if you poke it with a knife is should partially come out clean if you make this in advance do not over cook it will set as it cools
5,a very similar recipe was given to me by my mother many years ago my version has no eggs or milk and only one tablespoon of sugar i bake it in a deep qt casserole always take it to my office christmas potluck and get rave reviews and no leftovers i like the suggestion of adding green chilies and will definitely try that
5,ive been making this recipe ever since it was introduced in a issue its the one everyone asks for in fact im a little tired of making it for every occasion but people howl when i beg to bring something else it truly is delicious and everyone loves it what more can you ask of a recipe
5,ive been making a this for years with a twist i saute a onion in the butter than pour over top and add a sprinkle of cheese
5,ive been making this for years its a family favorite as another reviewer wrote i also saute an onion in the butter and add to the pudding its a terrific side dish for barbecue in the summer we love it
5,this is a great side dish i would reduce the sugar i found it sweet i would also add some cheese to the mixture next time great thanksgiving side goes great with steak too loved it
5,absolutely fabulous made it exactly as the recipe statedand it was gone in minutes
5,i found this recipe to be very good i found that i did need to bake the pudding longer than recipe specifiedi baked pudding minute and it was not set i baked about minutes longer and used a knife to test the pudding because of the lower oven temperature i felt that the pudding was slower to set delowenstein
5,we make this often i first tasted corn pudding as a side dish at el torito restaurants but their recipe was much more involved my recipe calls for undrained corn no milk and no added sugar you can also make your own cornbread mix if you dont like using packaged mixes
5,my family loves it
5,perfect side dish for any holiday or sunday dinner
5,this has been a staple at our thanksgiving table every year for at least years i also like to make it as an alternative to cornbread as a side dish i include cheddar and diced fresh jalapenos for thanksgiving though its the classic incarnation i dont use canned corn i use frozen as i feel its less mushy than canned
5,made this for thanksgiving today and my skeptical adult daughters who thought corn pudding did not sound very good both loved it made it as outlined in the directions i was impressed with how light and fluffy it turned out cooking time was under minutes both of my girls stated that it reminded them of cornbread stuffing will definitely be making this again
5,i made this recipe last night for my family we had an early thanksgiving due to me having to work i made the recipe just as directed and it turned out amazing my entire family loved it
5,i tried a corn casserole at a bbq and loved it searched around for a similar recipe and this one is it a little sweet with the added sugar it has a creamy corny flavor amp texture very easy to put togetheropen cansbam could make in advance amp reheat can cut into squares amp freeze good base recipe to liven up or just as it is will try a can of mexicorn green chilies cheese fresh corn and onions as others have done took minutes longer since i put it in a deeper corningware ill just use my pyrex x next time a keeper recipe i may never make cornbread again
5,delicious perfect texturenot too runny like some
5,this is so delicious i made it tonight and was just perfect my kids and husband couldnt have enough
5,make it for most holidays never any leftover great taste and easy to prepare
5,love this made it for dinner and its delicious
5,delicious the whole family loved it like a very moist cornbread with some whole kernels in it
5,delicious will definitely make it again although i might use less sugar the cornbread mix i used was very sweet
5,yummy this will be a family favorite
5,very good i make it for family dinners
5,this was the first time i had made any version of corn pudding and it was a huge hit our group of adults and kids finished the pan everyone went back for seconds it was the only part of the thanksgiving meal that wasnt leftover so the next day when we were getting ready to eat the leftovers my husband insisted i make another pan i did cook it longer the first time and preferred it compared to the recipe cook time but that was the only change
5,a wonderful firsttime addition to our thanksgiving meal that will now become a family tradition the whole family from youngest to oldest loved it i followed the recipe as written except i substituted about cups of our homegrown frozen corn for the whole kernel corn
5,i made this for thanksgiving and it came out really nice i used no sugar since i was using sweet corn and also egg whites i plan to make some more tomorrow and will be using less butter i plan to keep making this i absolutely love it
5,made this for thanksgiving very good i added tab sugar used x pan was perfect
5,i made this for thanksgiving to try something new everyone loved it it was easy and so very yummy
5,made this a few weeks ago and again tonight it is very good my husband loves this recipe i have never heard of corn pudding before so i thought i would try it im glad i did
5,i made the exact recipe as is and it is wonderful everyone loves iti do add a little cayenne pepper to the top while its baking for looks
5,this is great as written but i tried to cut a few calories and that works too try omitting the eggs milk and sugar or at least reduce sugar to c it is still wonderful melt the butter and mix all ingredients together sometimes when it is done i sprinkle top with cheddar cheese or jack cheese if you want a little bite and put back in oven until it melts it doesnt need a lot of cheese any which way this is good eatin
5,best corn pudding i ever had
5,i added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and crumbled ritz crackers on top before baking it took nearly twice the time stated for it to set up but was the surprise hit of a holiday potluck i also had to turn the oven up to after the first minutes it was that runny
5,made this as written except used whole milk came out as described in recipe family and i liked will make again i thought it was even better the next day
5,this was very good i made this during the holidays and there wasnt any left it was a great alternative to just plain corn
5,to bad its not healthy because its absolutely the best corn casserole ive ever made
5,this is very good and is always a staple at our thanksgiving table everyone loves it but i do add strips of green yellow and red bell peppers for color and taste as well as diced onions my recipe was nearly identical from an insert in our electric bill but called for two cans of whole kernel and two cans of cream style plus cup flour rather than the cornbread mix delicious nevertheless
5,this has replaced dressing at thanksgiving and christmas any leftovers my kids want to take home i only use tablespoon of sugar and do add a finely chopped jalapeno red pepper and onion but it is good with or without
5,my husband and i love this recipe i fixed it last nightbut i left out the butter sugar and substituted plain yogurt instead of the sour cream i used two boxes of jiffy mix and some no salt herbal seasoning from dollar tree turned out great and with a lot less calories and fat
5,this was so easy and it was the hit of the dinner i get so tired of just corn which is the only vegetable my husband wants for holidays this was a great substitute for just corn
5,this is terrific i added chopped jalapeo and red peppers to the recipe it quickly disappeared very tasty
5,everyone has their favorite substitutions i used skim milk less sugar and it is delicious i want to try it with asparagus spears on the top that might be yummy
5,excellent recipe i think i used a quart dish so it took longer to bake but it was a great sweettasting corn dish
5,i used cup sugar as suggested by others this was great everyone enjoyed it i made it in a round dish with high sides and it was a bit undercooked in the middle next time ill use a x pan thanks for sharing
5,this was the third corn pudding recipe that i have tried it was the charm its sweet and cakelike its just been voted new favorite comfort food in our household the fact that it is super easy to make is a definite working moms plus as suggested i only used cup of sugar and jiffy mix and its perfectly sweet
5,i made this to take to christmas dinner with friends amp all people including me loved it i cut the sugar down to cup as many reviewers suggested amp it was just perfect this was a great side dish with ham amp green beans plus orangecranberry relish foolproof amp pleasing to all ill definitely make it again
5,this is a wonderful recipe and we will make it again in the future
5,absolute perfection
5,my husband doesnt like creamed corn but hell eat it in this recipe great to take to a potluck
5,delicious both my mom and i have made this many times the only change we make is to use cans of whole kernel corn and leave out the creamed corn great side for a holiday or company meal
5,this is really good my sister in law makes corn pudding for family gatherings and i always enjoyed it i decided i would make this to go with my mothers day ham this year i used house of autry cornbread mix i like to by local and their products are made in nc
5,there needs to be one more star for this recipe i cut the milk a little and bake it in a large glass casserole dish for best results excellent with soup stew bbq chicken and game
5,i usually make corn pudding without cornbread mix but was pleasantly suprised at how much we enjoyed this one too
5,i make this often without the sugar and milk but im looking forward to trying it with the sugar and milk i bet my grandkids will like it better with the sugarlol
5,my family has made this for years and its just not a holiday without it we make it exactly as written there may be green bean casserole leftovers but never corn casserole leftovers
5,this is so wonderful everyone loves it it does tend to be sweet so feel free to cut the sugar back if you choose
5,this was a new addition to our table this thanksgiving there was not a kid or grownup all people who attended who didnt rave about this recipe i decided not to use the cup sugarand it was just sweet enough without it ive already been asked to add this to our christmas menu
5,i made this recipe this week for a dinner party it is easy excellent good consistency but the next time i will use c sugar instead of seemed a bit too sweet i got a lot of compliments on it though and will definitely make it again and again
5,guests love this dish i always make it at the holidays
5,this is outstanding and so easy to make to kick it up a bit we added a can of diced green chiles as well we also sometimes use c maple syrup instead of sugar so good
5,this dish is a must have for every holiday meal but it is easy enough and good enough to have for tuesday night dinner my family loves it and requests it often
5,the only adjustment i would make to this recipe is to omit the sugar completely i have always made this recipe without sugar it is not needed
5,zero sugar needed i have been making this recipe for a long time i also cut butter down to cup and use lowfat sour cream with no negative effects tastes great
5,i added sauted green pepper and onion to add and then put in a small can of diced green chiles this was a suggestion from a friend in arizona good every way
5,my niece made this for thanksgiving it was so good yes i will make it
5,this recipe is wonderful i did omit the sugar as suggested delicious rather simple and ill definitely make this again my family men said the recipe is a keeper

5,i have always loved this recipe does anyone know if it can be doubled or tripled and can it be made the day before and reheated for the big event
5,this is a great recipe i sometimes use mexican style corn in place of the whole kernel corn sometimes i put in chopped jalapeno with it left overs are great too
5,this is excellent it tastes very similar to the baked corn that a local restaurant sometimes serves next time i will decrease or eliminate the sugar since it was a little on the sweet side for us
5,i added chopped green onions to it loved it
5,this is a wonderful recipe everyone loved it and we didnt have any left overs at all which i was hoping for so i could eat some later will make this again for sure

5,this soup is so good i have to be careful not to make it to often
5,great soup i followed the recipe exactly but then ended up adding a tsp of dijon mustard at the end for a little kick

5,i have made this soup for years its still a favorite of my kids my son continues to request it when he comes over for a meal i make a big batch so that we can have leftovers in the fridge for a couple of days afterward hearty and delicious

5,ive had this recipe in my file for years and made it again the other night my entire family even the complainers about soup love this recipe its fairly easy to make and very hearty i use ground turkey instead of ground beef and its delicious glad to rediscover it and will be making it more frequently
5,this is handsdown my all time favorite chili recipe and fallwinter recipe in general ive been making it for probability years now ill use ground beef often when that is what i have on hand with beef or chicken stock and it always turns out great i typically use lbs of ground because my family prefers meatier chilis soups and sauces

5,everyone looks forward to this recipe and it goes well with a picnic or a more elegant meal
5,absolutely never fails to be really delicious and has become a familyfriends favorite
5,even my very fussy daughter liked this a great sidedish for when everyones tired of the more usual veggies and its a pudding in the same way a plum pudding is called a pudding a more british version of pudding than what most americans envision
5,i have been making this recipie for years but i never put sugar and it is just as good
5,pyuuuuummmyyyyyy this dish is sooooo good my family raved about it to everyone totally making this one again p
5,family loves this i use tomatoes with green chilies to give it some kick
5,this is one of our favorite chili recipes i usually substitute ground turkey ground beef or ground venison for the cubed turkey and it tastes just as good
5,great recipe slow cooking is great but it can be made a lot healthier instead of a crockpot i used mec pure clay pot for this recipe it cooked a lot faster and the flavor was all natural and enhanced you should try that and i promise youd never cook in a crockpot again
5,ive made this over and over we all love it it doesnt take the place of a traditional beef chili if that it what you crave but i wouldnt expect it to wonderful recipe
5,i made this today and ate this for dinner i thought it was easy to make and it was delicious
5,this is a fantasticly tasty recipe i used cooked ground turkey and tricolor peppers i also added a bit more cumin and chili powder served with diced red onion mexican cheese and scoops
5,ill never understand why people insist on changing things about the recipe then rating it especially giving it a bad rating you didnt technically make the recipe so dont rate it that being said this chilisoup is awesome just as it is i make it multiple times throughout the fall and winter i freese it in singleswvings in ziplocks and have a ready to heat and eat lunch the pumpkin gives it a richness without tasting pumpkiny just the right amount of spice
5,this is really a very good recipes
5,this is so good i used about small sweet orange peppers as thats what i had this is going on our regular rotation jane b
5,i have been making this for years as a fall and winter staple we use ground turkey and double the recipe every time i make it a little bit different and it never disappoints we love to use chicken bone broth and swap out a can of corn for a can of the beans since i double it i use cans of beans and used whatever is on hand but always keeping at least can of black beans in this freezes well and everyone loves it
5,i pondered over this recipe for a while thinking about pumpkin in soup im really glad i tried it because it is one of my favorite soups filling amp good for you with delicious ingredients thanks deborah amp taste of home
5,this was excellent thank you
5,loved this i used ground pork because i had it you can probably use any ground or shredded meat i added a cup of salsa and a little more chili powder i will add another can of pumpkin next time and a couple jalapenos toss a little grated cheese on topdefinitely a keeper
5,wonderful i used chicken instead of turkey and fresh parsley instead of dried
5,wonderful and creamy
5,this was a tasty recipe and it made the whole house smell wonderful as it was cooking i took this to a work potluck and the flavors melded nicely for a couple of days before i reheated it you could really taste all the spices and the pumpkin added a depth of flavor that people couldnt quite figure out what it was until i told them very sublime great recipe thank you
5,ive made this recipe a couple of times for my annual super bowl party ive made it with the ground turkey and also made it without turkey and with vegetable broth to accommodate a vegetarian guest both times the chili was delicious the pumpkin gives it nice flavor and texture so easy to throw together and it cooks in slow cooker while im preparing appetizers and side dishes ive made rice on the side and offer cheddar cheese and sour cream for those who want such have it on hand from the other dishes i make for my party also offer tabasco for guests who want more kick its my favorite goto chili recipe
5,so delicious had it not been for all the great reviews i might have just passed on this recipe so glad i didnt the only changes i made were to increase the salt and add a little pepper i also used red peppers instead of yellow and chicken instead of turkey since that is what i had on hand my whole family loved this and my kids didnt even suspect there was pumpkin in it this is so much healthier than my other chili i will definitely be making this on a regular basis and fyi this is even better the next day
5,one of our favorites freezes well too
5,this is one of my favorite soups for fall winter sometimes i use rotisserie chicken instead or leave out the meat all together works great divided up in freezer bags and taken for lunch
5,ive made this in the past and its always good its nutritious and easily edible by children
5,i leave out the meat to make it meatless excellent recipe
5,excellent recipe the ingredients are surprising but meld perfectly the pumpkin adds to the flavor and texture but is not really detectable which we liked this recipe is easy inexpensive and my family loved it i will be making this regularly i made it with leftover turkey as directed this time but will try with ground turkey at other times of the year the only modifications i made were to use a red bell pepper because that is what i had and i added a little black pepper
5,wow wow wow winner winner turkey dinner
5,husband says its a keeper i found this when looking for a different recipe for my leftover thanksgiving turkey i used leftover mashed sweet potatoes instead of pumpkin subbed white beans great northern since i didnt have black beans on hand and my canned diced tomatoes included green chilies it was delicious
5,i made this without the meat i didnt have any used vegetable broth not because im vegetarian but because its what i had on hand and i oven roasted about a pound of pumpkin chunks from a small pumpkin and pureed it i also used a can of rotel instead of diced tomatoes roasting the pumpkin made it really yummy
5,ive made this or times now most recently for a halloween themed potluck at work because we were supposed to come up with a spooky theme i labeled it pumpkin chile with black beetles the beetles of course were the black beans i didnt have any turkey so i sprinkled some southwestern style seasoning on a package of chicken thighs after removing the skin and baked them when the thighs cooled off i chopped them up and added them to the chili i usually cook this on the stove top since i m not patient enough to wait for the slow cooker i made a double batch and poured as much as i could fit into the slow cooker the next morning several coworkers took some of the leftovers home for dinner it did come out a little soupy add broth gradually but it tasted great
5,a very easy recipe to follow and one i make with very few changes no yellow pepper but the canned tomatoes are fire roasted and use lb browned ground turkey more chili like a definite keeper and one for those cold rainysnowy nights served with fritoes on top
5,my entire family loved this recipe an easy recipe to make that tastes great i was short on time so i skipped the slow cooker and cooked it on the stove top for minutes couldnt find chunked pumpkin so i used oz of frozen sweet potatoes and oz of frozen butternut squash i will be making this recipe often
5,soup is delicious and what a nice change from your typical chili even my picky husband loved it after he had a bowl i told him pumpkin was in it and he gave me the getoutofhere donttellmethat look i just laughed and i dont know if he realizes pumpkin is really in it or not but eating bowls means he thoroughly enjoyed it it is a very easy recipe the only changes i made was i baked chicken tenders because that it is what i had in the house to add to the chili and simmered soup on the stove for minutes instead of in the slow cooker either way delicious for those that gave it or even stars they had to have made a mistakes in making it and if it was too bland spice it up
5,wonderful with leftover turkey
5,excellent twist on chili used pumpkin puree its what i had at hand and added a chunked sweet potato for texture and bulk recipe is quite mild as is i added a tsp of chipotle powder and a bit of crushed pepper in addition to the chili and it still barely tingled good fiber and fairly low net carbs very easy will make again
5,this was a big hit in our house i left the pumpkin part a secret and just told them it was a black bean chili i used chicken tenderloins that i cooked with the onion yellow pepper and garlic i also doubled the salt and added t of ground black pepper i will definitely be making this again
5,we loved it
5,delicious quick and easy i didnt make any changes to the recipe my husband and i loved this it was perfect for lunch on a chilly day
5,very good and healthy i make this often and it freezes well i have also used browned ground turkey and it is a good substitution
5,i made as directed it was wonderful very easy as there wasnt much chopping to do a very hearty chili amp the avocado amp green onion topper was perfect thanks for yet another very good recipe from taste of home
5,this is a simple and good tasting chili
5,this may not have been the quickest soup to throw together but it was well worth it i cant wait to make it again i used t each fresh parsley and basil and i used the whole pound of hamburger which was the right amount compared to the amount of potatoes
5,this is terrific my whole family loves it
5,have made this recipe about times already in the past few months its a family favorite followed the recipe exactly and it has been perfect like comfort food in a soup
5,delicious soup i skipped the basil and added chopped green chile now my hubbys favorite soup thanks for sharing the recipe
5,sooo yummy
5,this soup got rave reviews from my hungry hunters last night to shorten up the prep time i have used hashbrowns and frozen celeryonioncarrots we garnished it with shredded cheddar and crispy bacon definitely a keeper recipe
5,our whole family loves this recipelove when the cooler weather gets here so i can get back to making it wouldnt change a thing
5,the best soup i have ever made cheesey beefy potatoey goodness
5,weve been cooking this soup for over ten years now and we still get request for it at every family get together prep takes a little bit of time but oh so worth it
5,absolutely yummy doubled the beef and cheese and times the broth to make a bigger batch also cooked it slow in my crock pot for hrs
5,i read some of the other reviews so i added some diced tomatos and cayenne powder to give it a kick really thick rich soup that sure works on a rainy winter night
5,ive been making a variation of this for years my husband loves ittip its way easier to add the extra butter and then the flour to the celery and onion mixture than it is to make a separate roux you have more control over how thick your soup will be and you dont have to mess up an extra pan its an extra step thats very unnecessary
5,this was super easy and inexpensive and my fiance loved iti took a few suggestions from other reviewsturkey kielbasa instead of chicken can rotel instead of diced tomatoest chili powder cups chicken broth still a little too soupy for my taste would likely do next timedash of cayenne pepperdash of red pepper flakestsp cinnamon
5,loved this chili its delicious but does not taste like pumpkin at all i used ground turkey instead of cubed and it was delicious
5,made this with leftover christmas turkey you cant taste the pumpkin just a yummy chili hits the spot on cold winter days
5,i love a good traditional beef kidney bean and tomato sauce chili but i think this is one of the best chili recipes i have ever had the flavor is fantastic though a little mild but it is easy to spice up a little more if desired i made it with shredded leftover turkey from thanksgiving
5,this is one great recipe we love in the fall and winter since it gives a great vegatable serving we spice it up a bit by adding some cayenne andor jalepeno peppers
5,this a great one to make for the fall season tasted great i used ground turkey in place of cubed turkey i loved this bc i could also feed this to my son who is now eating solids i just mashed the beans flat with a fork so they were not a choking hazard and broke the ground turkey in small pieces while cooking it
5,love love love we always have a big gathering in the fall with friends and family this is always the favorite
5,love this and its so easy a versatile recipe ingredients are easily swapped out
5,great recipe added a few jalepenoes for heat
5,i made this on the stove top since i was getting dinner started late used diced cooked chicken instead of the turkey because i always have it on hand in the freezer used a full quart of chicken broth cups instead of the cups called for because i like more volume and for the diced tomatoes i used del monte diced tomatoes and zesty jalapenos because my husband and i like spicy it turned out great definitely a keeper
5,im allergic to bell pepper so i substituted thinly sliced carrots for texture and it worked really well also i used ground turkey to come closer to a traditional chili it tasted great next time i might double the batch size and freeze some for later
5,my daughter does not like chili period except this one she cant digest chilipowder foods very well but we have found that when i substitute pumpkin pie spice for most not all of the chili powder and add some brown sugar and a bit of cinnamon i have to make a double batch or we wont have any leftovers also when i use ground turkey we like the texture more great dish
5,i made it for about souls they all loved it
5,i made this but after reading some of the reviews that thought it was a little bland i decided to use chunky salsa in place of the diced tomatoes and i used turkey sausage instead of the cooked diced turkey it was deliciousi will definitely be making this again and sharing the recipe with my friends
5,this was very very yummy but i did need to add a lot more spice to it i used about tbs of chilly powder and tbs of cayenne pepper and i dont like things to be spice but this made it just spice enough yum yum
5,love this recipe ive made it several times and it always turns out deliciousonly thing i changed was double the spicesadded a tblsp of hot sauce and i also used ckn because thats what i had in the fridgequick and easy recipe
5,i make this dish regularly in the cold weather months love it
5,wow this recipe makes the best just allaround classictasting chili if youre craving a good simpletasting chili this is it the pumpkin gives the chili a nice thickness but doesnt impart any flavor its just good
5,what a wonderful surprise very easy to make and tastes fabulous a nice addition to my glutenfree menu
5,this is a monthly meal for our family i use half black bean half northern i add tsp cinnamon and tbsp brown sugar since peppers are hcrazy expensive when we want to eat it i freeze chopped fresh peppers in the summer
5,fantastic would rate a six if i could so unique to have a chili that doesnt have a red sauce flavor will be a regular
5,this is more than excellent and i wish i could give it more stars
5,one of the best chili recipes i make this every year in the fall and winter everyone i make it for always ask for the recipe
5,my entire family loved this here are the changes i made used a red pepper skipped saute step and put it all in the slow cooker added another can of black beans used large cans of chicken instead of turkey added teaspoon of chipotle chili powder used teaspoons of salt also i had made some corn stock from left over cobs that i had frozen the corn off eugina bones recipe and used that instead of chicken broth
5,i make this with ground beef instead of turkey and it is hearty and comforting

5,i have made this recipe several times now sometimes substituting ground turkey for the beef and it is still excellent i also sometimes add bacon to it to make it a bacon cheeseburger soup
5,awesome here are some changes we did to the recipe c carrotswill do c next time did not peel potatoes replaced velveeta with an oz block of pepper jack shreddedreally gave it a kickserved with hot fresh homemade potato bread
5,excellenti keep the skin on the potatoes instead of velveeta we are not big fans we used pepper jack cheese shredded it really gave this soup a kicki also reduced the salt and used tsp pepper keeper
5,absoultely sensational i love this soup and i am not a big soup eater
5,i got this same recipe years ago and instead of ground beef o have used bacon ham and even venison comes out great every time and i am expected to make it on holidays with my inlaws careful on salt if you use ham or bacon and get rid od grease id you use bacon or ham
5,loved this recipe we actually used chopped chorizo instead of turkey yum yum even my little kids liked it
5,this black bean and pumpkin chili recipe is terrific very fast and simple preparation however i did add tbsp tomato paste can of pinto beans cooked and crumbled bacon i also used basil instead of parsley and oregano only because i ran out defiantly adding this recipe to my recipe book
5,works out well if cooked on stove top as well i have made this with ground turkey when i didnt have any leftover turkey to use because the family loves it it turns out tasty either way
5,this was great substituted out the tomatoes and replaced with more pepper also added more pumpkin it was great everyone loved it
5,delicious and easy i used ground turkey and half the black beans and served it over spaghetti noodles yum
5,i really changed some things in this recipe but plan on trying the original when i have all the ingredients i used extra beans and cubed chicken did not have turkey didnt have yellow pepper so used frozen summer squash diced also out of tomatos so used salsa which made it so thick so used extra broth not done yet buy did taste test and its wonderful and soooo full of flavor the five stars if because i already know the original recipe is great without trying it yet i also sauted the chicken pieces in the olive oil then the onionsand garlic along with the bits of goodies left in the pan wonderfulthank you for the great recipe
5,the pumpkin adds a creamy delicious texture i made this one vegan by omitting the meat and using veggie broth
5,this was so good the pumpkin was perfect as a thickening agent im putting this on my halloween dinner party menu
5,happened across this recipe linked from a blog i was following and decided to whip it up i made some minor adjustments for tasted but mostly followed the recipe everyone who ate it gave it great reviewthe blog that linked it suggested using kielbasa sausage instead of turkey cuts seemed odd and it worked out great i also cut the broth to cups because i wanted it less soupy and it worked well for that also added tsp of cinnamon and tsp of crushed red pepper flakes for some added heat spot on perfectnext time i might try using a ground turkey sausage for meat and maybe add some corn to the mixquick and easy recipe to enjoy have at it
5,very easy and healthy i agree with previous reviews that it needed extra spices i added a lot more chili powder and some cayenne pepper then it was delish
5,this was absolutely delicious i cant wait to make it again cant say enough about it it was greati mostly like regular chili recipes this was a little different will be my new favorite you have to make this deserves more than stars
5,i made this for my family it fit into the weight watcher plan and they all loved it and could not guess the secret ingredient
5,so yummy will make many more times before the weather warms
5,made this recipe this past weekend and absolutely loved it family was a little unsure about the pumpkin in it until they tried itmy boys couldnt get enough
5,this is my all time favorite recipe as soon as the fall temps arrive it is the first thing i make i am on weight watchers and this recipe fits right into my plan full of healthy hearty and yummy ingredients
5,forgot to mention that i use chicken instead of turkey
5,loved it pumpkin gave me less of a problem with stomach acid afterward that i typically have with chili no tums for me
5,my husband and i loved this chili recipe it was hearty and healthy too i used ground turkey in place of the cooked turkey and it was great definitely a keeper
5,when i make chili i brown the meat then add all the spices and let simmer for minit seems like then u can taste the spices betteri used ground turkey and one can of red gold petite diced tomatoes with chilies hot lots more flavor used one can black bleans and one can dark red kidney beans did not add the yellow pepper hubby does not like peppers in his chili thanks for sharing
5,i made this on the stove and my friends and family loved it i made it times in one week loved it
5,i made this last night with a precooked turkey breast from the supermarket deli i made it on top of the stove instead of in the crock pot and let it simmer for about and hour to blend the flavors i had about of a can of pumpkin left over from a coffee cake i had made last weekend and it worked out fine i used lower sodium chicken broth and black beans and it was still salty enough for us i also substituted a can of mild diced tomatoes with chiles for the regular diced tomatoes i noticed one reader said that the recipe turned out too soupy try taking the lid off and cooking it on high a little longer in the crick pot or simmering it with the lid off for a few minutes on top of the stove my husband and son both rated this a the best part is that they never guessed it had canned pumpkin in it
5,made this twice in two weeks once to try and again to serve for company i did add half a can of tomato paste to thicken up but i like my chili thick very tasty
5,neither my husband or i are pumpkin fans but this was excellent will make again for company
5,tremendous i wish there was a choice for stars unusual ingredients make up one delicious chili so good just try it
5,have made this twice now and it is yummy i used a pound of ground turkey breast browned instead of cubed turkey my kids even liked it you dont taste the pumpkin and it makes it more nutritious
5,i took it for a work potluck and didnt tell anyone it had pumpkin in it until they tried it i went home with an empty crockpot i love that its so healthy

5,very good i made this vegetarian by substituting tempeh for the turkey and vegetable broth for the chicken broth i steamed the tempeh and then sautéed it with olive oil and a dash of chili powder then added it to the slow cooker with the other ingredients i will definitely be making this recipe again and again yum
5,i used a roasted chicken it was very good
5,i was a little apprehensive about this one but boy was it tasty i think this will be one of my favorites this fall absolutely delicious
5,excellent chili i was skeptical because the recipe did not call for my usual chili ingredients however it was super i substituted white chicken cubes schwans product for the turkey definitely a keeper and will make again
5,for a little extra kick i added a chopped jalapeno it is so good my husband requested that i make it for him to take deer hunting to share with the gang
5,excellent i doubled the recipe as i had oz can of pumpkin there was enough room in the large crockpot
5,i took it to a potluck untested everyone loved it its a keeper
5,yum for our tastes i omitted the yellow pepper and grilled a couple chicken breasts on the indoor grill to replace the turkey used part of a packet of chili seasoning instead of the spices called for and added a can od whole kernel corn for a bit more sweetness served it with shredded cheddar tortilla chips and sour cream hubby loved it even after i confessed about the pumpkin
5,made this last night the best augratin potatoes i have had follow the recipe as written but omitted the onions
5,phonestly havent made this yet but it looks scrumptious question though approx how thin should thinly sliced potatoes be ¼inch ⅛inch i want these to come out as yummy as they looksoundppthanksp
5,this chili was phenominal it was so easy to make and was so flavorful the only addition i did was to add a minced jalapeno pepper my family loved it i will definitely make it again
5,my husband and i love this chili i really enjoy the sweeter flavor we use ground turkey and sometimes add a half a can more of black beans
5,black beans n pumpkin chilii made this for my husbnd and son i added more chili powder a little onion salt and pepper when i served it i put sredded cheddar cheese on top and ate it with ritz crackers for a spooon i rate it delicious and there was no detection of pumpkin very nutricious
5,delicious i substitute extra cans rinsed drained black beans for the turkey as we generally prefer the beans to the turkey crush up some tortilla chips on top and add a sprinkle of cheddaryum
5,i really liked this recipe but i added more beans and i used kidney beans because i was out of black beans
5,for a meat free spice to taste omit the meat subsitute the meat and or broth as you would with your favorite wah la
5,everyone in my house thought this was extremely tasty amp had seconds i added red chili flakes for some heat amp used beef broth because i was out of chicken the pumpkin makes its thick amp rich deelish
5,i used a can of diced tomatoes w green chilies instead of plain diced tomatoes to add more flavor everyone loved it
5,absolutely love thisim not a huge chili person but this is soooooo goodcouldnt get enough of iti didnt use the peppers and used mild rotel for the canned tom and ground turkeydelicious served it a party everyone loved it and you would never know their is pumpkin in it
5,amazing i added an extra teaspoon of chili powder and decreased chicken broth by cup my husband daughter and just loved it
5,this chili is fantastic my six year old gobbles it up
5,excellent healthy chili thanks just printed it out to give to my daughter
5,i used freshly cooked mashed butternut squash in mine and put quite a bit extra in delicious you dont taste the pumpkin
5,a really nice uncomplicated recipe i par boiled my potatos layered them with a little cheese and sauce in between each layer used just russet potatoes and i got layers also added a little minced garlic to the milk mixture very good used mexican cheese blend
5,followed the recipe and it turned out delicious i used food processor to slice potatoes as was suggested i did sprinkle some paprika on before baking because i think its fun and pretty next time i plan to decrease salt to teaspoon it turned out perfect
5,recipe worked well i used whole milk gouda and russet potatoes season to taste i had to cook it for over an hour
5,i added small chopped onions and about cups of sharp cheese even though my potatoes were very thinly sliced it took about hours to cook but when i showed up at my neighbors cookout everyone loved my dish
5,this recipe is a good starting point but i made modifications one immediate one on my second try in order to make it a really good dish ollii skipped the butter the second time instead bringing the milk to a simmer and adding the flour to thicken it when i used the butter i got quite a bit of excess grease sitting in the corners of the pan i know butter is a key component of a béchamel sauce which is the base of this dish but youre adding enough cheese that you dont need the richness butter provides and if it cooks out and forms a layer of grease its not adding to the recipe anywaylili tsp of black pepper is an insultingly small amount for a recipe this large if you use that little pepper in your cooking please never invite me to dinner i know the recipe says additional pepper optional but it really isnt this recipe makes servings th of a teaspoon per serving might as well be nothingliol
5,i followed the recipe using whole milk and extra sharp cheddar cheese but made additions i added a cup of parmesan cheese and teaspoon of dijon mustard came out amazing will absolutely make this again
5,can i possibly give this more than stars even my super picky year old devoured it thank you seems incredibly inadequate
5,excellent dish delicious it got lots of compliments at the solstice potluck
5,we lovingly call these potatoes old rotten potatoes au gratin potatoes this particular recipe is very similar to the way my wife makes it we made this recipe and the church potluck group loved it
5,these are great i omitted the onion because no one in my family likes the physical onion but i did add a few teaspoons of onion powder garlic powder and some fresh parsley to my sauce mixture also used cheddar and mozzarella cheese
5,i have made this recipe several times and it is the best au gratin potato dish ive ever eaten i recycled the leftovers into a potato cheese soup by adding a bit more milk or chicken broth excellent taste and texture
5,i am making this recipe i am years old i tell my wife to always remember were years old because she said that is an old recipe no it is a basic recipe most year olds never made it very good recipe thanks
5,great recipe i cooked it minutes longer but other then that it was great my fussy husband loved it
5,delicious my kids are picky eaters and loved them too made the recipe with no changes or substitutes will be making again
5,my family enjoyed the recipe this was a good basic recipe and worth keeping a great template or just fine as is i added the salt after i melted the cheese just because i didnt have a full cup of cheddar and made up the difference with processed cheese which tends to be saltier in fairness the recipe states after you uncover the potatoes that the cooking time will be minutes or longer if your potatoes arent tender in my experience it does usually ends up taking about two hours is it my oven the thickness of the potatoes or the type of potato who knows what i know is that like the recipe and i would make this again
5,this soup is so easy and my family loves it my year old rarely eats leftovers but has eaten this one times since the first night i made it
5,this is one of my goto soups we make a double batch and freeze the left overs makes a good makeahead meal love it
5,i made this soup recently for a family gathering and everybody loved it i received lots of compliments and recipe requests i doubled the recipe and used lean hamburger velveeta made with milk milk and light sour cream very tasty
5,simple and delicious most ingredients i normally have ive made this before with sliced and shredded cheesewhatever i had in the fridge and it came out great
5,one of the best soups ive eaten im sure i will make it often
5,my newest favorite soup just gotta be careful when making the rue butter with flour if you overcook it the recipe wont turn out right like others said it wasnt hard to make at all helps to use the food processor for the veggies for quicker preperations
5,delicious i will continue to make this soup
5,very tasty soup and my kids and husband really liked it
5,this was very good i will use a no salt broth next time though
5,my year old daughter and i found this recipe while looking up what to make out of the ordinary with hamburger meat she did most of it with me doing the cutting and it was amazing probably the best soup ive ever made and we were both hesitant at first before we started cooking it we browned the meat with a half can of diced green peppers for a mild kick and used baby red potatoes and i cannot wait to have leftovers again tonight we also made some homemade bread and stuffed a slice in each bowl and oh man it was wonderful
5,i questioned some of the ingredients but it was fantastic should be called a cheeseburger potato soup tasted like i was eating a baked potato with a cheeseburger on top the soup also looked like queso dip which made my kids excited to eat it
5,sounds fab
5,i made this as a vegetarian dish with yves meatless ground which is better than the frozen kind and usually around for a package that equals pound of ground beef like others i also used cheddar in place of the velveeta and since the meatless ground beef adds texture but not a lot of flavor i also added imitation bacon bits to add a little meat flavor it came out delicious with a wonderful texture i will certainly be making this again
5,this was easy to make and very tasty i used pound of lean hamburger skim milk and all the rest of the ingredients as listed it was yummy and my hubby says it is a keeper
5,these are absolutely delish i made a few slight changes the second time and since even betterswitched out the milk with heavy whipping cream and used cups of cheese instead and baked uncovered for minutes to get the top crispier everyone asks me for this recipe now
5,great flavorwatch the salt i found it to be too much
5,very tasty i used bits of several different cheeses and reduced the salt cooking a hour
5,i just made these for the first time today i mixed part sharp cheddar and a mexican mix thats what i had very good
5,i have made this twice the first time i followed the rescipe but t and to the t and although very delicious my husband and i thought we would add more cheese so stay tuned will let everyone know how they turned out
5,as another reviewer stated first time followed the recipe to the letter it turned out ok was just a little too bland for our taste tweaked this time with a little more seasoning and a tad more cheese oh and i topped with breadcrumbs after uncovering
5,i like au gratin potatoes and was raised on the betty crocker boxed ones problem is my wife hates the consistency of boxed ones made these yesterday and we both loved them simple and easy to make we had the leftovers with tonights dinner and may even have tasted better rewarmed definitely keeping this recipe
5,the best potato gratin i have ever made or tasted only added fresh grated garlic plus extra black pepper sea salt and fresh thyme i even used part semi skimmed milk part skimmed milk and the roux still cooked up lovely and thick firm texture and cuts well hot or cold freezes well too
5,i tried this recipe easy and the best my husband and i loved it so much
5,my husband and i both loved this recipe easy to put together turned out perfectly well use it again and again i wish i could give it more than stars to make up for the person earlier this month who gave it only without making it and in spite of saying it sounded delicious due to not being able to eat cheese and apparently not understanding what gratin means
5,sooooo good delicious and simple to put together it is also easy to experiment with i added frenchs fried onions to the top for the last minutes of baking honestly that one star review made me lol and want to try out this recipe if i couldnt eat these amazing potatoes i would be disappointed too
5,literally exactly like my grandma used to make absolutely delish
5,used a tablespoon of dried onion flakes instead of a half cup onion to accommodate my husbands preferences and added a healthy sprinkle of cayenne was worried it would be salty but it was not next time i may opt for salt substitute or a blend
5,my husband loves this recipe and he cant get enough of it im putting it in the fav recipe box
5,this is an amazing recipe i tweaked it a little i omitted the onions and used onion powder replaced the milk with heavy cream and used vermont cheddar and sharp cheddar and slices of pepper jack cheese someone suggested that i partially cook the potatoes first so after i sliced them i microwaved them for minutes i have never had such delicious augratin potatoes this is a keeper
5,absolutely delicious this one is definitely going to see some regular action with me i would recommend sprinkling some mozzarella over the top when you take the top off before the last mins of baking gives its a lovely stringy chewy cheesy crust
5,i love au gratin potatoes this recipe is scrumptious i added a bit more cheese then topped it was little more cheese after i took the cover off this one is definitely a keeper
5,on easter i followed the recipe exactly except adding some cayenne pepper a family must and everyone even my really picky son loved it a perfect side dish for ham very easy to make since the russet potato slices are thin i didnt peel them which added nutrition and flavor and it wasnt noticeable the oven temp and cooking time were exactly right the potatoes were tender but not mushy unanimous decision to make it an easter tradition thanks taste of home ill check back with you again
5,this was the best recipe we have found in years your sauce was deeeelish i didnt have any milk so i used heavy whipping cream instead thank you for sharing
5,great recipe made the recipe exactly as written except i used whole milk they were great with my ham for easter this recipe is a keeper
5,this was perfect for us and exactly what i was looking for easter i doubled for a x pan used cheddarjack shredded cheese family preference used cups fat free milk and one cup half and half so good
5,the family and neighbors loved this
5,used
5,sorry i mistakenly submitted my review anyhow i sautéed the onions in the melted butter added the flour and cooked a few minutes to cook out the flour heated cups milk
5,excellent classic dish i double the sauce with cups of shredded sharp cheddar cheese for to medium potatoes i bake at for hour for more browning on top
5,i would love to get the ingredients for people or more
5,i use the sauce in this recipe for either potatoes or macaroni its very reliable i usually double the recipe if im cooking for my family of six a nice touch is to sautee chopped onion in the butter at the beginning and then continue as instructed with the onion included in the sauce
5,this recipe is easy
5,i doubled the recipe and tripled the cheese replaced the with whole milk also added a little garlic powder and paprika delicious
5,i love this recipe after i made the sauce i realized that i didnt have enough so i made half of the recipe
5,this recipe is so easy and delicious i like it because it doesnt have mustard in the recipe i have made this twice and delicious every time also i sliced the onions thin once and diced them the other time both times delicious
5,i have found my goto au gratins this recipe is easy and cheesy used a blend of regular and sharp cheddar havent used the onion to date as i usually save that for scalloped potatoes freezes well just bake at from frozen covered in a prepared pan with a splash of milk for about an hour
5,i loved this recipe the first time i made it i found that if i stack up the potatoes and onions in my x pyrex dish and pour the cheesy rue over them to make it even better the second time i made it however using this method pouring a drizzle of milk on top before covering keeps the whole dish very creamy family and friends always rave about it
5,tasty i made this in my ninja foodie to save time just had a little extra milk for the pressure cooker
5,by far the best au gratin recipe ive ever used
5,made this tonight awesome i had some left over velveeta cheese from the super bowl rotel dip so i used oz of that for e cheese and topped it with colby jack also added some garlic powder in with the salt and pepper my wife said it was the best she ever had
5,tweeked this by adding mexican cheese mix and smoked paprikaawesome
5,this is a great recipe that can be tweaked for your personal taste i have altered the cheeses and generally add paprika on top
5,tasty it was easy to make make sure to rinse the potatoes i can see adding things in it like mushrooms or peas etc
5,great recipe only modification i made was to use cups of cheese instead and sprinkle some on top for the last or so minutes of baking who doesnt love a cheesy baked crust next time ill use a stronger tasting cheese too like a gruyere or at least sharp cheddar the regular cheddar didntdidnt have a cheesy enough taste
5,fantastic recipe i had some potatoes i needed to use up so ended up increasing the amounts of everything but salt by half i also didnt have shredded cheddar on hand so i used mozzarella and american and used whole milk instead of i cant wait to make this again
5,these are delicious scalloped potatoesi used evaporated milk instead of it gives them a richer flavor
5,easy quick and amazing the family ate them all up my daughter is always asking for augratin potatoes and since we stopped cooking from a box this is the first recipe i tried and its a keeper
5,a favorite of mine and my boyfriend i add about six strips of bacon chopped and a can of sweet corn it gives it a smoky summer feel
5,excellent and easy recipe i ended up with about cups sliced potatoes cut the salt to tsp and used cups cheese saucetopotato ratio was perfect but i did have to bake mine an extra half hour thanks for the great recipewill be adding this to my rotation
5,after having read most of the reviews i put the sliced potatoes in cold water and boiled them for minutes only i then added about half a cup of gruyere cheese and half a teaspoon of smoked paprika to the sauce and poured it over the warm potatoes and baked it according to the recipeit was amazing
5,made this multiple times this is a simple good recipe i use extra sharp cheese and grate extra to sprinkle on top during the last minutes of cooking
5,oh my goodness this recipedish was so good it became an instant favorite in our house and i will make it again
5,delicious i used mediumlarge potatoes doubled the saucecheese ingredients and used a x baking dish i omitted the onion not by choice but because i simply forgot to put them in still these potatoes were wonderful i baked them about an hour and fifteen minutes covered and then continued to bake another thirty minutes uncovered they came out perfect the potatoes were tender and covered in the cheesy sauce perfect accompaniment to the glazed ham we had with it will keep this recipe handy anytime i need a potato side dish
5,this was so delicious next time i make it i will double the recipe so that we have more leftovers i made it in the early afternoon and left it warming on the stove my boyfriend helped himself to a little bit all day so we only had bowls leftover after dinner have already made this twice and will definitely make again my boyfriend put some ketchup on his to make it taste more like a cheeseburger
5,this a winner only change i made was to dice potatoes a little smaller at familys request
5,super i added lb chopped bacon to mine have some xtra chicken broth in case you want it more soupy great recipewill make many times over
5,i made this for a church supper and everyone thought it was great i used frozen hash brown potatoes the rue i made in the microwave in a large bowl and added the milk to that and melted the cheese before adding it to the soup pot
5,my husband loved this soup he said it was a keeper for sure i did use velveeta instead of regular
5,made it just as written to extend the leftovers i baked two potatoes unpeeled in the microwave chopped them and green pepper and added them i topped it with a couple slices cooked bacon
5,i need to make this again soon the family loved it
5,excellent i made this for the super bowl one time and my family loved it i ended up leaving the salt and pepper out completely so everyone could add it to their taste and it still tasted amazing without it
5,never made it ha ha on you
5,this was great my family loved it
5,this is creamy and just like at the restaurant i think i will cook the carrots celery and onion in some broth next time though it seemed dry in the pan and when i served the soup the celery was still a little crisp otherwise fantastic easy to follow directions and very tasty
5,this has been my daughters favorite soup recipe since she was in st grade she is now and still ask me to make it for her
5,i recall preparing this recipe when it was featured in taste of home and it was delicious id used lb ground beef cup sliced carrots cups potatoes peeled and cut in chunks rather than cubed i used cups cheddar cheese cups milk or half and half cream amp used cup ranch dressing instead of sour cream i found that the adjustments worked out for me perhaps dicing the potatoes is betterid chunked them instead at any rate i really liked this recipe if i dont have basil available ive used italian seasoning instead i really enjoy the blend of italian seasoning anyway and have turned to it when i season dishes calling for oregano or basildelowenstein
5,the first soup i make every fall when it finally gets cool
5,easy to make and yummy

5,i have made this many times and we love it it takes some time to prepare but it is worth it
5,made this for supper tonight everyone loved it definitely making again for those concerned about the sodium content you can use homemade chicken brothuse cheddar cheese instead of velveeta and unsalted butter
5,i made this last night for dinner and used red potatoes also used herbox chicken broth in place of regular chicken broth did not have celery in the house so just omitted that yum
5,wow this soup is amazing
5,this is often requested by family and at our annual soup event at church
5,my picky year old just cleaned her bowl its a keeper
5,this is an excellent soup the only changes i made was fresh celery in place of the seeds amp sharp cheese in place of velveeta my family loved it thank you coleen
5,saving this one my moto is everything is better with bacon and cheddar definitely not a fan of velveeta so i will be switching the cheese out and using fresh celery rather than the celery seed because that has a tendency to be overpowering even with a tsp but everything else will remain the same we love fresh hot soups in the winter months and i am always looking for something different than the usual suspects
5,this is such a comforting soup i added about cup of leeks and substituted the velveeta with sharp white cheddar cheese everything else was kept as is delicious
5,this is amazing i replaced the velveeta with some cheddar and i added some cream and it tastes phenomenal definitely will make again my friends loved it
5,best potato soup i have ever made my all time favorite
5,my family loves potato soup and has been making it for decades this recipe is similar to how we make ours with the exception of lots of chopped onion fresh celery and some chopped fresh spinach no cheese but i always add some chicken base and often a sprinkle of bouillon powder im perplexed how so many soup recipes leave those two flavorings out maybe because i use homemade bone broth that its needed but it turns a mediocre soup into fantastic
5,re bruschetta chickenthis is the first time i tried making something for company that i had never made before well it was just wonderful i served it with smashed potatoes string beans amp a salad everyone expressed how delicious it was thank you taste of home for a great low cost company dinner keep them comingretired nana
5,wow
5,very good
5,this a wonderful dish and very flavorful
5,absolutely outstanding its all i could think about today
5,this was so much more flavorful than most potato soups i have tried in fact i do not usually bother ordering or making potato soup as it is usually pasty and bland i made as written except used only tsp celery seeds my husband enjoyed it and is looking forward to leftover soup this weekend thanks for new take on potato soup
5,i am awful at cooking yet i found this recipe easy despite my challenges as a chef loved the flavor so did my family i did use the bacon grease that came out the bacon to sauté the onions then add the rest of the veggies
5,fabulous soup my husband and yearold grandson request this soup often the only changes i make is to use better than bouillon chicken flavor mixed with water rather than broth and mexican velveeta cheese a friend said she combined sweet potatoes and white potatoes in her soup and loved it
5,this recipe is almost the same as one i have been using however i use a combination of cream cheese and pepperjack cheese i add fresh diced celery and use celery salt instead of seed the person who said the celery seed was to strong must have used the wrong measurement or celery powder great recipe
5,this really is the best potato soup ever all i changed was adding more carrots diced
5,best soup i made a batch and my husband who hates soup even loved it his only recommendation was next time a double batch
5,this is really good i sautéd the carrots and onions in a bit of the bacon grease for more flavor i used a bit celery salt and yukon gold potatoes since thats what i had i used a very small amount of velveeta for its creaminess and for the rest i used aged cheddar cheese
5,my wife and think this is the best soup in my repertoire we substituted bacon with mutton mild cheddar is the closest i could find its not rich yet it feels smooth and creamy
5,easy and delicious i love this soup because it is great on its own or if you add more to it ive made it with broccoli and cauliflower we like to have grilled cheese sandwiches or extra bacon with our soup
5,my alltime favorite soup
5,this is the best potato soup recipe i have ever made it was a hit with the family
5,wonderful soup i used half and half instead of milk and added a dash or two of worcestershire sauce also a can of cream of corn
5,this soup is pretty easy and very delicious i used whole milk since we like our potato soup a little thicker i also heeded the advice of other commenters and left out the celery seed and use celery salt in place of regular salt i think i might just add celery to the veggies next time to up the flavor
5,turned out great my husband loved it and i tweaked it a bitsauteed the onions and carrots in the bacon grease for added flavor increased the amount of veggies by and the broth by used half and half instead of milk used minced celery had no celery seed and trying to keep sodium low added a tsp garlic powder and lastly added c mozzarella to tone down the velveeta twang it was so creamy with soft chunks of potato exceptional flavor may try without bacon or half and half next time due to heart health issues any suggestions to replace the bacon and it made enough for multiple additional meals which i plan to take the advice from others for various addons thanks for the recipe
5,i didnt have any celery seed to use and i swapped out velveeta for freshlygrated sharp cheddar and mozzarella put a dash of white wine in only used strips of bacon instead of and used about a half cup of heavy cream and cups of milk but other than that i followed the recipe it turned out absolutely delicious
5,love this recipe i make it often as its become my new comfort food the only tweaks i made to it are no carrots they make the soup too sweet cheese i prefer using real cheese like medium cheddar or colby rather than the velveeta it melts fast if you shred it on occasion ill use or less of the velveeta and substitute the other half with actual cheddar or colby real cheese will always taste better on occasion ill use broccoli instead of potatoes viola you have broccoli cheese soup
5,this is mostly my favorite recipe in the entire world i made an account just to rate it but i need to know what on gods green earth made you use velveeta instead of just normal cheese
5,with the cooler air coming in our son was asking for soup this recipe did not disappoint it hit the spot very easy to make with great flavor
5,very easy and delicious my family fought over the small amount of leftovers the next day
5,best potato soap
5,this is so good my husband and i both say it is the best soup i have ever made and i made no changes to the recipe
5,i was a bit nervous to make this soup because of the simple ingredients and simplicity of making it im sure glad it took the chance because my family and i loved it definitely a hit and will absolutely make this again if youre not sure about this souptake that chance it will be worth it
5,excellent soup after potatoes were cooked i mashed them a little before adding the cheese used a tex mex mix and some mozzarella i had some left over peas and corn half a cup through them in at the end very good love this soup
5,this is such a delicious soup its hearty and a crowd pleaser i also swap out the velvets for shredded cheddar or a mix shredded cheese and use some heavy cream in place for some of the milk
5,i cant believe anyone would think that tsp of celery seed would have an overpowering awful taste in a big pot of soup i thought the soup tasted fine and could not taste the celery seed
5,love potatoeswill try to get it made at home or will try it at a good restaurantlovelyyummy
5,giant thumbs up made this for super bowl sunday and it was a huge hit changed the recipe a bit to make more than the recipe made and it was awesome definitely a redo recipe i used about cups of potato cubes and made more cream sauce using cups of milk and tablespoons of flour i am not a big soup person but this will show up on my table many more times
5,easy to make and delicious definitely a keeper
5,omg simply amazing i used cups heavy creamy little milk andbami kicked it up a notch ty very good will tell every one
5,i have made this soup three times and it is so tasty have gotten many compliments the first two times i used half and half instead of milk delicious both ways the bacon really adds flavor
5,this is absolutely fabuloso followed recipe as written yummm
5,i made this the other night it is so good i highly recommend it even my husband loved it i use half and half instead of milk makes it more creamy i just followed the recipe
5,this is delicious and incredibly easy definitely adding this to the rotation followed the recipe exactly except we didnt have any celery seed so i omitted that still turned out fab
5,wow just delicious used cheddar instead of velveeta added a dash or two of worcestershire sauce and some garlic powder cooked the onion in the bacon grease next time will add a can of cream of corn
5,this soup is amazing and super easy i suggest preppingcutting everything first and then begin the cooking i made it my own by using stalks of fresh celery instead of celery seed adding some butter at the end using fresh sharp cheddar instead of velveeta added fresh garlic and added the onion to the cooking bacon about minutes in cooking for a while longer then draining to really add a deep flavor i also sprinkled with paprika at the end amazing
5,this was a delicious and satisfying soup the only thing i did differently was to thicken it with potato flakes instead of flour i think you could use whatever cheese your family likes to eat and it would be just as great its a keeper
5,love this soup its fabulous with bacon or ham i used cheddar instead of velvets
5,id made this recipe and the only ingredient not used were the green onions everything else was kept as recipe directed
5,i just finished making this soup my husband and i give it a thumbs up will try it out at work
5,my family is still talking about this soup and i made it last week
5,this is a nice hearty soup for a cold winter night my husband isnt a huge soup fan and he went for seconds i did change it up a bit because i wont use processed cheese i made the rue in a saucepan instead of small skillet and then added the milk to it i then added about cup of shredded cheddar cheese to the milk mixture and whisked it in so there where no lumps then i added that to the beef and potato mixture in the qt saucepan i mixed everything together and then added another cup of shredded cheddar cheese i also added tbsp of dijon mustard to give it more of a burger feel i also used reduced sodium broth and didnt add the added salt at the end of the recipe in order to keep sodium to a minimum
5,great soup restraunt at home used it and did give out the recipe said it came from taste of home
5,this is one of the first recipes i made from taste of home my family loves it it is easy to double using a large stock pot since everyone went back for seconds a little time consuming in the preparations but it is well worth it leftovers no way
5,delicious soup my husband and grandson lived every last drop served it with cornbread it is a new family favorite
5,super its degrees today i knew soup would be perfect this was my first try and it was great thanks for such simple easy to follow instructions and a great recipe loved it
5,i mixed half cheddar and half velveeta i didnt have enough velveeta on hand soup turned out delicious and i now get requests from the family to make it again and again
5,i use slices bacon in place of butter saute my onion in it then sprinkle the flour over it cook slightly then gradually add milk and stir and add all ing use leftover baked potato or microwave them dont usually have velveeta so i use sharp cheddar or a mix of what i have no carrot celery or herbs or sour cream add a dash of worcheshire sauce set aside some cooked ground beef from another recipe and it comes together very quickly love this soup
5,this is my most favorite soup ever just the way it is
5,mmmmgood i did add an extra lb hamburger i didnt even try it with the sour cream because it was so good already also it just gets tastier as leftovers thank you for a very tasty soup during this very long very cold winter
5,what a great soup printing up copies for friends make it per recipe and tweek to your taste easy to work with
5,absolutely delicious the only changes i made is that i didnt add celery i just dont like celery so i dont add it to anything and i used real shredded cheddar cheese instead of the processed stuff which is much better it probably also made a difference that my broth was homemade yummy
5,this is one of our favorites i use beef stock instead of chicken for a meatier flavor but other than that no real changes and as a bonus it freezes well so i can make a double batch and freeze it in single serve containers for lunches or quick dinners
5,this was delicious i did make a few changes i used lb ground beef pound ground italian sausage and i also threw in jar of real bacon bits and added liquid smoke for even more flavor i used cups of ny sharp cheddar instead of velveeta i also used garden vegetable broth instead of chicken broth since someone i was cooking for is allergic to chicken very flavorful will definitely make again
5,i have made many versions of potato soup and this one is truly one of the best ever this will definitely be on my winter soup list to make on a regular basis i think it would also be great with leftover baked ham instead of bacon
5,greattry adding a tad tsp fresh dilladds an additional depth
5,just as good as restaurant potato soup i did not have any parsley so omitted and no celery seed so added celery salt after cooking on stove used my pressure cooker simmer for hour it was the best i did only use half the amount of velveeta however i thought it might me to cheesy so that was perfect
5,absolutely delicious i definitely recommend doubling the recipe if you are making this for a family so you can enjoy leftovers the few changes i made i used sargento sharp cheddar cheese instead of processed there was no graininess in the texture which sometimes can happen with preshredded cheese i am not an expert cook by any means but i was a little thrown off by the milkflour mixture i am used to making a roux so that is what i did instead to the roux i added half and half instead of milk and the cheese i then poured this mixture into the pot with the veggiesbroth i didnt think this recipe needed any salt so i didnt add any i topped each bowl with shredded cheese a dollop of sour cream and some green onions so so good
5,absolutely perfect ive made this countless times and it is always a hit especially on cold winter nights it doesnt take that long to make it and there are a few hacks to making it even quicker ive used bacon pieces and frozen cubed potatoes before and it still turned out good
5,delicious i cut the recipe in half for the two of us and it was the perfect amount for our evening meal along with a warm bun i did use sharp cheddar just as a preference
5,nothing but praise from my guests definitely a recipe that you need to double if you want any leftovers for yourself
5,awesome soup we love time
5,very good potato soup husband kept saying this is so good glad i doubled the recipe will print this one
5,good potato soup i typically do not prefer cheesy soups but the cheese was barely noticeable
5,so good my husband and daughter love this we like to add a few more potatoes and water yum
5,the name says it all we had a luncheon at our house and of the people said the soup was delicious one of the men asked me to give his wife the recipe
5,this was very very good made it just as recipe stated will definitely save thank you for sharing
5,a lngtime family favorite ive made this many times with and without the bacon its great both ways nothing better on a cold winter day my husband says hed pay for this soup
5,cooked slices of bacon disappears at my house so i sauteed double the onions and carrots in bacon grease added oz of chicken broth doubled spices and potatoes kept the milk flour and velveeta as called in recipe sprinkled bacon bits in each bowl amazing
5,i have yet to taste this creation but im giving it stars nevertheless i made a couple of modifications i added all the bacon grease from the pound of bacon i cooked and crumbled i also added a packet of ranch seasoning this makes my potato salad do delicious so thought id try it im also adding some fresh parsley at the end and adding sharp cheddar cheese instead of the velveeta this is for a soup off at school tomorrow i cant wait to see if its one of the winners
5,awesome made no changes except added bacon at the end my husband raved about it almost every bite next time i will double it so we have leftovers this one is a keeper
5,made this for my family and they all loved it i personally would add more potatoes and slightly more seasoning but other than that this recipe is simple but delicious my family said it was better than logans a restaurant
5,never was happy with other recipes and then my daughter came across this one and told me to try it it will be the only one i ever use again
5,delicious i doubled the recipe and served in sour dough bowls easy and perfect for an autumn lunch
5,great flavor once i gathered everything this came together really quickly i would definitely make this for company i might try to swap out the velveeta for a white cheddar but as is its very good
5,this was awesome very easy and delicious we would double the recipe if we had our boys home from college
5,just had this tonight this is one of the best potato soups ive ever had very filling and can also freeze for later a real keeper
5,this is a very good recipe i have a similar recipe but without the bacon and it is just as good it didnt get as thick as i had assumed it would not sure what happened i even added more like t flour hmmmm
5,yummy soup and easy to make i have made this twice in the last week i just used grated cheddar cheese and i did not have any green onions otherwise i made it just as it says
5,just prepared this tonight for the first time and it did not disappoint only change was to use whole milk and shredded mild colby instead of velveeta this soup was wonderful on a very cold ohio night being someone who loves potato soup i have to say this is one of the very best potato soup recipes and one i will be making over and over again
5,made it this evening tastes very good shared with neighbors and they wanted recipe very filling

5,the only thing i changed was i used shredded cheddar cheese instead of the velveeta cheese turned out great
5,best ever
5,we loved this recipe the only thing we added was garlic both of my picky sons ate it all
5,delicious i do a few things different when i make it after frying the bacon i remove it with a slotted spoon and sauté the onion and a few cloves of garlic for a few minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients i also left out the celery seed and added some garlic powder instead my husband and i love garlic
5,i used heavy cream in place of milk i also added cubed hard boiled eggs after the potatoes were cooked thats how we pennsylvania german people make it im thinking a nonprocessed cheese might be better
5,this was an ausume soup
5,simply amazing
5,awesome soup thumbs up stars
5,this was really good super cheesy though kinda tasted like au gratin potatoes my husband loves velveeta so he gobbled it up i put in diced ham instead of bacon because its what i had on hand will definitely make it again
5,this is a very easily assembled soup and its delicious i put a little less bacon and little less velveeta but it was still wonderful
5,wonderful soup creamy and delicious i used shredded texmex cheese instead of velveeta for a bit of kick and added garlic powder with the spices its a keeper
5,i added a bit more carrot and used kraft cheddar cheese blend with philadelphia cream cheese in it it was very very good and extremely simple i also used fresh parsley it was a hit with all my family my grandma and my stepmom both asked for my recipe
5,outstanding recipe i just made this for dinner we loved it and agree that it is a keeper i did not dice the bacon i cooked it until crisp i crumbled half of it and added to the pot with the potatoes and broth we used the remaining to crumble into our bowls i sauted the onions and carrots in about a tbs of bacon drippings before i added the potatoes and broth i used celery seed because i did not have fresh celery but i plan to use fresh celery next time also to increase volume used cups and milk and a little more than tbs flour my husband likes his soup a little thick this recipe is very versatile i am already planning when i can make this again and maybe use ham instead of bacon another great recipe for my collection
5,simple and quick to make of course more bacon is always better im going to try half beef broth half chicken broth next time
5,this recipe is so good it is very easy to make i added more bacon and cheese and it was more of a cheese soup rather than more of a potato soup excellent seriously is the best potato soup ever
5,this was delicious i added some of the bacon grease to the initial broth and used an oz bag of shredded sharp cheddar for the cheese i excluded the carrot and green onions will definitely make this again
5,wow very tasty but i always very carefull with velveeta so i put less amount of it because i am always afraid to get very cheesy
5,yes best ever potato soup
5,this is the best potato soup i have ever had and a staple recipe for me
5,this is the best potato soup ever a family favorite
5,too easytoo deliciousto die for the next go round id like to add brocolli i lowered the fat content by using skim milk i even sprinkled some shredded provolone and chedder total comfort food thank you coleen morrissey
5,i tweeked this recipe a little bit i doubled it for starters i also used stalks of fresh celery and sauteed the celery onions and carrots in bacon drippings in the stew pot i also used oz of velveeta and oz of sharp cheddar cheese of course i also doubled the bacon this recipe was a hit i shared with a family of four single dad and three picky eating kidsthey devoured it i will hands down make this again we ate it with rhodes frozen rolls mmmmmm
5,i have been making this recipe for years its our favorite soup comes together in no time and is just wonderful i double the veggies and also add celery to it yummo
5,i have been making this recipe forever and we all love it i also add some chopped celery and a tad of minced garlic as well great hearty soup
5,i added hot sausage meatballs too
5,yum just made this soup using frozen hashbrowns and it turned out delicious i used a little less bacon around cups or more frozen hashbrowns and shredded cheddar cheese instead of velveta i used fatfree milk and added a touch extra salt after tasting it when it was done didnt have fresh onions on hand so used tbsp hydrated onion this will be on my list of great soups for fall
5,it really is the best i added some johnsonville hot italian sausages instead of the bacontasted just like the potato soup at the olive garden
5,i made this soup tonight for my family i used pkg shredded cheese instead of velveeta and took the bacon out of pan after i cooked it and served it on top of soup as a garnish everyone loved it this is a keeper thank you for the receipe
5,this really is the best potato soup ever everyone who i have shared it with loves it i make it several times during the winter i wont even ever try another potato soup recipe now
5,i made this soup tonight and i would defiantly make it again it was super easy i didnt grate my carrots i just sliced them real small and it worked just fine sharing this with all of my friends
5,excellent recipe ive tried several other potato soup recipes which we like but both my sons said this one was the best and asked me to make again my husband liked it as well but thought i should reduce the salt a little bit
5,this is a delicious potato soup if you like clam chowderadding clams to this would be delicious as well ive made this soup several times very good
5,made this soup today since hubby is under the weather this soup was excellent i did make a few changes first i doubled the recipe to make a nice size pot i omitted the celery seed as dh does not like it but i minced a small rib of celery and cooked it with the potatoes and other veggies instead of doubling the parsley flakes i added tbsp dried parsley flakes and tbsp dried minced chives i added equal amounts of melted margarine with the flour in a separate pot then added the milk and cheese to make a cheese sauce once that was all thickened and cheesy i added it to the potatoveggie mixture it was great and i will make it again
5,this is delicious and easy to make potato soup i didnt have celery seed so i chopped up a couple stalks of celery i also added minced garlic which i put in almost everything i cook
5,wow bestever is an understatement i researched many different recipes before finding this one and i will look no more i made some changes but am sure the original recipe is just as good i reserved a few tablespoons of bacon grease and sauteed finely chopped onion garlic and three celery stalks until tender i used reduced sodium broth and bacon and increased amount of salt to rounded tsp i also reserved some of the bacon for garnish with shredded cheese i used can evaporated milk and halfhalf to equal cups and then used cup milk to equal the cups recipe calls for i purchased cream of potato in case i needed to thicken but no thickening needed it was so creamy and literally hugged the spoon i think the evaporated milk helped next time i will add another cup of potatoes thanks so much for the recipe
5,served this at my st paddys theme dinner and it was very good
5,i make a batch of soup every week and this is quickly got worked into the rotation its very easy amp very good i follow the directions exactly and i always double it everyone loves this soup
5,very good kids inhaled it
5,very good recipe i used a bag of diced potatoes to cut down on prep time i didnt have any celery seed so left it out it was still great
5,ive scoured the internet looking for the perfect potato soup recipe this is it very good flavor and consistency ill definitely make this recipe again and again
5,my family loves this best potato soup ever
5,delicious perfect for those sick rainy days will make again soon
5,is a very tasty moist banana bread
5,i make this bread at least once a week sometimes more my son cant have dairy or gluten so this is perfect i will sometimes add dairyfree chocolate chips i also dont always make it into loaves it bakes great in a x pan and the extra batter i use for muffins
5,ive been baking this every week since finding the recipe and everyone ive given it to has raved i modified it a little in that i add tsp baking powder tsp cinnamon and a pinch of cloves i use an allinone gf product which tends to yield a product which is a bit too heavy and doesnt rise as well as with regular wheat flour the tsp of baking powder makes a big difference and the small amounts of spices bring out the richness of flavor
5,i love its
5,made this for the first time today followed the recipe exactly delicious moist perfect i will definitely make it again
5,this is my first review on here i loved this gluten free bread for the past year ive been reading recipes on here and reading comments from reviewers on recipes id like to try i find the comments invaluable i used very ripe medium to large bananas and i replaced the oil in this recipe with cup butter added cinnamon and allspice doubled the vanilla extract i didnt have applesauce on hand but did have apple butter like another reviewer had suggested i used one cup namaste and cup bob red mill to gluten free flours the batter was thin enough to pour into my bread pans and it baked perfectly at minutes for me there is no way you could tell this is gluten free i like this better than regular banana bread which ive found can be dry at times not this one
5,pthis gluten free banana bread was fantastic i used the cup for cup king arthur flour i added cinnamon nutmeg and allspice i didnt have any walnuts but i did have chopped pecans and they were wonderful it came out moist and flavorful my gluten tolerant family loves this bread tooppp
5,i made this yesterday and loved it thanksaleida
5,my family loved this especially my husband who is kinda picky
5,i have made potatoe soup for years this is by far the best
5,this is the first time ive made potato soup i searched for recipes here and chose i finally decided to try this one to take to work for a birthday lunch we have one every month everybody loved it thanks coleen and taste of home
5,this was my first time making potato soup what a great recipe i had smoked sausage in the freezer so i used that instead of bacon gave the soup a smoky nice flavor i had extras so i froze some and reheated later and it was just as good this is a winner
5,got this from a dear friend we each have kids so there are of us total when we are together everyone of us love it that is pretty good pleasing all kids at once i added leftover spiral cut ham and it was delicious love this recipe and super easy and quick for our large family
5,this is the best soup i have ever made i will be making it all the time and the recipe will be going out to all my friends
5,i tried this recipe after reading a few of the other reviews so i had an idea of some additions i would make to the recipe i doubled the applesauce amount to cup and added more extra ripe bananas i also added tsp black walnut extract instead of actually using walnuts because we have a toddler who isnt eating nuts yet i also added approximately teaspoons cinnamon sugar the result was a very moist incredibly tasty banana bread loaf
5,i cannot recommend this recipe enough ive been into baking for years since before i found out that i was gluten intolerant and its been hard to find a banana bread recipe that isnt too dense or too try this is the one after reading the comments i made the following substitutions which yielded an incredibly moist and flavorful banana bread brown sugar a good squirt of honey instead of c sugar c plain greek yogurt instead of c applesauce c coconut oil instead of canola omitted nuts and added coconutmade mini muffin tins and one loaf
5,for some reason it wouldnt let me rate this recipe stars only would let me rate but it is a five star this is a delicious moist and tasty recipe as is very difficult to find a gluten free banana bread recipe that creates a very moist tasty outcome easy to make and very flavorful i love that it makes two loaves and you dont need to put butter on the finished product for more moisture i would like to try some other alterations like coconut oil yogurt option brown sugar or honey less sugar options as healthier choices but its a must try recipe you wont be disappointed especially if you use overripe bananas and follow recipe as is thank you for sharing
5,this was delicious i made two slight changes i used cup of apple sauce and i changed the oil to coconut oil instead i love this recipe i have tried hundreds of gluten free banana bread recipes and this one is the best i am sorry some had a hard time with the recipe because this banana bread is top notch
5,i loved the way this recipe came out my friend sent it me because she wanted to try a gf recipe so i figured id check it out as well i substituted olive oil for canola oil because i didnt have canola oil also i used a half cup of sugar and added chocolate chips for this recipe i made muffins instead of a loaf and for that i baked the muffins for minutes which was a perfect amount of time for them the end result was very moist and delicious muffins it made muffins i filled the cups almost to the top so they were quite full i usually cut the sugar on recipes especially when they call for one cup it just seems excessive i considered using honey as a substitute for the sugar and may try the recipe again doing just that i think what helps this recipe stay so moist is adding the apple saucetldr recipe was delicious
5,awesome recipe thank you first great tasting breadsubstituted applesauce with blended blueberries used a tablespoon of two less of sugar and added a couple handfuls of blueberries and walnuts yummy
5,i love this recipe because we all have most of the ingredients or substitutions at home i used a coconut flour mamas coconut blend gluten free flour found at tj maxx so to complement this i used coconut oil and a few flakes of unsweetened coconut on top with pecans i had a guest staying at my house that was gluten free but all the other guests said they couldnt tell the difference and gobbled up the bread then asked to take the muffens home i made one loaf and muffins with this recipe fabulous
5,wow very moist very flavorful and so easy to make you can definitely make just as the recipe reads or change it up i added only cup sugar but sprinkled some cinnamon and sugar on the top before baking it was plenty sweet i received praise from two coworkers who are gluten free and this is the best compliment
5,seem to be making this on a weekly basis for months now wonderfully moist i do add cinnamon
5,this is the best gluten free bread i have ever had i did tweak the recipe slightly egg whites only added tsp of baking powder no sugar or sweetener it took about bananas to make cups organic tree ripened olive oil instead of canola added cinnamon didnt add any nuts but would have been lovely
5,i just made this i replaced the sugar with c of pyure stevia amp i used c of bobs red mill gluten free to baking flour and i substituted the canola oil with vegetable oil it tastes wonderful you cant taste any difference between the gluten free and regular banana bread it doesnt rise as high but its very light and moist only had to bake for min please try it you will be so happy you did
5,excellent recipe made just a few adjustments didnt add all the sugar the bananas i had were really sweet added some butter made cake more moist perfect recipe
5,loved this recipe i used olive oil instead of canola oil instead of sugar i used about c maple syrup seemed a little soupy so i added an extra cup gf flour my blend of gf flour is brown rice flour potato starch and tapioca flour so i added teaspoon xantham gum wasnt too sweet either
5,used cup of coconut sugar instead of cup this was really delicious it made loaf and muffins i sprinkled the muffins with chocolate chips they were a winner
5,wow this is such an easy recipe to followthe bread is great as we made it as written i will make this over and over again the only thing i added was chocolate chips instead of nuts as i had no nuts
5,this was fantastic like the others i did make a few changes used a full pound of hamburger used beef broth nearly cups not chicken broth used the precooked frozen hash brown potatoes to save time added probably another cup of velveeta plus a big handful of shredded chedder cons took at least an hour to cook with constant attention its not a quick meal even with the added beef it barely served six of us and that was with a homemade loaf of bread as a side for dipping
5,this is a perennial favourite i think the velveeta makes the soup tend to develop a skin on top if it cools at all so i usually alter the recipe slightly by making a sauce of the flour butter milk amp real cheddar and then stirring it into the soup i have yet to find someone who doesnt like this
5,yummy even my picky non soup loving family member loved it
5,this is awesome soup my husband requests it regularly
5,i made this for a work potluck last week and it was a hit
5,this is an excellent meal i didnt change a thing in the recipe this soup is hearty and so very good just as written ive made it for numerous potlucks and other occasions and the pot always goes home empty my sons friends say this is the best soup theyve ever tasted
5,absolutely wonderful my entire family loves this recipe and it will become a staple in my list of menu options
5,this is one soup everyone loved great flavor very filling a yummy recipe i need to keep
5,haha that this should be featured todayi have the ingredients on the counter waiting for this to be made tomorrow ive just been longing for soup weather and its finally heading this way it is one of the best soups ever i do change it up now and againthis time im using sharp cheddar instead of velveta sometimes i add bacon pieces ive tried it using frozen hash browns but did not care for that flavorsome weird after taste that said its a wonderful recipe written as is
5,this is one the best i have ever had next time i will ad pd of ground beef and pd of sausage i like it with a little more flavor i noticed julieeee was going to use sharp cheddar i was wondering if it would be stringy instead of melting all the way but i see someone used it so i will also try that i made it last year for people at my christmas party they all loved it
5,why did i wait so long to try this excellent recipe as is but i tweaked just a tad i doubled the meat and added a little crumbled bacon i like bacon cheeseburgers i subbed extra sharp cheddar for the velveeta because i always have it and never have velveeta i also used plain greek yogurt instead of the sour cream i didnt want to buy a whole carton of sour cream and a single serving of the yogurt worked perfectly thank you joanie shawhan
5,changed it up a bit myself added bacon and used the bacon grease to make the rue added c milk skim and lowfat sharp cheddar cheese was delicious
5,im not a big soup person but i love this soup i also added bacon bits and since i hatevelveeta i used colbyjack cheese yummmm
5,this was fantastic i followed the recipe as it is given but doubled the batch i was afraid there wouldnt be enough thats why i doubled it but it made a lot it was delicious very creamy and satisfying i will be sharing some of whats left with my mom and will have at least more meals worth for the freezer
5,this is a great recipe i own a bampb so occasionally i need to come up with something for gf guests and this particular guest is also dairy free so this recipe was exactly what i needed i made of the recipe and baked it as muffins and it was absolutely fabulous only took minutes to bake small muffins and reduced the oven temp to i probably used a little extra apple sauce made it myself with sliced apples and oil and cooked till soft and not quite enuf bananas and i had my doubts with it being as wet as it was when it went into the oven but they rose nicely and browned and were a hit she ate muffins and all week had not been eating much of anything i had made thank youand i left out the nuts but im sure that would have been fine
5,excellent recipe i increased oil to half cup because i had no applesauce of course it would be healthier with the applesauce
5,both my fiancee and her friend both raved about this banana bread recipe my fiancee has celiac and her friend who doesnt have it said its the best banana bread theyve ever tried not only that they couldnt believe it was gluten free thank you taste of home
5,excellent recipe tastes great we did make a couple changes to accommodate our ingredients and our taste we had homemade sweetened applesauce so we cut the amount of sure in half we doubled the vanilla because we like vanilla no nuts this time perhaps next time we will add in dried cranberries or raisins
5,really enjoyed it i didnt have apple sauce so i used greek yogurt and extra vanilla still turned out great
5,absolutely delicious followed the recipe to the letter awesome
5,just made this following the recipe with no modifications the bread is awesome could not tell that it was gf next time i plan to substitute part of the sugar for stevia
5,we were totally impressed with this gf banana bread recipe it is almost impossible to get a soft non crumbly bread recipe using gf flour this one is superb i did not have any applesauce so i used same amount of apple butter in place of applesauce delicious thank you so much for this recipe five stars for sure
5,i am amazed i have experimented with many banana bread recipes and this one is by far the best
5,this is the best bread ever very fluffy
5,i like to wait until i have made a recipe at least times before i leave a review i have made this banana bread recipe over a dozen times it is excellent absolutely perfect however i reduce the sugar or else it tastes more like candy than bread it is absolutely indistinguishable from wheat banana bread and actually i think a lot better tasting thank you very much for this keeper
5,this recipe is great i just changed up a couple of things because i wanted to substitute the sugar and oils with something more healthy the bread was more moist than i have ever had in any banana bread so i used honey and coconut oil instead of sugar and canola oil i also added way more applesauce than is called for banana bread should be more of the consistency of something you can pour out into a baking pan initially the batter was too thick to pour out but as i added applesauce it became pourable and spreadable otherwise i really like the recipe and i only added walnuts not chocolate just walnuts and it was refreshingly not too sweet but just right and like i said really moist delicious
5,first and only gluten free banana bread recipe ill ever use even my husband chef and gluten lover couldnt get enough of this bread substitutionsadditions as follows replaced canola with organic raw coconut oil and sugar with raw honey i also added a cup or so crushed pecans about tsp of coconut extract cinnamon and nutmeg amazingly moist and wonderful flavor my husband is not a coconut fan
5,this was the greatest gluten free banana bread ever the only substitution i did was i did half coconut oil with half canola oil i also added cup of chocolate chips i took a loaf to work and it vanished in seconds with many requests for the recipe as they could not tell it was gluten free because it was so moist and flavorful
5,this one is a keeper and i would like to share one or two of my modificationsi used one cup of gf flour and one cup of coconut flour also gf and i added and extra half a teaspoon of vanilla very yummy indeed
5,i made this and shared it with my neighbors they didnt even know it was gluten free i told them and they couldnt believe it it is very moist and i gave it the three day test its still good and moist plus the best part i didnt change a thing from the recipe above
5,easy recipe moist flavorful bread i forget it is gluten free when eating it inexpensive breakfast or snack will make this my go to banana bread recipe
5,the banana bread was super moist very tasty however this doesnt have the rise of a normal banana bread which is usually about to inches high this was about inches high
5,this was excellent it was moist and did not taste like your typical crumbly gluten free breads i made them into muffins which cut the cooking time down to minutes at degrees also i didnt have any oil so substituted butter and in order to cut down on the carbohydrate count used truvia instead of regular sugar awesome recipe
5,made this and used egg replacer as we have egg allergies it was awesome fabulous recipe used king arthur gluten free flour and bobs red mill egg replacer i halved the sugar to cup and it was still plenty sweet i may cut it down to next time and see how sweet it is
5,awesome super moist you would never know these are gluten free
5,excellent would not change a thing
5,this is the best homemade banana bread i have made regular or gluten free my year old daughter who has to eat gluten free was like a little kid because i used to make regular all the time and shes been craving a good gf recipe it looks like weve found a keeper she and my husband absolutely loved it i will be using this recipe from now on thank you for sharing
5,this is the best banana bread ive ever made it is so moist and delicious made is as the recipe shows
5,best bananna bread ever i had never made gluten free anything and this turned out so well i did make a couple of changes so that didnt have to use sugari omitted the sugari added a generous half cup honeyi added an extra quarter cup gf flouri added an extra half teaspoon baking sodai added an extra teaspoon salti baked it for mins apparently honey can make stuff burn i could have even baked it for minsit was fantastic i am sure the recipe would be great as is if you dont do the honey switch the honey was plenty sweet btw
5,holy glutenfree deliciousness this recipe was so easy and honestly just amazing my baking time was a bit less than what was recommended mine were done in about min not min but wow it knocked my socks off if you love banana bread and have a gluten allergy or celiac like myself you will not feel slighted by this recipe i used pamelas bakingpancake gf flour and it made this a superb recipe its already a family favorite and will be a recipe i use year after year
5,didnt hurt to double nuts i used pecans and also added cup crasins
5,i cant review flavor yet as its currently baking away but the recipe was simple and quick a few changes though splenda in place of sugar three egg whites amp one whole egg were watching our cholesterol intake homemade fruit sauce instead of apple sauce and since everyone commented about soupy batter i added a cup of hemp seeds to think and add a little extra nutrition punch let you know how it tastes
5,at last a moist delicious gluten free banana bread recipe i used one cup gf all purpose flour and one cup brown rice flour bc thats what i had on hand i also substituted coconut oil for the canola oil and stevia for the sugar thanks for sharing honestly it taste like a great cake delicious
5,this is the best gluten free recipe for banana bread so far i have family try it and surprised i used gluten free flour as it tastes like the real thing and so moist i was skeptical how soupy it is with all the ingredients mixed together dont be alarmed with the soupiness as it bakes perfectly i made my own gluten free flour and followed the recipe to the t next time i will try to substitute with coconut oil vs canola oil
5,i did a half recipe of this and added t of cinnamon and it came out amazing everyone is right this is very moist and delicious
5,its a winner for sure loved the texture amp taste
5,i agree with everyone else this recipe is fabulous moist and delicious people will not think it is gluten free i used pecans instead of walnuts because thats what i had on hand
5,this recipe makes fantastic banana bread my mom always used spices in her banana bread so i added tsp cinnamon tsp cloves and tsp nutmeg i used coconut butter instead of the oil it turned out great moist and delicious it did not leave that dry mouth need a drink now feeling like most glutenfree baked goods leave i loved it my husband loves it too and he is not glutenfree thank you so much for this recipe a and thanks to my daughter in law for asking me to find a glutenfree banana bread recipe she could use for her girl scout troop my search led me here the girls are going to love it
5,really tasty even my friends who can have gluten love it
5,can this recipe be cut in half if so would you use tsp baking soda i just want to make the loaf just to try it
5,im not gluten free but i wanted to try a gluten free recipe and settled with this one i halved the original recipe and baked just one loaf i also added tsp of cinnamon at first just looking at the texture of a slice i thought i wouldnt like it at all but i tried it and it tasted great it was moist and the flavors are spot on
5,wow so tasty and the perfect texture people will be floored that this is gluten free this went like a dream i altered the recipe in these four waysi increased the ingredients by another because i needed a third loaf i used warmed coconut oil instead of canola oil i added chopped dates to the batter i added t cinnamonand in my oven possibly because of loaves at a time perfection in minutes enjoy
5,my husband and i love this recipe instead of loaves i make muffins and reduce the baking time to minutes i also add a cup of herseys cinnamon chips yum
5,my family loved this banana bread my daughter and my husband can only enjoy gluten free recipes i added dried cranberries to the mix and wow what a splendid treat
5,this was spot on delicious i replaced applesauce with greek yogurt and the canola oil with coconut it was perfect texture taste i pretty much gobbled half a loaf down before it even cooled yum
5,this recipe is awesome i use my own flour mix and add cinnamon nutmeg ginger and cloves i like spice i also just use two large bananas everything else exactly to the recipe and i havent had a bad batch yet it makes mini loaves everyone in the family gets their own loaf and they never even have a chance to cool thank you for this yummy banana bread recipe
5,my entire family loved it i substituted coconut oil for canola amp agave nectar for sugar to make it a cleaner version
5,this was amazing instead of prepared applesauce i vitamixed a small apple cup and added med bananas about cups substituted coconut oil instead of canola cup walnuts and omitted vanilla between the of us and grandma visiting it was gone in days today i am going to do the same but substitute the apple with raspberry i may substitute half the flour out with almond meal or coconut flour well see thank you
5,this is a great recipe to introduce people to how delicious gluten free can be be careful though when this is fresh out of the oven some might lose control
5,very moist
5,perfect slightly tweaked this recipe too by using my homemade apple butter instead of applesauce very moistlove it star
5,i just made this today one baking pan with walnuts the other without both delicious is there any reason why the walnuts are not mixed into the batter rather than sprinkled on top please let me know thanks ps i made no substitutions and used homemade applesauce
5,this bread is very good it may be a little too moist for some but i found it to be good my daughter has gone to glutenfree and sugarfree i replaced the sugar with coconut sugar and it turned out great i will be making this again
5,ive never made gf banana bread before but i have made other gf goodies that do turn out pretty good but notably different from their nongf counterparts this banana bread was absolutely amazing and easy its just like regular banana bread amp i received multiple compliments on it thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe
5,thank you for posting this recipe i changed it a bit with fine results heres what i did omitted the applesauce and used a tad less sugar used a tad more flourmaybe a few extra tablespoons because i did not measure flour exactly used softened butter instead of oil and baked the batter in one larger glass loaf pan instead of two smaller ones i used whole walnuts not chopped walnuts toward the end of baking last minutes i lowered the oven temperature to degrees this came out the best so far out of all the gluten free recipes for banana bread i have tried i also used a homemade recipe for gluten free flour that contains the following white rice flour brown rice flour potato starch tapioca starch pectin and xanthan gum the raw batter was thick going into the pan once the butter and sugar were creamed i basically dumped everything else in including whole peeled bananas and whipped it all up in my kitchen aid mixer for less than a minute i liked the sprinkled nuts on topwhich i did not measure as opposed to mixing them into the batter i just made sure the top of the batter was covered nicely with walnuts the nuts get nice and toasted and it looks good too by the way there is no milk in this recipe perhaps leaving out the applesauce is why the batter was not soupy i like to alter recipes when i dont have all the ingredients on hand i also like this recipe because it uses a lot of ripe bananas which i had plenty of today
5,this recipe was delish i was a bit afraid of it being dry but boy was i wrong i exchanged some ingredients egg whites vs regular eggs stevia vs real sugar coconut oil vs canola oil sea salt vs table salt for the gluten free flour i used bobs red mill sweet white sorghum flourmy man loved it and so did my little one
5,omg my first gf bread just came out of my oven and i love it so do my hubby too thank you so much for sharing that recipe i didnt change anything and it came out so good
5,i loved it the best gf banana bread recipe by far its easy to prepare and keeps well in the fridge for more than a week
5,fantastic recipe taste like the real thing a real winner
5,make it once a week this is probably the best banana bread i have ever had moist not crumbly and makes super french toast
5,great recipe i made it exactly as it says but made mini loafs ive made it a few times and it turns out great
5,i followed exactly except to add some chocolate chips yummy
5,i made this recipe yesterday my youngest child has a wheat allergy and is a very picky eater he loved the banana bread my oldest child also loved the bread thank you for a wonderful allergy friendly recipe
5,i am gluten free for almost years out of my grandchildren are also gluten free we all love this recipei make it for them often the problem is everyone loves it so the gluten free people have to hide it or they end up with crumbs thanks
5,lovely recipe my banana bread was perfect i didnt have applesauce so i left it out and it was still devinegreat and very easy recipe
5,this was an awesome recipe i only made one loaf i halved the recipe the best banana bread i ever made our kids ate it up there was none left i didnt use the walnuts since we didnt have any
5,my daughters are always begging me to make banana bread but since having to go gluten free as well as many other ingredients we are banned from digestively baking has been only a few trials and mostly errors due to consistency issues this recipe came out awesome the flour i used had xanthum gum added so i am thinking that helped the bread keep its shape my regular banana breads never came out of the pan in loaf formlol i added chocolate chips but kept the rest of the recipe the same will definitely make this often yum
5,i highly recommend substituting coconut oil for the canola it makes such a huge difference in the moistness of the bread it also tastes better and i also add chocolate chips
5,first recipe ive made from this web site excellent i used pamelas gf baking mix and substituted in cup of coconut flour i also used the coconut flour instead of canola oil finally i added bag of chocolate chips divine
5,this was my best gf bread to date used pamelas baking mix and a stick of butter instead of oil left out apple sauce since didnt have any baked in one large loaf pan came out perfectly moist and delicious
5,i just pulled these out of the oven and couldnt wait until the bread was cool to taste they are so good next time i will take the advice of a few others to bake it in one larger loaf pan instead of two they were fine in the two but i didnt have the exact size i made it exactly as the recipe stated other than adding the nuts because one of my granddaughters is allergice to tree nuts great texture
5,just made this today my first recipe baking with gluten free flour kit turned out even after putting it in the oven and realizing i forgot the eggs i quickly grabbed it out of the oven whipped up the eggs mixed them in hoping for the bestit is great so light no one would ever guess it is gluten freei did make only one in a x pan and it is perfect i will make it again hopefully next time i will remember the eggs
5,omgi just finished baking this bread and it was delicious i baked it as is with the exception of things i omitted the walnutsallergic and used a spring form pan instead thats all i had it still came out great will bake again with less sugar i think cup wouldve been better
5,question has anyone tried this recipe subbing out the bananas or zucchini it s that time of the year where zucchini is so cheap
5,usually i dont condone reviewing a recipe if i have adjusted it in any way but this one is so adaptable i decided to go ahead i helped my son make this we only had bananas so we halved the recipe and swapped out canola for coconut oil more calories but everyone is saying its good for autism so i am having him use it whenever possible anyway the bread was moist and delicious my husband who is notoriously fussy called it lethal because he didnt want to stop eating we wont be cutting this recipe in half next time
5,excellent this truly does taste like normal banana bread you would never know its gluten free i had to use bananas to get the required cups
5,wonderful recipe very moist slightly crumbly so remove from the pan carefully we used rice flour which is what we had on hand and substituted chopped apple for the applesauce no one will know its glutenfree delicious
5,i just had my first piece absolutely delicious even my husband the skeptic loves it thank you so much
5,like what everyone else wrote this is very moist with a very nice flavor i used pamelas baking mix and reduced the sugar to cup someone else wrote that she added cup baking mix and i might try that next time to get a larger loaf this tastes like the real thing and you wont even know its gluten free

5,this recipe is as good as the real thing i folled the recipe exactly as written but baked in three smaller pans i could not believe how moist it was i have since adapted the recipe by substituting banans for canned pumpkin added some cinnamon nutmeg and a cup of chopped apples and made a fabulous pumpkin apple bread

5,we used this recipe in our mini doughnut maker and loved it we substituted the walnuts for freeze dried strawberries
5,i followed the suggestion of the other reviewers and added c sorghum flour my bread turned out beautifully i baked this recipe and my regular recipe and had the family taste test them side by side although they guessed which one was gluten free an observation was that the gf bread was more moist from here on out this is my goto recipe
5,so moist and flavorful out of
5,this is the best banana bread i have ever made or eaten it is the real thing just because the flour used is gluten free does not mean that its not the real thing everyone raved about it
5,i forgot to mention that i added the walnuts right to the batter and sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top i used two foil loaf pans and it was done exactly when it said in the recipe perfect texture
5,this recipe was simple and delicious i used cups gf all purpose flour and cup rice flour i also cut the sugar to cup finally i didnt have loaf pans so i baked it in a large stainless steel skillet for minutes the bread rose and was perfectly cooked thanks i definitely make this again
5,i used all purpose gluten free baking mix from arrowhead mills i found that if you use two disposable bread tins they do come out doughy in the center they come out perfect and both loafs were consumed in one day i making this again now
5,at first i wasnt sure i liked this recipe as it was my first gf banana breadthen after i devoured the half of the loaf i realized i finally found a good sub for my usual recipe added about a cup of fresh blueberrys to one of the loaves which turned out great my husband couldnt even tell it was gluten free
5,best gluten free recipe i have made my whole family loved it
5,i just love this recipe you really cant tell its gf my husband and oldest daughter couldnt tell i read the reviews and went with the extra cup flour they said it made it less denser it tasted so moist and fluffy will keep in my recipe file
5,simple recipe not dry not gummy in the middle i used c rice flour and c sorghum i used coconut oil since i didnt have any canola oil melt first accidentally used c instead of recipe still turned out good also used almond extract cause i didnt have vanilla baked in a x pan for min id like to try adding shredded coconut next time maybe chocolate chips
5,this was my st time making a gluten free banana bread i am new to gluten free lifestyle per dr orders i am also trying to get my family into the lifestyle so we can enjoy food together as i always feel left out i made this recipe without the applesauceper the advice of other reviews i also added a cup more flour but i used bobs red mills pancake mix i only used eggs and sugar my family loved it they had no idea it was gluten free i added enjoy life mini chocolate chips to one loaf and they loved it next time i think i will add more vanilla n cinnamon ty so much i been missing my banana bread
5,this banana bread is amazing i just started working with a toddler that cannot have any gluten and looking for things that he can enjoy eating did anyone try to make this in cupcake or mini loaf sizes do you think that it could work
5,love this recipe made it a couple of times now and both times delicious i never thought id have banana bread again yum make sure you add xanthan gum to the flour mixture if you are using bobs all purpose flour to make it light t per cup of flour
5,this turned out fantastic i used cups of bobs red mill gluten free ap flour and added an extra cup of sorghum flour i also substituted refined sugar for coconut sugar to make it a bit healthier my hubby and i gobbled this up
5,pnew at glutenfree most does not taste good this is great and moist i used pumpkin in place of the applesauce superp
5,excellent bread convection baked at in a pyrex pan and metal pan the pyrex took minutes more minutes used an addl c of maple grove farms pancake mix and t xanthan gum with c sugar and medium ripe bananas its not overly sweet ill add chocolate chips next time
5,i used this recipe as my first attempt at baking glutenfree bread as promised it tastes like the real thing my dance teammates are still in disbelief that the loaf was glutenfree note i added a simple crumb topping brown sugar glutenfree all purpose flour almonds and butter prior to baking
5,this has been a family favorite for years i cut the velveeta in half and to make it simpler i saute my vegetables then make my cream sauce on top of them all in the same pan so good and healthy too
5,this soup is great comfort food for a cold night i increased my hamburger to lb used cup of heavy cream in at the end and extra velveeta cheese about oz more delicious
5,this was a big hit at bible study tonight i doubled the recipe two guys went back for a rd helping everyone wanted the recipe will definitely make it again
5,this is a hearty and easy go to recipe for my family even my picky eater children like this i substituted cheddar for velveeta and prefer the beef broth to the chicken broth after trying it both ways
5,this soup is amazing i will definitely make this again the ideas in the other reviews are something i will try you wont be dissappointed
5,i signed up just to rate this soup by far the best cheeseburger soup recipe ive tried to say that it is a family favorite would be an understatement my family friends neighbors and coworkers love it i added a couple of extra things a little paprika and garlic and it really hits the spot
5,i took this to our churchs annual chili cookoff as an alternative for those who didnt want chili what a surprise when i won nd place people raved and were disappointed when the crockpot was empty i had not made it before but my family says that this needs to be a staple in our meal rotations i track points with weight watchers and even with the velveeta it only comes out to ppv not bad for a hearty and satisfying soup
5,found this recipe a few years ago and since then ive made it every year as a winter tradition meal my kids would say this is their favorite thing to eat of all time my son even asks for it in the summer any time i ask what they want for dinner his response for years now has been cheeseburger soup
5,my husband and i were both skeptical but this is amazing
5,ive been trying lots of recipes for a gf banana bread and hands down this is the best one my gf four mix was cups brown rice flour and cup bobs redmill gf flour mix and tsp xanthum gumcouldnt taste the gf flour at allone word for this recipe p e r f e c t
5,everyone at our church loved this i substituted cup of truvia for the sugar amp used mushy frozen bananas as well as refrigerated ones had to add an extra cup of gf allpurpose baking mix still turned out well several people were happy it was gluten amp sugarfree definitely a keeper
5,my daughter has celiac disease she loves this recipe because she says it tastes like real food after having to give up so many flavors thank you we plan on adding different chocolates to it and nuts for variations
5,yum im so happy i gave this recipe a try my gf boyfriend was very happy
5,this is an extremely moist bread with a strong banana flavor my family and friends found it very tasty i will definitely be making it many times again
5,this recipe really is good while it bakes it smells so delicious that you just want to dive in before it is finished baking for me minutes was enough the bread was not crumbly or dry it was the perfect amount of moisture and the flavor was great i am very impressed since it is a gf recipe some do not turn out this well
5,tastes just like any other banana bread i made two batches one following the recipe and one with an extra cup of gf flour they both tasted the same the difference being the size and density of the loaf the one with extra flour turned out like a traditional loaf of banana bread while the one following the recipe turned out more dense and flatter both batches didnt last more than a day in my house
5,this truly was a winner i followed another cooks suggestions and added in an additional c of gf flour so i used c of a finely ground brown rice mix that i use for most of my recipes and then an additional c of sorghum flour which bakes like a dream in gf baked goodies i also made another applesauce version where i subbed in applesauce for the bananas and then used greek yogurt in place of the original c of applesauce it produced the same great texture and wonderful light taste and for sugar in both recipes i used c raw cane sugar which is brown and tastes like brown sugar and then c agave nectar the dark amber kind it was perfectly sweet but not too heavy
5,this bread was awesome my gf kids and non gf kid loved it added raisins and walnuts
5,this bread is great you would never know that this is gf i varied the recipe just a bit i used c gf all purpose flour and c gf sorghum flour i also used frozen mashed overripe bananas they are very juicy and this allowed me to eliminate the canola oil next time i will add some chocolate chips as an extra treat
5,i made this bread and it was wonderful i added tsp of xanthan gum and tsp of cinnamon omitted the applesauce and used half brown and half granulated sugar i honestly could not tell the difference between this and the traditional recipe ive always used thanks so much ill be making this frequently
5,the breads just came out of the oven and they look perfect the aroma in the house was heavenlylike someone else had mentioned i didnt use applesauce i added teaspoon of xanthan gum tablespoons of coconut oil and teaspoon cinnamon powderi had to cut a piece i couldnt wait for the bread to cool
5,this is just the best when i had added all of the ingredients i thought i messed up someplace the dough was almost as runny as cake batter but i baked it anyway thinking i would end up throwing it all away and to my great surprise it was just the best thank you so much from my daughter and me who havent had any baked products for so long because of gluten
5,fantastic flavorful chicken hubby and i both loved it i halved the marinade and made boneless breasts i forgot to marinate it the night before and it was still amazing a definite easy keeper
5,this is a family favorite
5,this recipe is amazing we changed it slightly by replacing the marinating step with putting it in a crockpot on low for hours then we threw the chicken on a hot grille for just a couple of minutes per side the chicken fell right off of the bone and because the chicken cooked in the marinade we were able to use it over rice which was heavenly thanks for the recipe

5,fantastic thats it
5,tasted great cooked as recipe stated with exact quantities thighs were tender and a big hit with the family word of warning if cooking on a bbq be prepared for a lot of cleaning i soaked grills overnight and the used oven cleaner our gerni high pressure cleaner still could not remove the vharred marinate the brown sugar hardens like cement and i ended up using a hammer and screwdriver to try and get it to let go next time i will use a disposable foil grill on top of the bbq burners

5,i made this the other night and it was very good good taste juicy chicken and my husband who doesnt like too many things new liked it the only thing i would caution against is dont cook on a george foreman grill i think it was the brown sugar it formed into a hard shell and was nearly impossible to cut through it im sure this is really good on an outside grill
5,made this a nd time and it did not disappoint again very aromatic while grilling amazing taste and juicy definitely going in the recipe box
5,very good and easy to make
5,cant beat this recipe
5,i didnt use the broth plus i used chili sauce instead of soy sauce and it tasted great

5,my family loves this recipe i reduced the amount of ingredients to fit boneless chicken breast and i have an indoor grill favor is fabulous
5,i have to admit i tried this recipe because i thought the name was so cute i was going to a football party so i used wings instead of thighs it was a big hit they licked the platter clean

5,the best huli huli chicken recipe ever i have made it twice in one week
5,i followed this recipe exactly and it turned outamazing my husband and i enjoyed it immensely thank you very much for sharing i cant wait to make it again
5,i used this on chicken breasts and my family enjoyed it turned out quite moist
5,i had to make this after seeing it in my email recently and reading several of the reviews there are many items i did change to make it lighter such as using lean ground beef using skim milk omitting the sour cream i chose to use real cheese colby and pepper jack vs processed velveeta i also decided make it in the crockpot hours we basically sauted up the meat vegetables and made the roux then added everything except the dairy into the slow cooker and a half hour before serving placed the milk and cheeses in the crockpot it turned out great it is very creamy flavorful and satisfying on a cold day
5,modified to a slow cooker recipe and this was truly amazing i will be making this again
5,prepared with lb of grd round used half amp half instead of milk thats what i had on hand used real cheese and did not use the sour cream very creamy as is and full of flavor perfect for the qt saucepot
5,absolutely delicious i didnt have enough chicken broth which is unusual for my house so i used beef broth instead and it was delicious my son who usually complains if i put celery in anything ate big bowls and didnt even notice i diced it very small thank you for sharing
5,this is a wonderful soup recipe i have made it multiple times over the years and it is always a big hit
5,good soup reminded me of beer cheese soup family loved
5,for clipnmom cups of cubed cheese measures volume whereas the oz of cheese measures weight so eight ounces of cheese cubed should fill a oz measuring cup
5,good recipe but i dont like using processed cheese either so always substitute with some cheddar and a little cream cheese
5,i follow this recipe exactly as written amp its delicious every time
5,i made this soup last night for the first time it was delicious and it will be one i use again and again i made some slight changes though i used fresh rosemary and thyme instead of basil really tasty i also used white cheddar in place of velveeta cheese in addition to those changes i did not have sour cream on hand so i made a basic rue as a thickener
5,i made this for lunch today and i have to say it is one of the most delicious soups i have ever made creamy cheesy potatoes and beef heaven in a bowl
5,the soup was yummy and i paired it with garlic bread and a saladi changed the recipe slightly added some garlic and extra cheese
5,this is a very tasty easy soup recipe i did make a few changes for my preferences instead of ground beef i used ground turkey and instead of the velveeta i used ounces cream cheese and ounces shredded sharp cheddar because ground turkey really does not require draining i cooked the ground turkey and veggies all at the same time also if you like condiments on your burgers you can always squeeze a little bit into each individual serving might be a great suggestion for making this recipe even more kid friendly i found that dijon mustard works really well this will be a regular goto recipe for me
5,have made this one several times never any left i only marinated for about three hours flavor was great
5,this chicken was delicious
5,hubby made and was very tender juicy and really good flavor only thing he did different was add some red pepper
5,i followed this recipe as is and my husband grilled it up for our super bowl party we got rave reviews and look forward to making this again soon

5,tasty and tangy grilled chicken i halved the recipe and used boneless skinless chicken breast pieces
5,fantastic i didnt have sherry or broth so i used a dry marsala i had on hand my family and friends really enjoyed this for sunday dinner this marinade would be good with any cut of chicken we used thighs and wings i served this with macaroni salad and fresh cut pineapple
5,so much flavor was a huge success at fathers day barbeque everyone couldnt get enough i used both thighs and skinless boneless breasts i used chicken broth and tsp of ground ginger will definitely make this again and again

5,i searched for the best ratio of ingredients and this one is perfect i didnt see a lot of success with tsp of baking powder i read it was metallic and not very tasty i also didnt want to have to use powder and soda wanted it simple only thing id tweak is sugar i added instead of tbl sugar but thats only because its how i like them you might prefer tblsfor me this recipe is a keeper and i would definitely melt the butter and let it sit for the few minutes it says to

5,this is for phoebew why would you write a review never having made the recipe so you dont like velveeta use something else doesnt take a rocket scientist

5,added the crumbled bacon and it was yummy this soup was a big hit with my crowd will be making this many times over thnx ps dont skip the velveeta

5,excellent recipe everyone was pleased with the outcome i have been asked to make it again in the future great for a cold blah day this one is a keeper
5,we love this soup i have to double it it tastes even better the next day
5,ive always wanted to make a home made soup and i tried this recipe and it came out so good my kids couldnt get enough of it i even took left overs to my grandmother who is the cook in our family and she gobbled it up and loved it as well my kids are already asking when im going to make it again
5,best soup weve ever had and we really love homemade soups excellent
5,tasted fantastic i smothered mine in easterdinner leftover turkey and gravy and i now understand why chicken and waffles is so popular in the states great recipe for sure
5,these are the best pancakes i have ever had although the batter is thick if you use a measuring cup to put it on a pan it is really worth it for the fluffiness you maintain i found this recipe a few months back and have been making it every sunday and sometimes saturday too
5,i thought these pancakes were great tips make sure all your liquidwet ingredients are at room temperature i microwaved the milk to warm it up so that the melted butter wouldnt solidify once it was added to cold milk for the eggs i soaked them in hot water to bring them to room temperature then very lightly scrambled them before combining with the milk and butter sift the dry ingredients before mixing in the wet ingredients mix until combined but be careful not to overmix
5,sure to cook on low heat otherwise pancakes come out tasteless and burnt other than that great recipe
5,i added a tsp of vanilla and blueberries and these were excellent my kids gobbled them up
5,best ever pancake ive made i used chocolate milk its fluffy and delicious
5,these were excellent to make them even fluffier let the batter rest for about minutes after you stir it up mmmm
5,they were so good i added a spoonful of hersheys cocoa to the batter to make chocolate pancakes
5,they were so good me and my brother made them and i doubled the ingredients for my family and it was so delicious i added vanilla for more flavor and it was the best recipe ever my family really liked it and im only
5,this recipe came out perfect for me tall fluffy pancakes which were fully cooked inside but deeply golden on the outside i used melted butter and since it was salted i cut down the salt by a pinch also i added blueberries just before cooking
5,i thought this recipe was great although i only got pancakes using a c measure like other reviewers i always put in vanilla today i sprinkled with cinnamon before i flipped them excellent decision
5,these were very tasty pancakes i substituted cup of whole wheat flour for cup of the allpurpose then sprinkled blueberries over them while they cooked they were tall and very fluffy
5,ive been looking online for the perfect pancake recipe after trying several others my family agrees this is the keeper my year old is about as picky as they come and she loves these fluffy and delicious
5,i made this the other morning and added chocolate chips since my kids love chocolate chip pancakes and this receipe is a winner i will not be buying boxed pancake mix again thanks
5,this is by far the best pancake recipe ive found and done it needs more than stars ive done with cinnamon and little xtra sugar and used chocolate milk instead of white milk but have to double up the milk if u switch and added little vanilla extract
5,havent done it yet but i trust this website
5,i just made these pancakes and they were awesome better than any prepackage mix from the store they are more then worth the stars
5,great recipe to wake up to and eat i recommend adding less baking soda or replace it with baking powder as the taste of the baking soda is a bit too strong but this is a great recipe especially if you add some fruit such as blueberries
5,these were amazing my year old and i made them together so that tells you it was pretty simple so much better than the box and less ingredients we added blueberries to half and chocolate chips to the other half and it was a hit for the fam yo picky toddler ambitious preteen highly recommend
5,absolutely delicious very fluffy will make these pancakes over and over
5,to shel these are the best you must have beaten the batter way too much when using baking powder you are not suppose to overbeatmix sounds like that was your problem the baking powder is what makes them so fluffy also you need to use a small fine mesh strainer to put the baking power through this will break up any clumps of powder otherwise you will have small pockets of baking powder that taste horrible give it another try do a half recipe youll be surprised
5,best pancakes ever very fluffy it is essential you only mix until everything is moist over beating will create flat pancakes i add tsp vanilla which i love but would still be great without
5,this is a great simple recipe we made it exactly as written though we did double it feeding teens and a toddler plus mom and dadthis was the perfect amount batter was perfect and they cooked up light and fluffy if you are looking for a easy basic good recipe look no further
5,this is one of my favorite pancake recipes very simple and good i will sometimes add vanilla or lemon juice to the recipe just for something different
5,these had great flavor i used mostly buttermilk because i had some to get rid of but this is a good recipe to have when i only have milk
5,these were delicious and easy to throw together in a pinch i doubled it for my family of
5,love the fluffiness of this pancake this recipe is quick and easy and very tasty
5,very lite pancake better with blue berries i will make this again
5,very fluffy and so fast to put together easy to dress up with vanilla and your favorite mix ins
5,my family loved this recipe the very first time i made itcant say that about all pancake recipes ive tried topped it off with a homemade strawberry syrup yummy
5,two words for this recipe yummo
5,these pancake are perfect to wake up to we always double or triple the recipe so theres plenty for everyone
5,this is my favorite pancake recipe everyone loves ithem they are so light and fluffy i have made these many many times and they always turn out perfect we often add blueberries or the kids like chocolate chips
5,loved it so fun and easy tomake this helped me a lot best pancakes i ever had
5,my ten year old daughter really loved these pancakes she declared them the fluffiest ever i have to admit that i agree they were very simple to make and deliciousi just made them for the second time and they were just as good as the first so i didnt just get lucky the first timeboth times ive doubled the recipeupdate these have become my go to pancake recipe for sleepover breakfasts several of her friends have declared them the best pancakes ever theyre so easy and so tasty
5,i substituted coconut oil for the shortening absolutely my all time favorite pancakes thank you for sharing
5,yum i doubled the batch and added cup milk and cup buttermilk needed to add a little more milk to thin the batter turned out light and fluffy
5,these pancakes were way better than bisquick box mix they were way fluffier and delicious my husband and year old loved them too the best part is the ingredients are things i always have on hand too
5,these pancakes had excellent flavor plus being tender and fluffy will definately keep this recipe to make them again
5,these pancakes truly were light fluffy and delicious i added about tsp of cinnamon to the dry ingredients and tsp vanilla to the wet ingredients my family loves vanilla flavored pancakes i also dropped fresh blueberries onto each pancake while the first side was cooking i had a bit of trouble combining the melted shortening with the milk and egg ultimately i heated the milk and shortening together in the microwave for about seconds and then whisked them together vigorously while adding the egg not sure if thats the best technique but i was pleased with the product
5,i think this is the recipe i used the other day i used c of flour and substituted c of quinoa flour for the remainder of the flourthey came out delicious and left me full of energy and a lasting feeling of fullnessi think this would make an excellent pancake for our children going off to school and their parents going off to work
5,best from scratch pancakes ive been trying different recipes and this one is it no more looking nice and fluffy and simple to make
5,i made these yesterday on a cold snowy new england morning wonderful i agree with another reviewer that they are better than bisquick im glad i gave these a try i will definitely make again
5,these are fabulous taste like box mix but so much better the batter is super thick so i always add a splash more milk to thin just a bit still stays nice and fluffy i love that this recipe doesnt use buttermilk like most pancake recipes because i dont always have it on hand
5,i couldnt find my go to recipe this morning so i tried these pancakes they are the best i added a tsp of vanilla and used butter instead of shortening with a bit more milk and voile they were just perfect so now these are my go to pancake recipe simple and deeeeeelicious
5,great pancake recipe fluffy and yummy and all ingredients that i have on hand i butter the skillet instead of using cooking spray to give it a slightly crisp buttery outside
5,easy and simplei love it
5,easy and tasty very similar to the pancakes my mom used to make
5,i just tried these and they were great i added toasted pecans to them
5,this is our new favorite we leave out the celery but use canned potatoes which cuts down on the cutting time we add a can of stewed tomatoes because a cheeseburger needs ketchup right as many reviewer mentioned this soup tastes even better the second dayif it makes it past the first
5,this soup is so good pure comfort food we like a little more meat so i used a pound of hamburger and replaced the velveeta with vt white cheddar i was low on milk so used a whole can of evaporated milk instead and omitted the sour cream it had the right thickness for our liking this is now in our regular meal rotation
5,i make this soup in large batches an everyone raves about it and ask for the recipe it freezes well so i always have plenty in the freezer and bring it out to serve with grilled cheese sandwiches when the weather get cold
5,made the soup with a few modifications i used lbs of ground beef _cartons of chicken broth cup of milk and half cup of heavy cream this is the best soup that i have ever eaten and my family loved it
5,made this last nightwas a hit even my husband who is not a soup fan said it was good will make again could use more meat i skipped the sour cream might try tomatoes next time as others suggested
5,this soup is amazing very easy to make i made mine exactly as the recipe called for
5,really yummy i used lb of ground beef to make it more filling will definitely make again

5,this soup is rich and delicious this is the second time ive made this recipe and i have made a couple of additions i use a pound of hamburger which is perfect for my family we like a punch of flavor so i add a can of rotel i use the emersion blender and all it does is add flavor and it doesnt change the color i fried some bacon and we added it as a garnish delicious
5,excellent its a meal in a bowl i used a pound of ground beef makes it a heartier soup
5,excellent we added some more velveeta and it was cheesy and awesome will definitely make it again
5,made this tonight and it was delish changed it by using a can of evaporated milk instead of the regular milk used just over a pound of hamburger cans of chicken broth cups of shredded cheddar and cup velveeta and did not use the flour thickener it was very tasty and hearty will make again
5,making this for the nd time i switch things around though for my family i use lbs ground beef garlic instead of onion turkey broth instead of chicken i also diced green peppers my taters are gold ones and smaller so i peeled diced topped with diced bacon before servingadds a smoky flavorwe use this as a dip soup mmm the best with scoop chips i make for supper main night then put leftovers in qt canning jarshubs had this at a truck stop one time and says mine is hands down the best soup ever
5,delicious even the kids love it

5,i was looking for a good pancake recipe i used this one added not quite a teaspoon of cinnamon a dash of ground ginger and nutmeg and of chopped pecans they were awesome
5,make sure to warm up your milk and to temper the egg and butter so it doesnt congeal
5,very good i also subbed t of oil for the shortening and it was plenty
5,very good recipe i used white wheat flour and coconut crystals in place of sugar also added vanilla and cinnamon
5,have tried these now with several substitutes for the shortening oil canned pumpkin sweet potato applesauce amp cinnamon baby food fruit purees and all work great very versatile also buttermilk makes them even fluffier these are our go to pancakes and loved by my toddler

5,this is my new favorite pancake recipe very few ingredients easy to makebut so good pancakes are super fluffly much fluffier than the pic shows the outside is a slightly crisp golden brown and the middle is a perfect dense cake this will be my sunday morning pancake recipe from now on
5,because of my sight i am always leery about cooking certain foods i cannot see down so i dont know if they are cookedthese pancakes were very good and a big confidence boosterthanks
5,these are a family favorite and they freeze really well too
5,good simple recipe
5,i substitute c canola oil for the melted shortening and it works great
5,amazing i dont have five spice so i used a little ginger cinnamon amp allspice the sauce thickened while simmering so there was no need for cornstarch so good
5,these are the best pancakes i use tablespoons of oil instead of the melted shortening and use buttermilk instead of regular the buttermilk will make the batter very thick and you will need to quickly spread it out on the griddle but makes all the difference you can increase the buttermilk to c to make the batter more pourable and the pancakes will still come out light and fluffy i have also doubled the recipe with equally good results
5,thanks for the recipe they turned out greatand the serving size is perfect this was what i was looking for thanks again
5,my family loves these pancakes they are very light and fluffy and are made of ingredients we always have on hand we usually double the recipe and it makes about larger pancakes and we make these with tbsp of oil instad of the shortening like some of the other reviewers
5,best pancakes ever i added a little more milk because the batter seemed to thick to pour big fluffy panakes will definitely make again
5,these are wonderful pancakes very easy to make as a last minute meal any time of the day i double the batch and freeze them for my kids they love how fluffy they are i will make these pancakes many more times thanks
5,cooks faster than my usual recipe for pancakes easy to make big fluffy and tasty yum
5,these are nice i like having light pancakes
5,great recipe i would defiantly make these again
5,these were quick and easy and by adding a little more sugar and baking powder they were sweet and fluffy my grandson ate them right off the griddle and said homemade was better than going out no more pancakes houses for him
5,i prepared this also for my coworkers breakfast i add little cinammon to give a better flavour and the taste it was really a hit i will make this again thank you
5,delicious those of you who substitued oil did tbs oil replace the cup of shortening
5,even though i had to add alot of extra milk to thin out the batter these were the best pancakes ive made from scratch in a long time thanks for posting this recipe its going into my favorites
5,this is my favorite chicken recipe ever i dont typically even like chicken but this recipe i make quite often a new staple in our family even my teen son loves the tangy sweet perfectly balanced flavor a definite must try once youll be hooked
5,easy to make and my family loved it best combination you could wish for
5,this is one of the best chicken recipes i have ever madethe balance of flavors was perfect tangy sweet salty and slightly spicy i browned my chicken and put it in a freezer bag with the sauce so that the only thing i had to do was simmer the ingredients in a pan such an easy delicious meal this will be a new goto meal for me
5,i made this for my wife and i per recipe served over rice and with stir fried vegetables it was great and easy to make
5,i have made this several times and shocked i havent previously reviewed i make it exactly as written which is quite unusual for me bone in skinless thighs are perfect for this recipe and i highly recommend sticking to that a close second is boneless skinless thighs i do not recommend chicken breasts because the texture is not a moist volunteer food editor
5,this recipe has become a family favorite and pairs well with sous vide cooking the chicken thighs can be sous vide cooked for hours at they are then easily browned in a skillet removed and the sauce added once the sauce comes to a boil add the cornstarchwater mix and once the sauce thickens put the chicken back in and serve cuts down on the final prep time love it
5,i made this recipe last night it was delicious and i will make this again the sauce is so tasty that i will try it on pork chops next i used swerve calorie brown sugar to make this lower carb i used rice wine vinegar instead of white vinegar and i reduced red pepper flakes to tsp which is just enough heat for me i finally got to use my chinese five spice great recipe
5,this was amazing i will definitely make this again
5,deeeelicious a little too sweet for my wifes diabetes so next im going to cut back on the sugar and my granddaughter found it too spicy think ill leave out the red chillies next time but every one cleaned their plates
5,i loved this but my husband thought it was too sweet id like to try again with less sugar
5,easy and delicious i halved the amount of crushed red peppers which was just enough spiciness for us next time will double the amount of sauce
5,very delicious a little too spiced for my family so next time ill cut the red pepper flakes in half otherwise a very easy dish to make
5,excellent my favorite part of the chicken however you could easily swap out thighs for breasts if you arent a dark meat eater if you dont have chinese spice a close substitute is garam masala use the same measurement
5,top fav recipe have made several times definitely use rice vinegar in place of white as well as chili sauce in place of ketchup the five spice is a must for fabulous flavor freeze spice for later repeat meals if nothing else we do add a bit more red pepper for extra heat also no need for the extra step of cornstarch slurry just mix that in with the rest of ingredients and pour over chicken and simmer minutes oh and double the sauce so yummy over the rice
5,tasty but this recipe is too sweet so i add sugar to taste
5,very good recipe i used chicken breasts as that was all i had i also did not have the fivespice powder other than that i followed the recipe as written very tasty thanks for sharing your recipe
5,i tripled the sauce using orange juice rather than water and adding more tbls of white vinegar for lbs skinless boneless chicken breastsbut totally forgot to add the brown sugar it was still delicious i will make again just to remember to add the brown sugar
5,we had these delicious chicken thighs tonight and cleaned our plates i followed the recipe exactly but did use splenda brown sugar that was the only change these are delicious and so easy to prepare we will definitely be having this again volunteer field editor
5,the best sauce ever i enjoy trying lots of recipes and trying to find good recipes for all cuts of chicken i will use this recipe from now on for thighs i am also thinking about trying it for wings
5,this was so good
5,my absolute favorite when i want oriental food at home i always double the sauce and usually have it over cauliflower rice instead of longgrain
5,made this last night and it was fabulous even my guy who has never eaten chicken thighs and did not want to loved it and rated about it i did not have the spice or the red pepper flakes but substituted some chili power and extra black pepper and it was still great we dont like really spicy foods so next time i may add the red papper flakes or a dash of the spice if i can find it to see if that changes anything this is just great and i am adding to my rotation recipe list
5,i have made this dish several times and i think it gets better each time i use bs thighs omit the green onions and double the sauce we love wings i may try those next
5,like some of the other reviewers i was missing a few ingredients didnt have any chicken so we used hamburger didnt have any orange juice so i used tomato juice didnt have reduced sodium soy sauce so used regular soy sauce didnt have any chinese five spice powder so i found five spices in my cabinet and use them instead didnt have any rice so used linguine all in all it was a truly wonderful recipe and my family will enjoy asian chicken thighs on a regular basis from now on
5,yummy yummy used boneless skinless thighs didnt have spice turned out great and will make again thanks for the recipe
5,this is an awesome recipe flavors are right oni would double the sauce recipe next time i make it so there is more to put on the rice i didnt have chinese fivespice so i looked it up and made my own
5,this is perhaps one of my most favorite recipes the flavor is outstandingand the leftovers are so versatile i use the leftover chicken in my homemade fried rice i double the recipe and quadruple the sauce
5,i love asian flavors and this recipe did not disappoint i followed the recipe but i did substitute sweet baby rays sweet red chili sauce for the ketchup i just dont care for ketchup except on fries or meatloaflol i will add some fresh pineapple chunks and maybe some sweet peppers for texture next time but overall this is a keeper as written
5,this was amazing i made it for my moms birthday tonight and she loved it too i did not have the chinese spice but it came out great anyways the sauce reminds me of the general tsos sauce which i love i will definitely make this again we were craving some asian food but with being in lock down due to the covid virus we dont venture out except for groceries so this hit the spot i will be sharing the link to this with my family and friends
5,i happened across this recipe a few years ago the entire family loves it the chinese spice gives it a distinctly asian flavor we like it over rice and garnished with green onion it is a meal in itself
5,i loved this chicken it was delicious and very simple to make my son and daughter also loved it unfortunately my hubby didnt like it so may not be able to make again until he goes out of town
5,delicious i used cider vinegar janet vfe
5,delicious made just like recipe except for the chinese spice since i do not have this will definitely make it again
5,awesome chicken dish i used boneless chicken thighs and followed the recipe otherwise it was so tender and the sauce was magnificent this is going on my definitely make again list
5,made with boneless chicken thighs and cooked them first in my sous vide and then followed recipe exactly dee licious picky husband raved about the wonderful flavor he even asked for leftovers in his lunch tomorrow
5,make a double batch at least these are super yummy making extra sauce would be a good idea also
5,incredible doubled the sauce left out the spice powder did not have any i will make this often so happy and impressed with how it turned out thank you for a great recipe
5,so amazing loved it down to the last drop of the delicious sauce a new family favorite i too used apple cider vinegar because i love the depth of flavor it adds
5,excellent and easy
5,very good and easy
5,what a hit i doubled the sauce and i was glad i did as it was delicious will be making again
5,delicious although i didnt havemake spice seasoning but it was still excellent also i used cup orange juice instead of water for extra flavor its a keeper
5,i followed the recipe but doubled the meat and tripled the sauce i used chicken breasts plus thighs and it turned out beautifully red and so delicious you could skip browning the meat because i dont think this could be less attractive or delicious
5,so good i made homemade bread bowls to go with this recipe knocks it out of the park love it
5,love love love this soup my family enjoys it as a meal very hearty dont let the use of velveta scare you it really works well the recipe is wonderful as written however i occasionally change things up for a slightly different taste my favourite is simply adding lb of ground beef instead of a lb and a little cajun seasoning tony chacheres or a can of rotel tomatoes for queso dip flavour kids really liked this
5,just made thisit is super delish made few add inschanges added a chicken bouillon sp cube and only tsp sea salt used oz extra sharp white cheddar which i grated only had oz in fridge plus i used cup milk and cup heavy cream crumbled bacon on top and added croutons my hubby added swirl of ketchup and chopped pickles so good people that made this and say it has no flavor put a bouillon cube in there every soup i make i add a cube i dont understand why ppl dont cook more with it it adds flavor just cut back on the salt that recipe calls for
5,this soup is absolutely delicious and one of our family favorites i do tweak this recipe to my familys taste i also made this soup in our church kitchen for wednesday night dinners and for special occasions serving our visiting ministers and it was definitely a thumbs up i highly recommend this recipe
5,this is the best soup i have ever made
5,this soup is excellent its quick and easy and very creamy will definitely make this again
5,very good soup and i will use the whole pound of ground beef and another lb of velvetta or other cheese that i may have on hand the next time around
5,i made this on a sat for people yr old grandson that doesnt eat veggies ask if it had carrots in it he went back for seconds and ask on sun if there was any left that he could have for supper on mon night i didnt have basil or parsley so left out used oz shredded mexican chees and oz shredded co jack instead of velveeta will be making this a lot this winter i used a full pound of hamb on mon i added a pint of home canned potato soup mix a little more cheese and sour cream so we could have three bowls potato soup mix is in a pint jar put pint jar chopped potatoes pint sliced carrots split the rest of the jar with a layer of chopped celery and chopped onions add teaspoon salt and fill with water pressure can at pounds for minutes this makes a pretty jar for a gift also put the instructions on itto use heat soup mix with tablespoon butter or marg and add one pint milk check the salt and add pepper if you like heat but dont boil if you need quarts just use the same proportions in a qt jar with teaspoon of salt and pressure at lbs for minutes you can also can just can potatoes or add onions to the potatoes for the same amount of time these are handy to fry or add to soup

5,i followed the recipe exactly and the chicken was delicious this was an easy meal to prepare and i will make it again and again thanks for sharing this recipe

5,i made exactly according to recipe except doubled sauce as he was eating hubby kept telling me how good it was perfect amount of red pepper flakes i would maybe not double the five spice powder will definitely make again served over brown rice
5,this is a great recipe bone in chicken thighs are always on sale and this is a great way to use them my family loves this dish i serve these with mushroom fried rice recipe from the toh site
5,this recipe is fantastic and easy to make i served asian peanut coleslaw with it
5,i made this recipe for my family and they truly enjoyed it i doubled sauce recipe and paired the chicken with an asian medley of veggies and some rice i also did not include the spice powder but it still turned out great my son has already requested that i make this again next week
5,family love it super easy and yummy next time i will try it with chicken breast as that is what my family prefers
5,easy to make omitted the fivespice because i didnt have it on hand but still very good
5,the only changes i made were using rice vinegar and omitting the spice powder and cornstarch as others commented it thickened up fine without it i also doubled the sauce which is a must to pour over the rice everyone loved it and wanted the recipe
5,my preschool aged children and husband liked this recipe i doubled the sauce ingredients and made thighs i did not need the cornstarch to thicken the sauce
5,phenomenal the sauce was very good and spiced just right with just a little bit of zing with the hot pepper we used penzeys chinese five spice powder we did not use but a pinch as penzeys tends to be very potent we will definitely make this dish againwe served this over rice noodles which grabbed the sauce and coated them just perfect
5,really good chicken i followed the recipe exactly except i reduced the red pepper flakes by half since my husband doesnt like spicy foods the sauce was a little greasy next time i will pour off the grease before adding the sauce and will double the sauce as other reviewers suggested
5,this was great my husband went back for thirdsthen asked if he could have the last bit of chicken still left too served with a side of sugar snap peas and fresh fruit
5,easy and tasty everyone loved it and will make again
5,made exactly as the recipe reads and it was delicious this one is a keeper my husband said i could make it again any time
5,both my husband and i really liked chicken i will make this again and add it to mylist of best chicken
5,i thought this was very good even though it was a little too spicy for my daughter i doubled the sauce ingredients and was glad that i did
5,quick easy and quite tasty if you are going to make or thighs i would at least double the sauce especially if you are going to serve withover rice i served with asian fried cabbage and plainno meat fried rice was all very easy and very good
5,this is a great asian dish you can use the sauce with chicken beef or pork add more red pepper flakes for gen tso of add sesame seeds for sesame chicken thank you so much for the recipe
5,did any one even try this recipe as is for the first time i think it is good just the way it is except perhaps for those who dont like it so spicyuse a bit less red pepper flakes
5,absolutely wonderful will definitely make again
5,amazing had it with mashed potatoes and oh boy it was a true hit
5,the whole family enjoyed this simple dish i used boneless skinless chicken breast cut into cubes and served it over quinoa with broccoli florets as a side
5,this recipe rivals any chinese restaurant made with boneless chicken thighs and served on a bed of rice and oriental steamed veggies amazing definitely double the sauce it is that good no need to thicken
5,this was absolutely a hit the orange juice and the red pepper flakes made it so i also added some fresh orange zest to the pot and im looking forward to sharing this with other friends and family dont like the kick just use less
5,so good i had to use chicken legs and wings because it is what i had and i did not skin them but other then that i fallowed the recipe as is except in the end i didnt need the cornstarch it had cooked down and thickened so well on its own that no more thickening was needed someone posted about keeping this handy in the fridge i agree never again will i purchase teriyaki sauce i can see this sauce replacing several i keep on hand and i can see using it in oh so many various ways to many to mention thank you mr dave farrington of midwest city oklahoma for this recipe best recipe of this nature i have found to date
5,really good the whole family loves this dish i did triple the recipe as other reviewers mentioned because i was cooking thighs but only used times the amount of brown sugar it was perfect thickened on its own didnt need the cornstarch i cooked it in the morning to the point of adding sauce and simmering for minutes let it cool down and refrigerated then cooked for the rest of the cooking time just before dinner i didnt use the five spice and it was great without it
5,i made enough to serve and not a drop was left it was a huge hit with everyone they were already requesting that i make it again for them made me feel fantastic
5,everyone loved this recipe i cooked as directed added it to the crockpot until i was finished with the rest of dinner served over rice and broccoli on the side next time i will brown the meat and add to crock pot t finish cooking i want to add orange zest next time as sharon said she did
5,i added chopped red onions amp fresh minced gingerroot so yummy would have liked more sauce for rice though
5,i made this and it was really really good i was missing the chinese spice but found it at amazon and have it on orderi tried it again this time with the chinese spice let me tell you right off that chinese spice is overwhelmingly potent next time i make it im only going to give a sprinkling of the spice i made it again tonight and left the chinese spice out completely i didnt have orange juice so i used lemon juice plus a lot of garlic it turned out so good i cannot rave more about the deliciousness of this recipe oh yes i added cup green pepper and cup chopped carrots just stir everything in the chicken and sauce recipe together cover and let simmer for mins delicious
5,excellent amp fast after reading the reviews i doubled the sauce ingredients i didnt have the chinese spice powder so substituted chinese cinnamon also we dont care for the dark meat of poultry so i used boneless skinless chicken breasts it was wonderful the only suggestion my family made was to cube the chicken i served it with wide rice noodles delicious
5,although i havent made this yet but one very similarmany of you say you cant find the spice seasoning i have use it for years and find it either in the normal spice section or the oriental and spanish food sections of the grocery stores stores i purchased from eastern us harris teeter whole foods kroger and oriental market stores brands were mccormick recent wfs badia amp goya in the hispanic section its a better buy in the oriental and hispanic sections also the ingredients vary slightly so read them an choose according to your personal tasteshope this helps
5,excellent my family enjoys it a lot i too leave out the spice powder i use orange juice concentrate for the orange juice and i have no problem with it thickening up on its own i did try cubing the chicken once but i thought it was better when i didnt i dont know what is so expensive about this recipe as mentioned in a previous post
5,made this tonight for dinner followed recipe exactly it was delicious served it with khorr assian riceamp sides and fresh fruit
5,made this today and it was deliciouslike the others no need to thicken the sauce think i will double the sauce next time
5,i will definitely make this again i had four thighs instead of five i wont use as much olive oil next time i didnt have green onions but had everything else i also agree that the cornstarch step wasnt really necessary although i did it to see what the results would beupdate i have made this recipe several times over the past couple years it is one of my favorites i usually make brown rice to go with it and steamed veggies such as broccoli or green beans i also agree that doubling the sauce is a good idea
5,i always prefer to use chicken thighs over chicken breasts because they are much more flavorful and moistthis recipe did not disappoint i like a lot of vegetables so i added some sautéed green pepper and red onion strips it was a tad more spicy than i am used too so i added a can of crushed pineapple with the juice and this cut back on the heat otherwise this recipe will definitely be at the front of my box especially since my husband enjoyed it
5,very moist chicken and tasty too i used orange marmelade instead of orange juice i did use the corn starch my family loves a thick sweet sauce this sauce would be great as an orange chicken meal or to use for stir fry the pineapple mentioned sounds like a good idea will have to try next time
5,i was really surprised by how much i liked this i usually have a thing about eating meat off the bone while i started my dinner carving off the chicken i quickly progressed to picking the thigh up for some seriously unladylike gnawing its that goodmy pickyeaters and ate it slowly but didnt complain which is highly unusual for a new flavor i will be making this again and again and again
5,excellent i used the juice of a whole orange instead of the cup water
5,just made this two nights ago and im making it again already so good better than chinese takeout and super easy i had everything but the chinese five spice powder so i substituted a spoon of hoison sauce like another member recommended and it was fantastic i cant wait for dinner tonight ha ha
5,have done this recipe twice and both times it was a big hit i did this for a small group about young adults working our church sports camp and they loved it i did it again for the owls older wiser loving saints at church and many asked for the recipe i couldnt find the chinese five spice powder so we didnt use it but it had a great taste thank you for these wonderful recipes
5,i love this recipe it is quick and is so yummy
5,excellent recipe will make over and over again
5,enjoyed this
5,the flavor was delicious and perfect with brown rice and some veggies
5,delicious i upped the broth since some thought it was too cheesy
5,excellent the only change i made was substituted oz sharp cheddar cheese with oz velveeta instead of all oz velveeta this one is a keeper
5,this is great soup it has everything in it my husband loves and he requests it over and over
5,i made a double batch and my husband and i loved it
5,i made this soup and it is yummy
5,definite keeper my family loved this soup and it will be made again
5,i added bacon
5,i made this the other day and my whole family loved it thank you for sharing it
5,my husband and i loved this soup i did make some adjustments though i only put in cups of potatoes instead of and oz of cheese instead of excellent taste
5,this is by far one of the most delicious soups i have made i didnt have velvetta cheese so used cheese whiz the sour cream makes the soup adds a nice finish to the already great soup i will make this often more of a meal than just a soup
5,my family and i love this recipe so much i have shared it with my older sister and her granddaughter said that it was from heaven thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us
5,a new family favorite
5,this is so good i doubled the sauce and that was perfect
5,this is one of the best dishes i have ever made my boyfriend really enjoyed it and has asked me to make it again already and we only just had it two nights ago its will definitely be a regular dish where he is such a picky eater definitely one of my favorites
5,this chicken is shockingly good im usually a white meat kinda girl but had thighs that i needed to cook i happened to have all the ingredients and tada its to die for i didnt change a thing
5,love this recipe a lot of flavour and taste just as good as a leftover
5,i love this recipe i make it all the time i made it completely following the recipe the first time and loved it from then on i added my own twists i cook the chicken in a pan first to get a good golden crust on it then throw in some onions and the garlic from the recipe let that cook and then throw in the sauce for the recipe i allow that to cook on its own for a bit then add the chicken and let that finish cooking then serve also i felt the sauce was a little sweet for my taste so instead of ketchup i used kochu jeng add a little lime on top and its so good
5,this was definitely a winnder and a hit it was so good that i licked the plate cleaned kudos
5,have no doubtthis is really really good i served with rice and stir fried baby bok choy with radishes yum
5,i made this for the first time and me and my boyfriend loved it i will be adding it to my goto recipes
5,wonderful i didnt have any chinese fivespice powder so i added a spoonful of hoisin sauce
5,this is an excellent recipe i did double the sauce because we like to have extra to dip our egg rolls i didnt have orange juice but actually prefer orange rum in a few other asian recipes and it was perfect in this other than that i followed the recipe exactly this is definitely a keeper but when i make it in the future i will make a popcorn style chicken by dipping chunks of chicken in egg white and dusting with corn starch and frying until crisp and golden and then following the rest of the recipe this will be just like the chicken you find at a mall food court or chinese buffet
5,yummy i thought there was lots of sauce l didnt thicken it though i would use half the amount of oil in the future
5,delicious the spice powder is optional but really does add to the flavor i found that the sauce simmered down enough that i didnt need to thicken it with cornstarch
5,my teenage granddaughter made this with me and we both loved it same experience as others though that no thickeing was needed sauce simmered down to thickness without cornstarch we will definitely make it again
5,i made this last night with boneless chicken thighs doubled the sauce added asian chili sauce we like things spicy in our family didnt cook as long since there was no bone didnt do the cornstarchwater at end it was already thickened served with stir fried vegetables and asian noodles the family loved it there was not a piece of chicken left definitely a new favorite
5,made this for my family and they wouldnt stop raving
5,a huge hit with my picky kids
5,delicious and very easy to prepare i used boneless chicken thighs and that sped up the cooking time a bit
5,very good my year old even liked it said it was a keeper
5,the family loved this my husband suggested using chicken breast next time
5,ive been making this for a while its a keeper
5,my family loved this recipe i made it less than a week ago and am making it again because it was such a hit
5,the family loves this recipe i use boneless chicken thighs and add asian chili sauce and double the sauce also add onions
5,i found this recipe over a year ago my family loves it i even keep the sauce recipe handy to use with a teriyaki salmon we makeits better than from a bottle yum
5,very tasty will use chicken breasts
5,this recipe was a great introduction to the asian five spice powder it seems to add so many great flavors that i could never seem to capture
5,excellent recipe need to convert all my recipes to gluten free due to allergy this worked wonderfully for that used gf flour tsp xanthan gum and cup sour cream added for the fat to help gf flour work more efficiently otherwise no changes great texture taste and appeal thanks for posting this recipe
5,i have been making these for about years so easymoistnow my daughter makes them
5,killer recipe right amount of everything made to raise money for our american legion on their spaghetti night not a crumb left
5,this is a great recipe bulletproof for swaps and adds not to be that guy but i swapped half the flour for almond flour and used splenda instead of sugar use half the amount of splenda that the recipe calls for or youll be sorry then i added walnuts and cranberries and a scoop of pb
5,ive been making this for years perfect recipe and family favorite the only thing i am doing different is substituting cups of fresh roasted pureed pumpkin out of this world
5,this recipe is great i did substitute applesauce for the oil and i added some miniature chocolate chips to my second batch my sister that doesnt cook at all made them and they turned out wonderful everyone loves them
5,the whole family loves these
5,a crowd pleaser moist and delicious im a sucker for pumpkin spice so i added tsp ground ginger tsp ground clove great with or without nuts but i couldnt resist folding in cup toasted pecans
5,pi made these today they were like a moist cake not what i would consider bars flavor was very balanced not strong pumpkin and not strong cinnamon definitely chill before serving to firm up the bake i will probably use a different cream cheese frosting recipe with less sugar first pumpkin of the season and these were a gentle start ive never made a taste of home recipe that wasnt good p
5,these bars are a family favorite and ive been making them for years i like to add raisins or chocolate chips
5,made to take to work everyone loved them
5,this is one of our very favorite recipes we like to double the sauce ingredients and serve fresh steamed broccoli on the side
5,this is a hit everytime i make it ive given it to my sister who now also makes it often we both sometimes use chicken breasts instead of thighs
5,this has become a favorite dish in my household i make egg foo yong casserole along with it as a great companion side dish the whole house smells wonderful and my son cant wait for dinnerlol
5,this was so easy to make the kitchen smelled heavenly and the end result was ever so good this will go in my frequent flyer recipe book for sure
5,a very moist cake and with canned pumpkin i always keep this in my pantry for a quick make any time of year
5,i love it i shared it with my neighbors ill definitely make it again
5,great moist everyone liked them
5,this recipe is fantastic the cake part was very moist and thick the frosting was delicious and not too sweet my sister loved it and shes not even a fan of pumpkin recommend
5,i bake all the time and the kids are always asking me for something i tried these and now i have a new most requested desert thanks for the wonderful and easy to make dessert so moist simply delicious
5,these were probably the best thing ive ever made and im a big baker i used about more cinnamon less oil and baked about minutes longerbut ovens do vary delish
5,i dont know where this recipe originated but i double checked its exactly the same one i have been making for forty years its moist its delicious some folks have commented that its not chewy no its not its not supposed to be its not exactly a cake either it cuts into neat bars my family loves them i bake it in a x x pan it comes out perfectly the only thing i add is a pinch of cloves delicious and reliable
5,i msde this minus canola oil using cup of homemade applesauce it is moist and delicious beyond belief
5,moist and delicious best ever pumpkin bars
5,i love these bars i make them every fall at the request of my kids and cousins my mom always made these for me and my sister when we were growing up and well into our adulthood a true staple of the season
5,i made these for thanksgiving a few years ago with great success i used melted unsalted butter in lieu of the oil in the cake this recipe is perfect if you know how to follow simple instructions and use the right size pan the frosting was just right and the cake was light moist and fluffy it was a huge hit thanks toh
5,my favorite soooo good
5,these were a huge hit in my house really good
5,this bar was wonderful and the whole family loved it i added dark raisins and just a touch of pumpkin spice
5,yummy alternative for people like me who dont like pumpkin pierecipe is too sweet though i halved the sugar for the bars and added more cream cheese to the icing plus i did half wholewheat flour which i may do only wholewheat flour next time also i may reduce the amount of oil next time or use butter as they seemed a bit weighed down by oil still though super yummy
5,my family loves these i have to make them every thanksgiving
5,long before the internet my mom cut this recipe out of a magazine thats over years ago ive been using it forever last year i typed the recipe from moms clipping and combined two lines this morning i pulled the recipe from my computer and it was wrong cup oil and no sugar i looked on taste of home and there it was one cup oil and cups sugar this recipe is wonderful just the right amount of sweetness and well worth being available for more than years btw i add raisins to the batter and chopped walnuts sprinkled on the frosting
5,made this for the first time last night everyone thought it was like pumpkin pie but better also frosting recipe is a keeper will not buy premade anymore i did split this up into two smaller baking dishes since i didnt have a big one available it took mins each the batter was about an inch high but rose into a cake i would suggest that if the recipe is not changed it is called pumpkin cake instead of bars fortunately i found that i prefer the cake
5,these were delicious i added tsp vanilla to the batter and i used tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon i did not add dates or nuts i baked it for about min everyone loved them
5,i am giving these stars and havent even made them yet i make something similar using three jars of baby food carrots in place of pumpkin and cup more oil and they are to die for they are probably a brighter orange than pumpkin bars i bake them in a sheet cake pan which makes them more like bars i also use the whole oz of cream cheese and a whole stick of butter in the icing sticking to the cups of sugar which means that they would be slightly less sweet the frosting just covers themto the person who asked about a substitute for cannola oil you can use any kind of oil except for olive my favorite is safflower oil but i warn you that it is expensive i love it in salad dressings and have used it in my carrot bars it is very light
5,so delicious taste as good as they look
5,so delicious i made these last night and brought them to work they were gone in about an hour
5,made these for a reunion and everyone loved them
5,these bars were the so delicious they were super easy to make and so quick because the measurements were easy i made it exactly as the recipe called for and they came out light and fluffy not exactly like cake but cakey all of my kids raced and raced about them
5,easy and always a crowdpleaser

5,i make quantities of this recipe amp freeze for me amp giftsthats how good it is
5,made it for a gathering and received rave reviews from everyone
5,a favorite in our house i have been making it for years if i bring it somewhere i have to share the recipe its a keeper i sub out a little of the cheese for a spicy cheese such as pepper jack or hot habanero and add a little bacon
5,i make this with cheddar not velveeta
5,just made this tonightim writing this between bites of my second bowlthe empty bowls from the kids says it all delicious period
5,i have been making this for years and have received many compliments and requests for the recipe
5,ive been making this soup for over years its delicious but my original recipe i printed from this website calls for oz of velveeta i think when its made with more velveeta it tastes grainy i also always use lb of ground beef usually im cooking for a large crowd so it goes farther
5,i followed the recipe as written it was delicious a new family favorite
5,we loved this i added a few dashes of texas pete hot sauce to give it a little more pizazze but otherwise made as directed will save and make again
5,love this soup and do share the recipe with everyone i serve it to i find its a great way to use up leftover pot roast
5,family loved the recipe and i served it in the bread bowls from this site thank you for sharing we used reall cheese instead of the velveeta
5,my kids loved this soup i have to admit though i did take a shortcut to make this a meal i could whip up after work i substituted the prep work and cooking veggies with two cans of vegall it was really good
5,absolutely love this recipe so quick and easy to make yummmmmmmyyyyy
5,my family loved these pumpkin bars
5,i have made these bars since the recipe was published in the country magazine back in i am always asked to make the recipe for gatherings and to make more they are moist and delicious
5,i got this recipe from a taste of home site over years ago it is a family favorite and often requested so easy to put together only change i have made is a little more spice i add some nutmeg and a pinch of clove great anytime of year
5,these pumpkin bars are so good when i made them though i used cups of fresh sugar pie pumpkin from my garden instead of canned pumpkin i think it tastes so much better with fresh pumpkin and it is also organic and environmentally friendly
5,these are absolutley delicious and a really easy recipe to follow my mom used to make pumkin bars every fall and i always looked forward to it as a kid my mom has sinced passed away and i couldnt find the recipe for them i stumbled upon this one and it tastes exactly like the kind she used to make i will definetely use this recipe over and over
5,i would like to know if these will freeze well thanks
5,great easy recipe to make these tasted excellent and were not dry at all
5,very moist amp delicious more like a cake than a bar
5,besttasting bars ever theyre only bars cuz they turn out that way if you cut them right but the taste is wonderful i used regular betty crocker cream cheese icing didnt have time to make my own and they were a huge hit at thanksgiving now i make it every year for a nd dessert at christmas time
5,these pumpkin bars are a constantly requested dessert for work home amp bake sales moist flavorful i do use my own recipe for the frosting but the bars are delicious
5,excellent i am going to add some walnuts or pecans next time making these scrumptious bars thanks for recipe
5,very good recipe everyone loves these bars i tweaked it by adding pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon and have used oz cream cheese in frostingyum
5,i have used this recipe for years and never make pumpkin pie any more everyone likes this much better i use a large can of pumpkin and twice the cinnamon it makes the bars more moist they are even better the day after they are made as the flavor is even richer
5,my grandson says tasty yummy and very delicious
5,anyone who says this is dry or greasy im sorry but you must not have followed the recipe i have made this several times and it is a huge hit delicious and moist my only change is that i use the whole oz brick of cream cheese in the frosting love this will make this every year
5,these are wonderful they are light airy moist and very flavorful i add about tsp of pumpkin spice i also cheat by using canned whipped white frosting on them i dont like cream cheese frosting my year old son loves them he said can i just stick my whole face into the pan lol
5,absolutely fabulous moist and delicious these were amazing
5,delicious most of the time i dont add the frosting which allows me to eat more without the added calories also add extra cinnamon and will try the suggestion of using splenda
5,i made these exactly as the recipe reads and they were fabulous my husband and four kids couldnt get enough everyone complains about the oil but i have another recipe that takes cup of butter so i am not sure why it is a big deal these taste great and keep well if you happen to have leftovers my mom has made pumpkin roll for years and honestly i have gotten tired of it so this year i am making these
5,love these barsmade for church for a fund raiser and they sold right away
5,these are fabulous we love pumpkin and these were easy and moist
5,we made these with our own home grown pumpkin in march in place of the cup of oil we used cup canola oil and cup applesauce came out great probably could have used the whole ounces of cream cheese a little more frosting would be good but a very nice recipe overall cream cheese frosting is always a hit
5,i have made these for years they are so simple and always moist and delicious i follow the recipe exactly and they always get rave reviews and want the recipe if your in a hurry a can of cream cheese frosting works well also
5,amazing very moist i used cool whip cream cheese frosting but sadly they have discontinued it
5,i made this cake last night as my son has been requesting a pumpkin based dessert im not a big fan of pumpkin pie so decided to try this instead this turned out fantastic i followed the recipe exactly what i like about this cake is that its not overly sweet the frosting was easy to make i didnt have a whole oz pack of cream cheese only about half left over i made the frosting with that it turned out great the frosting was a thin layer due to my shortage of cream cheese but it was just finei am not a baker but this was a very easy recipe to follow i might add pumpkin seeds or sun flower seeds with raisins to it next time
5,this recipe was so easy to make the family thought it was great
5,easy and super delicious
5,these were super easy to make however and i followed the recipe exactly using the pan size recommended mine were ready to come out of the oven at minutes at i am glad i checked the time my sister makes this recipe often and it is now one of my favorites also thank you
5,the ingredients are exactly the same as the pumpkin rolls i make every year except this seems like a lot less trouble no jelly roll pan no rolling into powdered sugared towel no chance its going to crack as you roll it up etc etc definitely gonna give it a try
5,very good for those of you that want to substitute apple sauce for some of the oil remember to use only unsweetened applesauce as sweetened applesauce will add more sugar and make the bars too moist
5,i used coconut oil instead of canola oil super good everyone loved them
5,this recipe was absolutely fabulous
5,this recipe was terrific very easy to put together my husband daughter amp mom are diabetic i substituted splenda for the sugar in both the cake and icing and it was delicious my nondiabetics loved it too my soninlaw asked me times if i was sure that his wife could eat it this is definitely going into the family cookbook
5,if you ever need a large amount of bars for a large group this is it it not only taste good you get a lot of bars
5,i have been making this exact recipe for years it is excellent it irritates me someone would give it a star rating based on buying a cake mix and adding a can of pumpkin to it rate the recipe not your version
5,very easy to put together i greased the cookie sheet and put parchment paper on top of it inside the cookie sheet it was a little tricky taking it out of the pan but i would do it the same way next time i had some leftover coconut pecan frosting which i used in place of the cream cheese frosting delicious
5,yummyi am a single senior lady so i cut it in half then i froze the rest for more meals i also substituted white cheddar and mozarella instead of velveta
5,sabrossimo
5,the best cheeseburger soup ever i substituted homemade velveeta for storebought and white wholewheat flour for the ap my bunch demolished the entire pot so next time ill double the recipe
5,used small red potatoes added and extra cup of broth doubled the meat to lb and left off the carrots super yummy
5,my family loved this soup easy to prepared the soup was full bodied creamy and delicious i normally do not use velveeta in anything but in this soup it was perfect
5,as we prepared to spend the last part of a frigid christmas day watching our steelers and eagles play i wanted something comforting and easy for dinner and this was it absolutely delicious only adaptation i made was using beef broth instead of chicken broth because that is what i had on hand this has already been added to my recipe blog
5,my friend shared this recipe with me a decade ago and it is still a family favorite it is now a football favorite too i make this to sell at our concession stand it always sells out
5,since i live alone this makes a more soup than i can use at once i didnt like it frozen i have found that if i make the basenot the cheese and freeze it into or bowls i can then just thaw one of these and add the cheese then
5,my family loved this soup it was very filling and easy to put together i used the frozen cubed hash brown potatoes which was a huge time saver i too used beef broth and two cans cheddar soup since it was what i had on hand instead of velveetaquick easy and delicious
5,i used this recipe as a guide i had to remove the carrots as some of family do not like cooked carrots so i added corn instead i also added a tsp of worcestershire sauce and cup of red wine the alcohol cooks out leaving more of a rich flavor to the meat
5,a staple in our home freezes well and everyone loves it
5,excellent both my guys hubby and dad liked it i used almond milk and added a bit of shedded cheddar as i was a bit short on velveetawill definitely make again
5,we love anything made with pumpkin at my house i made these bars added a tablespoon of molasses and a teaspoon of vanilla so good the kids will have a great treat after school today
5,sooooooo delicious and soooo easy however i used a full oz block of cream cheese and a whole stick of butter then adjusted sugar to desired consistency with no need for any milk just vanilla wonderful recipe definitely a keeper
5,i have made this recipe several times my husband likes it very much as do my children and grandchildren the icing recipe that i use calls for oz cream cheese stick of butter cups of confectioners sugar and tsp of vanilla i have considered using pumpkin pie spice but so far have stuck with the cinnamon very moist and delicious
5,i have been making these bars for about years and my family and friends love them the only difference in my recipe is that i add c chopped walnuts to the batter and instead of the cream cheese frosting i make orange frosting t melted butter c powdered sugar t grated orange peel and enough juice from one orange for spreading consistency both are good my family just prefers the fresh orange flavor
5,i have made these bars for over years and my family and friends love them for the last or so years i have been putting orange frosting c melted butter c powdered sugar t grated orange peel and enough juice from one orange for spreading consistency both are delicious but we like the orange frosting even better than the cream cheese
5,wonderful flavor and texture substitute a teaspoon of maple syrup or the vanilla for a subtle bling
5,absolutely delicious and so easy to make will definitely be making again great recipe d
5,my family and friends all loved this recipe i am going to make cupcakes for my kindergarten class at thanksgiving
5,made these and they were a hit have shared recipe with others already will make again very soon
5,so good could not stop eating them so bad good thing i gave some away used the pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon they were very tasty and moist i will make again and try the orange icing thank you for the recipe
5,excellent the best pumpkin bars i have ever made i added about one tablespoon of grated orange rind in the frosting which we liked very much
5,i loved this recipe it was easy had everything on hand and turned out great will be making them again for sure
5,light and well balanced ingredients i always double the recipe
5,i agree with everyone else this is very moist and delicious will definitely be keeping this recipe

5,i have been making these bars for yearstoday when i wanted a pumpkin recipe this is the first one i thought of my whole family loves themand so does everyone else
5,i have made these a few times now and they are very good the cream cheese frosting is perfect
5,this is the best pumpkin bar recipe ive used i like this recipe because it uses an entire can of pumpkin a lot of recipes use part of a can and i end up trashing the rest also the frosting is super easy to make and overly sweet its a perfect compliment to the pumpkin
5,absolutely delicious and a complete hit when i made them to take to a party i had to double the icing thoughid like to find a substitute for the vegetable oil as one cup seems like an awful lot

5,everyone loved it will make it again
5,this soup is so good we fix it for those cold days we love it
5,great cheeseburger soup easy to follow directions and great for a cold day
5,very good soup i did half of the recipe for my husband and i and it was the perfect amount for us to eat once with leftovers a couple of timesi left out the jalapeno peppers since we do not like spicy food i also kept it in the crock pot for a couple of hours on warm since i needed to make the meal a while before we would be able to eat turned out great
5,this was excellent makes a large batch so i froze half of it to enjoy later did not change a thing delicious as written
5,omg this hearty soup is the bomb it is easy to cut the recipe in half for a smaller quantity creamy mushroomy with a hint of heat my husband added hot sauce for that extra umph love love love this soup
5,yummy my whole family loved them and requested i make more amp soon
5,i made these last night and took to work today everyone went crazy about them they said they were the best and some wanted the recipe
5,these were so moist and delicious to give them a little more bite add a little pumpkin pie spice to the recipe these wont stay in the pan long
5,i brought them to work and everyone loved them they are easy to make they come out very moist they have a mild spice flavor i think next time i will add a little more spice or some pumpkin pie spice as suggested by previous reviewer other wise they are great
5,i have made these bars two times already im making another batch tomorrowevery one loved themthe next batch are mine
5,we have made this soup or times now and it is soooo good we usually omit the jalapenos because of the grandkids but definitely a keeper
5,i tried this and it is amazing i am pregnant and i know the baby loves it already
5,excellent my family loved it i didnt put mushrooms in it though
5,i have made this recipe for years now i got this recipe from the original magazine it came out in my whole family loves it even our daughter since she was old enough to eat it has ate every bite we do leave the mushrooms out since i am not a big fan its the first thing we make once it gets cold
5,everyone raved about this soup at deer camp men and women very satisfying
5,very good there were no leftovers
5,very good recipe i made a couple modifications thoughi didnt add any mushroomsi didnt use any butter since the beef had enough fati used a stick blender on the soup before i added the ground beefi didnt use any flour to thicken the soup as the potatoes thickened it enoughand finally i added a little pickle juice to the soupthat really added something that was missing
5,oh my yummy this soup is a winner i did make a few changes i forgot to buy carrots so i didnt add that only added about half the mushrooms not a huge mushroom fan and i would chop them really small next time and used generous cups of sharp cheddar instead of velveeta personal preference the leftovers are just as amazing i will definitely be making this again probably with bread bowls next time mmmmm
5,winter comfort in a bowlloved this soup better than a previous recipe id tried too i didnt add the mushrooms green pepper or jalapenos and did a bit less milk at the end it seemed to need some herbs so i added a bit of dill and parsley and then it was perfect
5,can you freeze this
5,yum
5,my husband and i really liked this soup i added a few red pepper flakes to give it a little zing and was good might try and add some ground sausage to it next time
5,i used a full pound of ground beef and no velvettacheddar cheese and c cream cheese instead it seemed to lack flavor until i added a pinch of red pepper flakes some worcestershire sauce and a good teaspoon of bacon grease i know i knowbut it needed something after those were added it tasted great the next time ill saute the vegetables in a bit of bacon grease andor crumble some cooked bacon on the top who doesnt love a bacon cheeseburger
5,i have been making this soup since it was first published in the only changes i make are to use a full pound of ground beef and american cheese rather than velveeta i also sometimes add more chicken broth to thin it out a bit definite winner for my husband
5,i loved it only used half the cheese and milk
5,this was a terrific dish my entire family loved it i used full pound of hamburger instead of pound
5,this soup is one of our favorites i make it often in the winter if there are any leftovers which is rare i put it in individual servings in the freezer for a quick lunch the only change i make is that i add a full pound of hamburger the carrots onions and celery give the soup a great flavor i thought the basil was different but it is excellent in the soup the amount of cheese is just right as it is not overly cheesy i will definitely keep making this soup
5,this is one of our favorite soups so delicious and if there are any leftovers they are just as good if not better than the first time around
5,absolutely delicious perfect snow day recipe
5,so full of flavor i double the amount of cheese onions and hamburger
5,i have been making this very versatile recipe for a couple decades my favorite version is replacing the potatoes with cauliflower pulled apart in similar size pieces with the stems cut up also i chop up fresh parsley to cup real cheddar instead of velveeta replace burger with cubed ham but just as good without meat at all
5,great recipe but i think the skewers are a miss i get the pickle and onion connection but not this way
5,made this for the first time last week and it was absolutely delicious i doubled the recipe and it was gone in no time i cant wait to take it to our next soup supper at my church i will make sure to have copies of the recipe with me as i am sure that there will be many requests for it
5,try thickening soup with mashed potato flakes instead if flour thats how i thicken my potato soup and cream of broccoli soup and this one i always keep an extra pouch or box of mashed potatoes for this then there is no flour taste
5,the best recipe for this soup love it
5,great recipe the ingredients in this soup work together perfectly the carrots onions and celery are what give the soup a great flavor but still i made a couple of my own changes im not a velveeta fan so i used even amounts of cheddar and american cheese any combination of cheeses you like would work i used a pound of ground beef and as someone suggested i added just a splash of worcestershire sauce this delicious recipe is a keeper
5,love this soup on a cold day for more flavor cook your bacon about a pound set aside save some of the dripping to cook the beef amp mushrooms in season with your favorite taco seasoning i add the mushrooms when the beef is almost done when the beef and mushrooms are done crumble and add the bacon always a favorite in the fall and winter
5,i am gluten free and i use a all purpose gf flour or just rice flour
5,everyone in my family loves this soup i did not have beef bouillon so i substituted it with an envelope of beefy onion soup mix and cooked it with my ground beef a definate winner

5,weve loved this soup my husband who is not a soup fan raves over this recipe and he and our year old will play fight for the leftovers this makes a very generous helping oh its even better the next couple days as leftovers warms up great
5,i made this for a girlscousins get together yesterday there was also chili some spicy chicken taco soup and some corn chowderthis was the biggest hit
5,this soup is amazing we have leftovers in the frig right now you can double easily for a crowd i threw in a couple of handfuls of elbow macaroni also i got it from my daughters friend jill i sometimes premake the first part waiting on adding the potatoes until serving day most of the prep work is done that way and you bring up to a boil throw in potatoes finish with the cheese milk etc excellent
5,i love this soup i like to add some chopped up dill pickle spears really makes it taste like a cheeseburger
5,flexible i skipped the carrots and celery cause im not a fan of those flavours and opted for mushrooms and broccoli instead i used duck fat in lieu of butter and duck stock in lieu of chicken because thats what i have i used whatever cheese was in my fridge left over taco mix and cheddar it was still delicious i love a recipe thats easy to adapt thank you
5,this is very good i cut up
5,hey edward go get your seeingeye dog and have him read the recipe for you sour cream is the last ingredient listed this is a great recipe soup is wonderful

5,i made this for dinner it was wonderful and tastes just like a cheeseburger
5,i made this a couple of weeks ago minus the celery and it was wonderful even the husband liked it thanks for sharing this great recipe

5,i love this recipe the flavor is delicious to madelyn below who wondered if anyone has used another cheese other than velveeta i did i cubed up cheddar cheese i did not like it as well i didnt like the texture and the flavor was a little different i am sticking with velveeta
5,been using this recipe for over five years best ever started out following recipe then changed have put in chocolate chips left out nuts when did use nuts it was mostly pecans and just lightly put sugar on bottom and sides not too many changes because it is great as is i just made another copy of recipe
5,the best banana nut bread ever the only change that i made was the nuts i put the whole cup in the batter but didnt put any on the top until i glazed the loaves and then i only sprinkled a few utterly delicious
5,this is an excellent banana bread easy to assemble and delicious will definitely be making this again i had about a half of cup of chocolate chips that i threw in as well the hint of chocolate with the orange sauce was awesome
5,i followed the recipe exactly and its delicious with pleasing texture and flavor i have a favorite banana bread recipe that i have used for years but i like this one because it is less sweet i am partial to orange flavor so the orange glaze really put this bread over the top beverly i live in ellicott city so were practically neighbors thank you for an excellent recipe
5,excellent recipe i add tsp banana extract and reduce the sugar to cup to release the bread from the pans i place wax paper to fit the bottom grease the wax paper and sprinkle cinnamonsugar on the paper dont grease the sides so that the batter can rise to its maximum while the pans are still warm not hot run a knife along the sides turn out the loaves on a cooling rack i do not use the glaze i use two x pans and bake all my dessert breads at degrees
5,just finished making this for the first time and it is perfect by far the best banana bread ive eaten and the glaze makes it all that much better definitely replacing my old banana bread recipe with this one
5,ive made this bread numerous times now and it is the best banana bread ive eva eaten i havent even made wsauce yet and its still the best
5,this banana bread is easily the best ive ever had the glaze adds sweetness and texture i think this will become my goto recipe vfe
5,i substituted cup of light brown sugar for cup of white sugar i also toasted the pecans before chopping and adding to the batter i did not use the glaze this is a very moist and dense cake very very happy with this recipe
5,best banana nut bread ever
5,ive been making this recipe for plus years its great and always turns out great
5,never made banana nut bread with a glaze my husband like it better so ill be making this one again thanks for sharing the recipe
5,this banana bread is outstanding i use walnuts instead of pecans and i mix them in completely instead of saving half for the top the orange glase is just right to set off the banana flavor thank you for this recipe ive made it several times and have it saved several places electronically plus in hard copy
5,got this going in the oven now i have made this in the past and it doesnt last long around here i use a bundt pan to cook it in and comes out great
5,im so glad i tried this bread absolutely delicious
5,delicious it is moist i love the orange glaze and the best is it makes loaves
5,i have made this recipe quite a few times and every time i make it my girls curse me a plenty all the while gobble gobble chunk by chunk it is a fabulous recipe i usually bake it in four small bread pans rather than the two larger onesmy only change to this recipe is to pan roast the pecans up frontfull disclosurei usually eat one of the small loaves by myself before it has time to cool then i take my insulin
5,this is an excellent recipe the only modifications that i made were i used cup of sugar instead of cups i used five very ripe bananas instead of about i used cup of walnuts instead of cups of pecans i also waited a good minutes for the loaves to cool down before putting the glaze over them as some reviewers have mentioned it made a huge difference i am planning on bringing one loaf to work on monday lets spread the joy delicious
5,never turning back best banana bread ever
5,outstanding i made the special banana nut bread and didnt change or modify anything about it the recipe made two full loaves we ate one gave the other away it was moist flavorful and didnt disappoint my sisterinlaw the recipient of the giveaway has many banana bread recipes but a few days later she said it was the best banana bread shes ever eaten and said shes throwing out all her other recipes the orange juice glaze gave it a great punch thank you for this recipe this ones a keeper
5,i dont know what that woman did but i have been making this for years so yummy and it is gone in about hours thank goodness it makes a second loaf freezes great too my husband and teenage boys beg me to make this one a regular basis if they would stop eating the bananas i do not use the glaze
5,ive made banana bread for years and this is the best ive ever tasted my friends loved it also
5,loved this with the touch of orange made it different than the basic banana nut breads i also read the recipe wrong and put all of the pecans into the batter and had to add more to the top not a problem for me
5,this is delicious it is the best banana bread recipe i have foundthe orange glaze on top makes it really special
5,this is very good i left off the glaze used walnuts instead of pecans and reduced the sugar to c very moist and more dense which we liked will definitely be a regular treat
5,very moist and delicious will definitely make again but would pierce the crust prior to putting on the glaze so it get down into the bread
5,made for teachers along with several other banana bread recipes and this was the first thing gone very delicious
5,i made this banana bread about a week ago as something to nice to give my neighbor and i kept one loaf for my family all who tried it loved it the bread didnt make it in my home past breakfast and my neighbor asked for the recipe i have tried many recipes for banana bread and this is by far my favorite
5,i love this recipe it is so moist and delicious ive made several banana nut bread recipes over the years and this one is the very best thank you taste of home
5,stars this is the best banana bread so moist and i have made it multiple times
5,this is great and requested lots by family members i do not make the glaze when i make it the bread does not need it this bread is so moist only recipe i use
5,this bread is wonderful i wanted to try it out so i only made recipe just a note the full recipe calls for cups of sugar i halved the recipe and used about cup of sugar it is plenty sweet next time i will make two loaves thanks for the great recipe
5,i made large and small muffins and how moist and flavorful they are amazing i cut back the sugar to one cup rather then two would have been way too sweet for me next time i am going to try cup of sugar its just a matter of tasting the batter and if it needs more add it i always under estimate the sugar and it usually works for me if your having a party try the mini cup or the regular cup cake pans these will be the hit of the party you cant go wrong with the recipe
5,took one loaf to work and it disappeared immediately and lots of compliments this is definitely a keeper the orange glaze really gives it something extra this will be my banana bread recipe from now on
5,i just love this recipe i dont ever make the glaze its so yummy who needs it my one change is that i use glazed pecans like pecan pie glazed or honey glazed that i chop rather than plain pecans
5,amazing banana bread although i do replace half the white sugar with brown sugar and i omit the nuts and orange glaze
5,this is an amazing recipe dont know what i liked more the cream cheese or the orange glaze yum

5,ive made this cheesecake several times and i love it and have always gotten rave reviews it is quite a bit of work but i find it most worth it i do use a larger springform pan
5,its been awhile since i made this cheesecake but its amazing just cant remember if you have to take creme out of oreo cookies before crushing for the crust
5,i made a few substitutions which created a lovely taste sensation first i made a crushed pretzel thins and butter crust second i substituted c caramel ice cream topping and c chocolate syrup for the reserved c filling in place of the fudge topping finally i chopped reeses cups and put them in the vanilla batter none on top did it turn out you bet it did and it was fabulous
5,yummy i just made this for a christmas party i did add some creamy pb to the main batter after removing the cup that is mixed with the fudge i also replaced some of the graham cracker crumbs for more oreo crumbs just to make it a little more chocolatey i had no problem with too much batter as one review stated and i used a springform so delicious one of my new favorites
5,i make this for many charity auctions its a big ticket item the most it has sold for is s
5,this is amazing i used reeses oreos hubby loves it
5,made it for my coworkers and everyone loved it it wasnt hard to make at all i used a x pan instead of a springform pan and it was excellent im making this for the holidays
5,this cheesecake was delicious made it according to the recipe with the exception of the chocolate cookies used chocolate wafers instead of sandwich cookies and it worked like a dream brought it to work and theres nothing left but crumbs
5,i doubled the recipe and made it in a xinch pan i needed to make it glutenfree so i used only gf graham crumbs increasing the amount to total both kinds of crumbs instead of hot fudge topping stirred into the chocolate layer i melted dark chocolate into some milk and stirred it into of the batter i left plain and i stirred the peanut butter into the other i layered them in the pan chocolate on bottom plain in the middle and pb on top i baked it about an hour and minutes tomorrow ill melt chocolate in milk again and put it on top as a ganache with pb cups chopped on top i used the recipe on this page to make gf pb cups i actually had some crumbs left over from doubling the recipe so i made a tiny cheesecake in a grabit dish and sampled it delicious
5,omg so easy and so delicious this was my first time to make cheesecake i was scared but it was so simple and tasted fabulous def will make it again and again
5,made this recipe exactly as written for a graduation party it was a huge hit and was gone in no time wouldnt change a thing
5,very easy and delicious it was a big hit at our bbq
5,this is an excellent cheesecake i made it as written for thanksgiving then omitted the peanut butter and candy cups and use this as my basic cheesecake recipe comes out beautiful everytime only difference is i use a waterbath when i bake it
5,i made this for my daughters th birthday and it was a smash hit other than using an alloreo crust i made this as written it was easy and so so good will definitely keep in my recipe box and make again
5,made this for my coworkers and it was a humongous hit didnt change a thing and will definitely be making it often
5,made this for wifes church bake sale several years ago and theyve begged for another every subsequent year it has always cracked in the past so this year i baked at f for minutes with a pan of water in the oven then turned off the oven and left it in oven with door cracked for more minutes no cracks in cake also helpful to know c graham cramer crumbs is crackers c oreo crumbs is oreo cookies
5,very good recipeunfortunately the prep time is not realistic started it at at night and got it to the refrigerator after midnight
5,my husband love anything with peanut butter but hes not a big fan of cheesecake this he loves great recipe
5,the crust a mix of graham crackers and oreos is what sets this cheesecake apart from the rest it is delicious my motherinlaw loves peanut butter and she cant get enough of this rich creamy cheesecake
5,psubstitutions i madepp peak freans lifestyle cookies dark chocolatecherry instead of graham cracker crumbssandwich cookies i just used cup and a half of the lifestyles cookies and it was delishpp instead of hot fudge ice cream topping i used nutella also deliciouspp i noticed that the peanut butter really did not make an appearance in the final product maybe i did something wrong but the peanut oil seeped out of the springform pan and onto the cookie sheet which i dont think was a problem but maybe add more peanut butter or perhaps mix it into the batterpp i misread the instructions and melted butter for the crust but then stupidly measured out tbsps of the melted stuff and only put that in the crust was definitely drier than i wouldve liked it so dont make the same mistake as me always add a lot of butterppi also didnt have an electric mixer which resulted in a pretty lumpy batter luckily i had some extra muscle on hand to stir it up but i think an electric mixer would have made things easier ppp i added cut up peanut butter cups into the batter before i poured the chocolate part on and it was such a good idea they melted into the cake and it was impossible to see them but they definitely made the cake richer and more velvety they added a distinct peanut butter cup taste very goodp
5,great recipe to cut down just a little on the calories i used peanut butter chips instead of the cups on the top but still the best peanut butter cheesecake recipe ever
5,five stars arent enough im always looking for new cheesecake recipes this was delicious definitely will make again and again i wouldnt change a thing

5,everyone loved this and ive had requests to make it again
5,i made this cheesecake for thanksgiving it is delicious everyone loved itthey couldnt believe i made itthey all thought it was from the cheesecake factory i will definitely make it again
5,i made this for a friend who has had lots of things ive baked and she always likes them a lot but this she declared as her absolute favorite she brought one small piece home to her family and they all fought over it shes already requesting it for her birthday again next year i have to agree it was amazing i did not change one thing in the recipe if youre a chocolate peanut butter fan who also likes cheesecake you have to try this one warning though i made homemade fudge sauce for the top but the recipe i have gets hard when chilled luckily i had time to go to the store and buy a jar because the other would have been too hard to cut through without tearing the cake apart for once a storebought ingredient was better than homemade
5,this cheesecake is stunning and delicious ive made it twice to use as gifts and the recipients raved i use a few more reeses than the recipe calls for to get that wow appearance on top recommend this recipe highly
5,i first made this recipe years ago when it was on the cover of toh and i made my husband take a picture of me with my finished product and my toh cover this cheesecake is a little time consuming but worth every second it looks so wonderful on a table atop a pedestal plate and it tastes every bit as good as it looks
5,delicious this is one of the best cheesecakes i have ever tasted you cant go wrong with peanut butter and chocolate i made it according to the directions except i doubled the reeses cups on top i took it to a thanksgiving carryin and everyone raved about it just make sure everyone sees it when it is whole because cutting it ruins the pretty look my slices looked nothing like the photo but thats why magazines have food stylists most amazing flavor and i will definitely be making it again the only thing i might change is the crust and make an all oreo crust
5,this turned out so good i cant wait to make it again instead of using the fudge for the top i used the reeses shell for ice cream worked great
5,holy cheesecake this was amazingly good i made it for my valentine and he loved it keep in mind this is very rich but full of peanut butter and chocolate flavor took some time to make but i will definately make this again
5,have made this several times and always a hit my family likes it when i add peanut butter cups on top of the peanut butter layer
5,this is one of those recipes that my family keeps requesting made it for a holiday gathering a few years ago and everyone is still talking about it
5,omg this cheesecake was positively sinful everyone loved it
5,this recipe was a major hit have already made several of them
5,i made this cheesecake for a birthday party and it was a big hit with all of the guests i used miniature peanut butter cups cut in half the birthday girl asked for the recipe
5,made this today for the first time went a more keto friendly route and used turnips instead of potatoes came out amazing i saw several comments asking if anyone has tried using a different cheese i switched velveta for cup sharp cheddar cup smoked cheddar cup smoked gouda and cup gruyere i dont know how the velveta version tastes but this came out amazing
5,i use some petite diced tomatoes too as for velveeta subs no not a good idea but i do add some grated sharp cheddar in addition to but stir in at the end i skipped the dried herbs as well
5,i made this asis with the exception of cutting the carrots in to chunks and adding a couple of cups of colby jack cheese along with the velveeta along with some nice dinner rolls this was delicious this time i used the measurements listed next time im going to double it so i can throw some in the freezer
5,this soup was a big hit in our house i had lb of ground beef so i doubled the recipe i only had oz velveeta cheese and approx slices of kraft cheese slices so i used that and thought that if i would have doubled the cheese it may have been too cheesy for our liking however we did garnish our bowls with grated cheddar cheese i cant believe this is the first time in my life that ive hat cheeseburger soup thanks taste of home
5,not sure why i waited so long to make thisit is so delicious i followed the recipe as directed but used a whole pound of ground beef a whole diced onion and a little less than half of a large brick lb size of velveeta i also didnt shred the velveeta but cubed it and it melted just fine added bacon crumbles for even more flavor will be adding this to my winter comfort food rotationsooooo good
5,wow i can see how this recipe got so many good reviews my neighbor made this soup and shared it with me she followed the directions exactly and im glad she did i found this soup to me rich and flavorful with a nice consistency and adding the sour cream at the end gives it a smooth and creamy texture when i make this soup i just might add some cooked and crumbled bacon other than that its perfect
5,really enjoyed this changed the cheese to cheddar and used milk hubby really liked this will be definitely be making again
5,this recipe is re kick starting my luv for soupsbased upon what i just read my mouth is really watering for this one
5,my husband gave this stars i made a double recipe and i changed it a bit it went against my cooking history to leave the ground beef with no seasoning so i added a little garlic powder when frying and then a little salt after frying then i used cheddar cheese instead of velveeta cheese next time i will use a cup or two more cheese i will definitely be making this in the future
5,it tastes amazing and i have made it for family dinner for about three times and my family has loved it every time
5,delicious love it can it be frozen i didnt think so
5,love this soup use tater tots bake nice and crispy and then cut them up and add to soup also add tbsp of ketchup yellow mustard and dill relish i use sharp cheddar and american to the soup instead of velvetta everyone i give it to raves about this soup secert a half tsp of worchershire sauce
5,made this in the crockpot and it turned out delicious instead of velveeta cheese i just used what i had in the fridge half a block of habanero cheese and about a small jar of cheese wiz left out the sour cream
5,made this for our soup supper at church and everyone loved it
5,this is a quick and easy recipe i added brown sugar and cinnamon and salt to the apple mixture it turned out really good i have noticed on alot of recipes i find on line there is always something missing
5,this recipe knocked it out of the park for me i am not even a pie lover but this was extremely good also the easiest pie i have ever made love the you do not have to roll out a crust and the topping is made right with the crust so there is no extra step to make the topping yes i added cinnamon woopy doo this recipe deserves a star in my book
5,this was soooo good and very easy i am not a baker but the boys requested apple pie for thanksgiving dessert and i just cant stomach the storebought piesfillings i did add cinnamon and nutmeg to the filling and chopped pecans to the topping which turned out great will definitely make this one again
5,i made this recipe with just a few minor changes i added sweetened dried cranberries to the apple mixture for the color i used margarine instead of butter and i sprinkled the top with cinnamon i must say this is an easy recipe to make and its delicious stars for sure
5,i made this yesterday and followed the recipe exactly except for adding teaspoon of cinnamon to the filling before adding the apples i used a glass pie pan and baked for minutes it came out perfect the cups for the topping was spot on i thought the apples could have cooked a little longer i used gala next time i might try a different one i will definitely be making this again
5,i chose this cheesecake as my very first baked cheesecake for thanksgiving last year it turned out perfect and it is very good i didnt add the chocolate on top one i didnt want to cover up the swirl design and two it really didnt need anyhing else the cheesecake is creamy and richjust the way a cheesecake should be you definitely do not need a large slice of this
5,this was so good it received many rave reviews i am not much of a cheesecake person but absolutely loved this it is very rich though so eat small slices this took a while to make but well worth it
5,this cheesecake is to die for this one goes in my recipe file i took this to a a meeting and everyone absolutely loved it
5,i made this for my mothers birthday and it was a big hit
5,i personally dont like cheesecake but i made it for a birthday party and everyone loved it the only thing isit came out pretty attractive but not nearly as neat looking as the photo
5,this pie is very good mostly due to the crust i followed the recipe exactly as written except i added cinnamon nutmeg and allspice to the crumb mixture and the filing thanks to the reviewers i also added pecans to the topping will definitely make again

5,i have made this for years and it is a family favorite i do add a little cinnamon to apples

5,wonderful family loved it used red delicious apples turned out beautifully
5,i just used the crumb topping because i have a great recipe for apple pie this topping was delicious i cant wait to make it again maybe today
5,i made this last year for thanksgiving and it turned out great i just wanted to know if you can make it the night before anybody please help
5,i made the pie the night before and then baked it during dinner so it would be warm for dessert it came out perfect the only thing i did was add cinnamon to the filling and little to the crust as well i also used honeycrisp apples fantastic
5,my friend and i like to get together and bake new recipes once a month today we made this and the filling is perfectly sweet and tart we added teaspoon cinnamon and th teaspoon to the filling and cut the vanilla to a small splash the crust is perfect for people who love pie but hate making crust will totally make this again
5,made this pie and thought it was really good did like the crust it reminded me of a cookie i also liked the filling a lot was very good seemed like an apple pie filling youd find in a premade apple pie for some reason my pie crust was pretty thick even though i used inch pie plate my crust came out really hard also i think i may have cooked a little too long i noticed no one else had this problem so im sure it was on my end
5,i love this soup its one of my favourites i substitute ground chicken or turkey for the ground beef and i add garlic i have used different types of cheese but the velvetta works well these are just my own personal preferences turns out great every time no matter what type of cheese i use
5,loved it but used cheddar instead of velveeta
5,i love this soup its so cheesy and satisfying
5,this is a family favourite
5,this cheeseburger soup is absolutely amazing i first made this when my husband was doing chemo and radition treatments only thing he could eat even after his surgery he cant eat very well but this soup does the trick i make it quite often and it jusy keeps getting better
5,my family couldnt stop raving about this soup i didnt have celery so i left it out we will definitely make it again
5,made this recipe pretty much as written except for no sour cream because i forgot to pick some up even though i am not usually a fan of velveeta it was hearty and had a good rich flavor that both my husband and i enjoyed definitely a keeper
5,this soup is awesome i made a few changes because my husband likes a heartier soup i doubled the burger added bacon and used beef broth instead of chicken broth it came out amazing this is a keeper
5,love made a version for a soup contest and got nd i would recommend sticking with the lower amount of valveeta adding a cup of pepper jack cheese and adding nearly a cup of chicken broth
5,the best soup ever
5,family favorite i use a whole pound of ground beef
5,we love it thank you i did make some adjustments i only had shredded mexican cheese on hand and beef broth so i used those instead of chicken broth and velveeta i also didnt add sour cream my kids from yrsyrs all loved it we will make it again thank you
5,incredible soup i cannot believe how good this is i used leftover taco meat and something about those taco spices in the soup put this over the top
5,my family absolutely loves this recipe
5,i made this for my granddaughters graduation party and unfortunately there was not enough i might try to double recipe and make in x pan next time i also added cups of apples l t cinnamon l t nutmeg and a sml spot of lemon juice
5,i forgot to mention that it was delicious and everyone loved it
5,made this recipe the other night and it turned out wonderful i took advice from a previous review and added chopped pecans to the pie crust and was not disappointedthe filling set up perfect and the crust stayed together and was easily lifted out of the pie platethis will be my go to apple pie recipe from now onthanks again toh for another great recipe
5,beyond delicious this is our new favorite dessert i added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the apple mixture as we love the taste of apples and cinnamon will return to this recipe often
5,easy and tastes great i had cinnamon too to the filling
5,wonderfully delicious and easy i think this has become my families favorite apple pie the only thing i did different with the recipe is to add lots of cinnamon and nutmeg to the filling i also sometimes add toasted pecans to the topping its an easy enough recipe that anyone who can chop apples can make this
5,i took this pie to thanksgiving and had never even attempted an apple pie wow was it a hit there was one piece left when we were done and my dad claimed it for himself before anyone else could i also added about tsp cinnamon and tsp nutmeg this pie is super easy and especially delicious
5,this is the best apple pie ever my friends and family always request this i follow the recipe exactly no changes needed the flavor is great i make every fall and freeze them for the rest of the winter
5,awesome so easy to make and it tasted incredible i did add a bit of cinnamon we served with ice cream
5,this recipe is wonderful i used the crust and topping part of the recipe with the apple pie filling i had frozen and the two recipes complimented each other perfectly i will definitely make it again and am also anxious to try the whole recipe when our apple tree bears again this fall
5,as a pie lover it is difficult for a pie to really impress me this recipe not only impressed me it changed me i added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the glaze as other reviewers suggested other than that everything was perfect the glaze was just the right amount to perfectly coat the apples with no excess remaining
5,this is a great easy recipe for people on the go or who have never done an apple pie before i have to agree with the other folks make your pie filling with spices or it will be bland i didnt cook my filling i went old school and dumped the raw apples cornstarch and everything in a bowl mixed it together and it baked up just fine one tip i think you may find useful is you can also use instant oatmeal packets just cut back on the brown sugar for the topping i used cup packed brown sugar also i doubled the recipe for the crust and the topping using packets of apple cinnamon oatmeal for each for a deep dish pie i just found that saving a cup wasnt enough for the topping but boy was it delicious i used a combination of each jonathan and granny smith apples and it turned out mighty tasty great starter recipe to build on or to make on the fly
5,great crust and topping but where is the cinnamon i added cinnamon and nutmeg and got some great reviews from family and friends i didnt cook the apples i just added them to the filling and this turned out fine i slice my apples thin so this probably helped
5,in the netherlands we call this kind of pie omas appel taart a nans apple pie in english but in all dutch apple pies there will be cinnamon in itfor a twist add about gr about ounces raisins into apple mix it taste delicious
5,ive made this twice so far and everyone who has tasted it absolutely loved it i added cinnamon to the filling
5,when i find a recipe online i always look at the comments to see what others said about it before i commit to making it i agree with most comments that this was absolutely delicious the only thing i changed was when making the filling i added a little more than tablespoon of cinnamon and teaspoon of ground cloves i added it as soon as i turned on the burner and whisked it in a little at a time i will be making this often
5,this my favorite apple pie recipe it is easy to put together and oh so delicious
5,i made this pie it was great it was easy my family loved it i will be making this pie again
5,i own a small organic apple farm and i am always trying new recipesthis pie was easy and deliciousi did make the filling sauce with my home made apples juice and i added cinnamonthis will be my new go to recipe for apple pie
5,so creamy and delicious
5,fantastic easy to follow and quick i added cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg will make again and again
5,my dads favorite dessert has always been apple pie several years ago my sister and i went apple picking and went searching for a good apple pie recipe to make with the apples we got for our dad this is the absolute best pie ever my dad fell in love and now we make it for every family gathering holiday and birthday over the years we have spiced it up quite a bit by adding cinnamon and nutmeg to the filling we also add crushed pecans to the crust which is a great addition we have also on occasion added dried cranberries to the filling this pie is easy and delicious i highly recommend it
5,i have made this pie many times over the years it is not a traditional apple pie as it contains no cinnamon but its still yummy we like to eat warm slices along with vanilla ice cream lori in wi
5,very good loved the topping
5,very tasty not real sweet i added cinnamon and sugar to the apples before putting them together with the cornstarch and water
5,first pie ive ever made turned out perfect tart and juicy but not to sweet and gooey will definitely be making this again
5,this actually makes a much better apple crisp i just place apples in the bottom of a baking dish and sprinkle the crust portion on top i also add tsp cinnamon when making the apple mixture
5,loved the pie i used cup brown sugar blend and only cup splenda i also used some cinnamon and nutmeg in the apple mix it was delicious
5,very good i increased the receipe ingredients to make it deep disn of course i increased the cooking time i also added tsp cinnamon to the syrup mix for a more thanksgivingfall flavor
5,when this particular recipe did come out i had prepared it and it was really good dawn e lowenstein
5,i recall making this pie and i adjusted the recipe by using cup either regular or quick oats tsp ground ginger to tsp ground nutmeg and to tsp ground cinnamon i found this recipe very simple to prepare delowenstein
5,great recipe i did change it up some i used cup brown sugar blend splenda and splenda in place of the sugar in the fillingand i used about cups applegt i love more filling in my pie also added cinnamon and nutmeg with the pie filling it was so goood that it never had a chance to cool off
5,i have made this pie several times over the years and people actually request it if you love fruit crisps you will like this pie it is best eaten fairly soon after you make it as the topping starts to draw moisture from the fruit
5,omg this was so good hubby doesnt want any other apple pie
5,ive made the pie many many times and make these adjustments every time i use brown sugar instead of white add cinnamon vanilla butter and a dash of lemon juice to the filling after its thickened its always a hit
5,this is possible the best apple pie anyone i have ever served it to has eve had after making a few changes for deep dish i doubled the oats used cups butter and used alittle more flour for the crust and topping i also omitted the water cornstrach method althogether but added alittle lemon juice to the apples instead i mixed same amount of tapioca as cornstarch into appleswhich can be increased along with sugar depending on pan side along with the sugar and put the vanilla in apples too decreased the oven temp to and baked until apples were done i also covered the edges with tin foil from the start never stayed on the counter very long yum yum
5,the best pie of this type i have ever made this will probably be my go to recipe for apple pie i used rome apples and added a few sprinkles of spices i used pumpkin pie spices since i was out of apple pie spices they are basically the same the family loved this pie
5,this fantastic soup is a favorite of my whole family and anyone serve it to a little labor intense but soo worth it
5,i made this last night it was so delicious that i had the leftover for brunch the only thing i did differently was add a can of drained green beans to it because i didnt have any celery cant wait to make it again
5,i am not a big soup fan but i love love love this soup it takes a little time to prepare but it is so very worth every minute
5,i absolutely loved this soup so easy to make and it contains ingredients i typically have on hand i did use a full pound of ground beef but didnt change anything else delicious
5,this soup was so easy to make and i had most of the ingredients on hand i changed a few things only because of what i had on hand i used pound of ground beef instead of a half pound i used cups of potatoes instead of cups and i used beef broth instead of chicken broth i made bread bowls to serve the soup in my husband sister and year old niece loved this soup
5,love it pretty much followed the directions except i used the white queso velveeta instead of the regular my husband went back for rds my daughter who hates cheeseburgers loved it and said that she wants it again and again im from wisconsin as well so this super cheesy soup is right up my ally thanks so much for sharing it with us shawhan
5,i have made a version of this for years it is a family favorite and i have served it to company and the also loved it its a fast and easy recipe to make and i always make eougj for leftovers
5,ive made this twice now the first time according to recipe but used real wi cheese dont do celery because my daughter doesnt like it the second time i added more hamburger a bit of minced garlic and a lot more grated sharp cheddar we love it
5,i enjoy learning from other people who really can cook unlike me just following recipes i have learned a lot from people who find a recipe and alter it before even trying it i have tried to do that here i substituted chicken for the beef margarine for the butter used a nosalt version of chicken broth cornstarch for the flour tofu for the velveeta skim milk instead of whole did not add any salt and used cultured buttermilk instead of sour cream my family has decided that i can have it all to myself its their loss thank you for this recipe
5,this recipe is popular for very valid reasons i doubled it and fed my family of ages to some of them very picky eaters and everyone loved it even the leftovers were consumed it is simple to make the ingredients are readily available i have to admit it isnt the healthiest dish i make but every once in awhile for us consuming things like this in moderation is the key for my family this fits the comfort food category
5,i made this soup for dinner tonight and am very pleased at how it turned out i followed the recipe ingredients exactly except i didnt thicken the soup with the flour mixture i didnt use it because then my gluten free son in law can also eat it it was still a very nice consistency i also used half velveeta cheese and half cooper sharp just because i already had some to use up i also doubled the meat it is delicious
5,ive made this soup twice in the past days my family loves it i added more meat for our liking i used about lbs of very lean ground beef i increased the broth to cups the milk to cups and used half a large i think a lb brick container of velveeta hubby suggested adding some bacon which sounds fabulous
5,this is hands down our favorite soup we have been making this recipe for a few years now but we make it a tad bit different we use sausage instead of ground beef and the flavor is absolutely amazing we do everything else the same except using the entire block of velveeta we eat it with french bread and its the best
5,i made this hamburger soup and it was the best soup i have ever and i do mean ever tasted forget the leftovers there wont be any unless you double it and freeze some for later
5,gads how good is this forgot the sour creme still awesomeness i added some roasted garlic powder and bacon for topping house smells amazing and the taste is incredible thank you
5,i am not a pie crust lover and neither is my husband so we look for recipes that have an alternative crust this pie was absolutely delicious and a big hit at the family thanksgiving dinner i will definitely be making this again thank you for sharing this with us
5,my whole family enjoys this for dessert ive made it several times for pot luck events and always receive rave reviews
5,yum im so glad there were leftovers after my hubby took it for his friends really great how regarding the spicesit was only after i began baking that i realized the filling contained no spices in shock i ran to read all the reviews and saw nearly everyone added them so i did too i added cinnamon nutmeg and allspice it tasted amazing without the spices the filling was very blandthe crust on the other handwow very fattening and high in sugar but wow deffo a recipe i will return to regularly
5,pyes the crust is a little dense as others have mentioned but it is very easy to make and it is tasty i also happened to have made it with door county cherries and like that too this is currently my pie recipe of choice because the crust is so easy to make and tasty and doesnt have a bunch of chemicals in it like a store bought premade crust making a traditional crust is sometimes a hassle that doesnt always turn out well for me anywaysp
5,i have made this pie for years and it is one of my favorite fast homemade recipes its a good one for new or young cooks to try because its easy yet it looks much more difficult than it is so its a good one to use to impress the inlaws or others i also add a little cinnamon to the apples
5,ive been making this recipe for a few years now ive also make it using pitted door county cherries amp using the cherry juice from the cherries instead of water its delicious
5,this pie was so yummy and amazingly easy to make we harvested our apple tree and wanted to try something new but were a bit intimidated by standard pie crust this came together easily pressed into the pie plate in no time at all and was so delish we added a little cinnamon to both the crust and the apple mixture yum
5,husband loved this recipe
5,this has become one of my favorite apple pie recipes
5,i did take the advice of other reviewers and added tsp apple pie spice delish it was fast and easy to make and i love the crumble mixture for the crust will definitely be making more of these throughout the apple harvest
5,this is the only apple pie recipe that my husband wants me to make and i make it a lot i sometimes cook the apples a little to soften and add cinnamonnutmeg to the mix as well
5,this is the best apple pie i have ever tasted in my life i am making it again right now the old guy at the apple barn told us to use baking apples they sure do make a difference i give this one six stars
5,pvery tasty and good it didnt last long at my tablep
5,this pie is easy to make and great when you dont feel like rolling out pastry i added cinnamon to it and everyone loved it
5,this is a big favorite in our house it was the first pie recipe both our daughters baked so easy with the patinthepan crust sometimes if were short on fresh fruit well make it with canned apple pie filling delicious and even more so with a scoop of vanilla ice cream
5,absolutely fantastic family loved itdid add maple syrup to apples and did cut back on the cornstarch by tablespoon worked out great
5,my husband said this was the best apple pie hes had i added cinnamon and nutmeg and used an extra apple and a little less sugar in the filling the apples were fresh tasting and the crust was crunchy and delicious ill be making this again
5,i would bake it a touch longer because i prefer the apples softer but the taste was terrific and i like the oatmeal in the crust it reminds me of a pie and apple crisp rolled into one
5,quick and easy recipe wonderful taste my parents dont even like apple pie but they very much enjoyed this one
5,i may never make a regular crust again this is a great pie i added about teaspoon of salt to the filling then i added a teaspoon of salt and cinnamon to the crust accidentally i put the apples in with the water and starch and it still worked
5,absolutely delicious we had it for thanksgiving dinnermy daughter added walnuts to the toppingyum
5,great wonderful flavor added walnuts to top crumb mixture
5,exact words from my husband on its own it is a brilliant combination of sweet and savory he was quite happy with this meal it needs to be pared with a vegetable and or starch that compliments rather than overshadows it this will be a go to meal when i want to please my family
5,really good i have made this twice the second time only loosely following the recipe no measuring and i forgot the brown sugar and my family all enjoyed it this will be one of my quick fix main dishes from now on
5,used lemon juice and fresh ground pepper also put chicken in oven with cheese broiled for a couple minutes just to melt cheese sooo good
5,we thoroughly enjoyed this recipe i usually make the st attempt exactly as written but in this case i liked the idea of cooking the bacon first and frying the chicken breasts in some of the bacon grease reserving tbs for the onions outstanding
5,im diabetic so i replaced the sugar with splenda i also have changed the cups sugar to splenda brown sugar and regular splenda the brown sugar added a really good flavor to the filling my husband loved it i will continue to make this often
5,this pie looks absolutely delicious and i will be making it for my family i know they will love it
5,this pie is easy to make and delicious but i have made it twice and could not get it out of the pie plate either time although the recipe said not to grease the pie plate i did so both times what am i doing wrong help please
5,this was delicious and super easy to makeit turned out great and everyone loved it
5,i love this recipe i made it for thanksgiving and even my motherinlaw was loving it def will make again very easy to transform into a glutenfree recipe
5,we love apple desserts and i make this several times a month i bake it in a x pan and cut it in squares its even great without spices i also add chopped pecans occasionaly to the crumb mixture
5,thi is absolutely the best apple pie recipe my guests just raved about it and are already asking me to make it again the oat and brown sugar crust really sets it apart
5,delicious im not a huge fan of traditional pie crust so this is my new favorite apple pie
5,this soup is fantastic i increased the sour cream to cup and used the max amount velveeta suggested omg it was good
5,i made this recipe for my husband and while already delicious he had the genius idea of adding diced pickles to the soup oh boy that took the soup to the next level the pickles made the soup taste like a cheeseburger in a bowl so good
5,this is a keeper everyone in my family loved this soup even my hesitant husband i doubled the recipe and it turned out amazing shared it with friends and family and they also agree that its a keeper
5,we love this my husband asks for this over and over so i usually make a double batch and we freeze containers for later
5,we have been offering this for many years in our school concession stand i think if we stopped thered be a riot the commenters on this site have become more vicious over the years if you dont like a recipe then give it one star and move on
5,we love cheeseburger soup the potatoes and cheese make this very good
5,yum mmm good i have been making this for about years and it is always a winner when i make this my friend you doesnt eat cheese looks forward to when i make it have never had anyone turn this away it is a very hearty soup and fills you up if you have any left it freezes well
5,first time i made this i found the velveeta made it a little thicker than i was expecting so i made two adjustments kicking the beef up to a full pound and using ounces of apple wood smoked gruyere cheese instead of the velveeta the end result was a submission to the food service at works annual soup and chili contest with a first place win in the soup category and a rotating place on their menu for the past winter season it was so popular that it has become a fixture on the menu every third friday and almost a year later still always sells out
5,absolutely delicious i did tweak it a bit by adding tsp ground mustard and tsp cayenne and since we dont eat velveeta i substituted sharp cheddar i will definitely make it again thanks
5,everyone in my family raves about this recipe even when i double the recipe i rarely have many leftovers
5,why do people rate something one star be ause they dont like the ingredients
5,this is like the best soup my family will request it every time they get one year my son was having a pot luck day at school and insisted that he bring this soup it was a big hit i have added bacon for a change and added pepper jack cheese
5,me and my husband love this usually he is so hard to please and i want a divorce but then ill make this and it shuts him up mmm good
5,very popular dish
5,so good my family loved it
5,i make this recipe all the time i substitute bacon with turkey bacon
5,my husband and i absolutely loved this i am not a big fan of boneless chicken breasts but they were on sale what a big delicious surprise this dish was thank you so much brenda for sharing it
5,made this tonight no real changes to the recipe except for adding a fresh jalapeno pepper to the onions wow excellent great flavor for next time i would add two jalapeno peppers minus the seeds for a little kick this was truly awesome thank you so much
5,easily one of my new favorites thanks
5,great recipereally liked campcooks idea of cooking chicken first to lower temp and continuing in oven while proceeding with bacon and onions chicken much warmer for eating that way
5,ill give it a for flavor and fir directions agree with jason cook bacon first and use it sauté no need for butter
5,this is a very easy and tasty the only change i make is i add green bell pepper to the onion mixture we love it
5,this is so delicious i took jasons suggestion and cooked the bacon first reserved some bacon grease cooked the chicken in the bacon grease that was left in the pan then sautéed the onion in the reserved grease it turned out so amazingly tender and flavorful my yearold son who does not love meat asked for more
5,delicious we liked it and make variations which are all good we modified steps so it all came out warm
5,i didnt think this would have much flavor but i was very happy with the end results i did pound out the chicken before cooking just to speed up the cooking time i cut down on the sugar as other viewers suggested but will not do it again i think the brown sugar is what made this so good my kids loved it i will definitely be making this again
5,my wife made this for dinner tonight and it was a big hit with our family she just didnt add the chesse because my husband cant have cheese and it was still delicious we will make again for sure
5,amazing flavor my husband amp i both loved it its a keeper
5,my family loved it including my husband who is not a fan of chicken or onions i used turkey bacon and served with rice i added water to the brown sugar and onions to make a sauce and will double next time definitely a keeper
5,scrumptious for the cheese i used thin slices of gouda since thats what i had in the fridge very simple to prepare i baked the chicken in the oven first instead of pan frying it because i was busy doing other things so i didnt want to be tied to the stove flipping the chicken
5,anything with bacon is delicious
5,my family loved this recipe even my son who hates onions but i substituted garlic powder for the lemon pepper didnt like the lemon pepper
5,this was so easy and delicious it was something i would never think of to make i think next time the only thing i may do is toss the skillet in the oven to melt the cheese more
5,there isnt anything to change with this recipe one of the best thank you brenda for sharing
5,the chicken was very moist and the combination of bacon carmelized onions and cheese was delicious
5,there wasnt anything about this recipe that wasnt spectacular seriously simple tasty quick
5,fabulous this recipe is easy and delicious try it you wont be sorry
5,love this recipe eliminated the lemon pepper and used salt pepper chilli powder and garlic powder as spices everything else the same my family loved it will definitely make again
5,delicious and easy to prepare thanks for a great recipe
5,i have made this several times and my family loves it i also cook the bacon first then the onions and chicken its really important not to overcook the onions easy recipe and tastes great
5,excellent as written made as sandwiches
5,made this tonite my very picky family loved it very easy and so delicious even my daughter who always avoid onions saidmom you should totally make this again didnt change any ingredients but did crumbled the bacon thanks for sharing
5,so delicious
5,spectacular
5,this dish has the right amount of sweetness with the brown sugar my husband says he has never had anything like it but loves it i will unquestionably be making this again i did cut this recipe in half and also cut down on the bacon to only slices but chopped it up
5,turned out amazing i put it all under the broiler for a minute to melt the cheese before serving
5,the sweetness of the brown sugar onions with the bacon and cheese is the perfect combination had dinner done in minutes perfect for the low carb lovers and the picky eaters
5,delicious the whole family loves it i add a little honey mustard to the caramelized onions and its a wonderful addition
5,this was a delicious way to fix chicken i cut a thick chicken breast in half vertifcally and used one slice of bacon for each half breast i also used mozzarella cheese instead of colbymonterey
5,ohhh so good
5,this is one of the best recipes i have ever made everyone enjoyed it and cleaned their plate i will say your chicken breasts wont cook in minutes on each side i flattened mine for more even cooking but they still took minutes or more when i figured they were taking a long time i cooked the bacon separately otherwise dinner would have been really late once the chicken was done i put some bacon grease in the chicken pan and cooked the onions i added a bit of chicken broth to the pan to deglaze and i had a bit of a really nice gravy that was totally unexpectedi also worried that cooking everything in the order that the chicken would get cold i agree the steps should be reversed cook the bacon then onions then chicken and i suggest adding the onions back to the pan with the chicken to warm them before serving that way everything is hot and the cheese will melt this will definitely be made again in our house
5,my family loved this will make again
5,my husband loved it i had a lot of fun creating something that was different from the normal weeknight meal
5,i prepared this delicious chicken dish the other night and both my husband and i loved it it is easy to prepare by following the steps we will definitely have this again absolutely delicious i highly recommend this recipe as a volunteer field editor
5,i prepared it exactly as directed and we loved it thank you for a great recipe
5,so easy and oh sooooooooooo good
5,this was wonderful
5,this was so good i did not use the lemonpepper seasoning just black pepper and i put cheddar cheese on instead of colbymonterey cheese my picky year old ate the whole portion super quick
5,pmy husband and son both agreed it was the best chicken they have ever hadp
5,this was so easy and tasted amazing will definitely make again
5,this is excellent my husband wants it again i didnt have the cheese the recipe called for so i used smoked goudaso good i will be making this again
5,this was very tasty i will make it again
5,delicious i will definitely be making this again maybe next time seasoning the chicken with something different than lemon pepper
5,we used cheddar cheese and it was amazing will make again soon
5,made this twice now used one pound of ground beef milk and shredded sharp cheddar cheese the second time and i think this made the flavor better
5,first time making this i used a can of cheddar cheese soup and milk and just used a dollop of sour cream in the bowl if anyone wanted it it didnt take long to make was easy and we loved it
5,we really liked this soup especially on a cold fall day next time i will double the beef and half the potatoes
5,just made this for the first time and my family loved it i omitted the carrots and added some jalapenos to give it a little kick i also used frozen potatoes which saved time doubled the batch and its going fast
5,loved this recipe huge hit i mixed up the cheeses and it was amazing will make again absolutely love this soup so easy and fillling
5,one of the absolute best soups i have made yet and i make soup every sunday no doubt this will be gone in the next few days i added cups of chicken broth instead cups of milk and i doubled the ground beef as others suggested turned out fantastic
5,i recall making this soup back when i was first getting the taste of home annual recipe books however id used sliced carrots potato chunks cheddar cheese milk and instead of sour cream id used ranch dressing i used lb of ground beef id checked my logbooks of reviews and i dont recall rating this recipe
5,it took a while for me to get my husband to even try a spoon of this soup he loved it it is his most requested soup easy to make and easy too change up if desired definitely a keeper
5,delicious and perfect for a cold winter afternoon i heeded the commentsused x more beef half as much potatoes and shredded cheddar instead of velveeta hubby bragged at work and i shared the recipe definitely making again
5,totally delicious this is our go to soup any time of year ive shared this recipe with many family members i do no change any of the ingredients obviously a family favorite
5,this is a very moist and flavorful chicken i made this when we had guests over for dinner and we all loved it it even reheat pretty well for lunch the next day
5,very good my husband and i both loved it
5,this was so simple and so flavorful everything worked well together my husband and i both really enjoyed it
5,im not a huge bacon fan but i decided to try it and im glad i did this is absolutely delish the onions and the bacon were so good with the chicken i love it
5,this is sooo yummy i cut the bacon and the onion into smaller pieces to make it easier to eat but otherwise did exactly as described and was very happy with this will certainly be making this again
5,this is a great flavor combination i loved it my only suggestion is to cook the bacon at the same time as the chicken in another skillet at the end i placed the chicken in the skillet i had cooked the onions in and layered the chicken in there and allowed the cheese to melt delicious
5,i had at my sisters place and absolutely loved it even tough i dont like onions they were caramilzed and yummy
5,made this tonight for my family and they loved it
5,i made this last night for the first time and it was really delish i did modify some things however instead of lemon pepper rubbed chicken i breaded the chicken in panko because im not a big fan of lemon pepper also instead of bacon slices i chopped the bacon into pieces before cooking it and just piled it on top the only thing i will do differently next time is put the cheese on top of the chicken then the onions and bacon on top of the cheese so everything sticks together better i highly recommend this dish
5,very tasty really with bacon cheese and sweet onions how could it be bad i prepared it in reverse starting with the bacon i chose to dice the bacon before cooking after removing the bacon i did the onions be careful not to overdo the onions or you may end up with caramel onions that stick to your teeth i may or may not have learned that the hard way when the onions were done i removed them to a separate bowl wiped the skillet out and then cooked the chicken once the chicken was done i piled the fixings up on top and let the cheese melt a bit we enjoyed it with mashed potatoes and brussels sprouts yum
5,the onions dont taste like onions and you can barely tell there is lemon pepper on it it was reallllllly good
5,i made this for my mother and she loved it
5,delicious everyone gave this chicken recipe a thumbs up followed the recipe as written except to give the cheese topped masterpiece time to melt great recipe
5,i also made this in reverse cooking the bacon first then the onions and then the chicken i seasoned the chicken with montreal steak seasoning instead of lemon pepper after the chicken was cooked i placed the broken up bacon pieces and onions on top i then added the cheese and placed a lid on the skillet to allow the cheese to melt delicious i have also subbed swiss cheese for the colby monterey jack sometimes i add sautéed mushrooms to the toppings this is a great recipe that can be tweaked to meet the tastes of your family
5,delicious made for dinner tonight with some minor changeshad no chicken breasts so used skinless thighs and legs and more onions i may cut down the sugar or use splenda since i am diabetic
5,my son found this recipe and when i tried it he loved it my husband is a diabetic and i used the splenda brown sugar when i made it when he was home and it tasted just as good as with the regular brown sugar
5,as quick and easy to make as it is delicious
5,this was delicious i took other reviewers advice and used about half of the brown sugar called for in the recipe to carmelize the onions and also poured off most of the bacon fat this was really good and very easy
5,fantastici also cut the br sugar in half and used pepper jack cheese instead we like a little spice it was very easy and gooooodthanks
5,excellent my husband is already asking to have this again we added a splash of white wine when cooking the onions to deglaze the pan the onions are the best part amp i will probably double them next time i make itwhich will be soon
5,this recipe should be rated above a star it was so favorful i did use the bacon strips that are cooked in the microwave which saved time
5,very tasty would definitely make this again
5,very good i omited the sugar and used sweeter white wine to deglaze the pan and carmalize the onions added some chipolte spice to the onions at the end it was great thanks for sharing
5,great brown sugar taste with the onions and my husband thinks that the bacon gives it just the right touch
5,my husband amp i loved this recipe i followed the advice in several of the comments and only used half of the brown sugar the onions were awesome next time i may use pepperjack cheese instead
5,this is delicious and easy to make if you use a sugar substitute blend of brown sugar like the splenda brown sugar blend it cuts the carbs a bit and is something that can be included in a diabetic diet as well
5,this was wonderful my son took leftovers to work and was sharing with coworkers who then wanted the recipe
5,this was so good the onions had the best caramelized taste ever my fiance my kids and i will definitely be making this on a regular base
5,these are our favorite i like to use thin sliced chicken breasts and i double the onions bc theyre sooooo good
5,this is awesome we love it instead of lemon pepper i used ranch seasoning i usually cook the chicken in a seperate pan so that i can cook the onions for a longer period of time i like them very carmelized
5,can i use lemon curd in this recipe
5,this is the best sweet bread i have ever made it keeps well in the freezer and stays so nice and moist i left out the nuts because i didnt want anything to detract from the lemon and blueberry flavors
5,fantastic
5,i like the idea of the flattened chicken i also modified the recipe by cubing the chicken and breaking the bacon into bite size pieces this makes it easier for younger children to enjoy too
5,the flattened chicken was great it took minutes for my onions to carmelize so the minute total is rather misleading i left the cheese out and it was fabulous
5,i had my father over for dinner and prepared this mealit is one of his favorites now since it was such a big hit with my dad i decided to bring some to my grandma who is very critical of food and she loved it too she said it reminded her of something shed order at outback steakhouse ill be making this meal again for sure
5,i made this recipe last night and my family loved it my youngest son said this one is a keeper very easy to make my husband loved the onions i didnt make enough cant wait to make it again thanks brendavikki
5,this was very good but a little on the sweet side next time ill cut the sugar by at least half and possibly add some pepper flakes or use pepper jack cheese to heat it up a little we grilled the chicken and added the toppings afterwards
5,just made this for dinner and it was fantastic i made it in minutes flat by cutting the chicken breasts thin and cooking the bacon in the microwave served it over rice with a side of green beans and pillsbury biscuitstasted great and looked good too
5,this was soooo good and quick my mouth waters just thinking about it
5,this was just terrific all the best flavors this will become a regular on our dinner table from here on
5,this was fantastic i did alter some of the ingredients to suit our tastes though i used a cajun seasoning rather than the lemonpepper omitted the salt and canola oil used olive oil spray and only used about tbs of brown sugar i also did not reserve any of the drippings but didnt scrape the pan clean either between the drippings that coated the pan and the olive oil spray there was plenty left to saute the onion will become a regular on our table
5,the softness and sweetness of the onions is in delicious contrast to the saltiness and crispness of the bacon fast and easy enough for a busy weeknight but good enough for company good job brenda thanks for sharing
5,this is the best way to eat chicken everything goes together so well i never would have thought of that combination however there is a little too much brown sugar to sautee the onions so i will use less next time but great besides that and will make it on a regular basis
5,i splurged on calories and cooked it as stated im glad i did it was excellent and deserves the prize thanks so much for publishing so all can enjoy
5,really yummy mine did take a lot longer to bake maybe because i used the convection option on my oven but the bread turned out great
5,absolutely delicious i added a cup of raisins and went generous on the blueberries also i divided my sugar into half rawbrown and half whitegranulated for extra flavour made my own glaze by combining tablespoons melted butter cup confectioners sugar teaspoon vanilla essence and tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice made the bread extremely moist and tangy loved this and enjoyed cooking it too if i remembered i would have added some vanilla essence into the bread mix too but works fine without it too
5,this bread was excellent the glaze is the star of the show for this recipe we used fresh blueberries which made a big difference too ive also made into muffins and they were all well received this is a keeper
5,this is so delicious total winner easy to make too
5,this is my goto recipe for quick breads super tasty glaze is great as it soaks in while the bread is warm and give is a flavor burst make two and freeze one you will be glad you did
5,this is wonderful easy to prepare and always appreciated
5,i just made this bread and i love it in my dads words delicious wow im going to my inlaws in michigan and im making the bread before i go to take with me i will try some of blakes suggestions and toast the nuts the next time i make the bread
5,love this easy to prepare and always welcomed as a dessert
5,just made this again the first time was wonderful and since i have a cup of blue berries left over what could be more perfect than making it again absolutely love it and so does my husband who is not a blueberry fan
5,easy fast and delicious i made it for the first time last week and my husband has already asked me to make it againwithin a few days
5,made this bread the other day and we loved it its not overly sweet and is great as a breakfast bread although it can double as a dessert too i used frozen blueberries and omitted the nuts just a personal preference will make this again
5,ive made this bread for a few years now and never can seem to keep it around as for getting servings were lucky to get i usually end up making a second loaf and also make it and give it as gifts
5,omg we do alot of baking and this is easily the most delicious bread weve ever eatenmy son and i wanted to eat it in one sitting we didnt even make the glaze for it and it was still super delicious does not need the glaze
5,this is extremely delicious and amazing with a cup of coffee i shared the recipe with my sister she also bakes frequently
5,this is the easiest bread to make always have all ingredients on hand i do not add the nuts the butter is in the bread part not in the glaze i can not understand how some people thought the butter was in the glaze and i agree i have to cook about minutes longer could be my oven this never disappoints and could certainly be changed up using other berries and juice
5,excellent and easy to make we made it with fresh picked blueberries but next time i would leave out the nuts this bread did not last long we loved it and will make it again
5,i really enjoyed this i used half of the sugar twice the blueberries and added some sour cream since i only had skim milk on hand it was great without the added glaze im not a fan of having more sugar than fruit in a recipe it should be called a sugar blueberry bread based on the proportions in the recipe
5,i won a best in bread ribbon for this quick bread at our local county fair made this exactly as written
5,easy to make and delicious used fresh blueberries and chopped pecans will definitely make again thank you
5,this recipe was excellent thank you for the ones that mention the butter for the glaze obviously didnt read the recipe properly it says glaze ingredient sugar and lemon juice if you going to complaint when a chef kindly share their work then maybe you need to remove yourself from their following
5,i thought this was a delicious recipe i used frozen blueberries full cream milk and a pecan walnut blend it was superb cooked a a toy an hour and was crunchy in the outside light and fluffy inside not sure why some people are saying its dense and heavy maybe not enough baking powder i wouldnt change a thing although im keen to try it with variations orange raspberry and macadamia anyone thank you
5,didnt have baking powder so i substituted with a mix of vinegar and baking soda used frozen blueberries the quick bread turns a beautiful golden color for minute cook time in my gas oven i admit i didnt use a glaze and it was still superb will be making this one again
5,this is absolutely the best lemon blueberry bread in the world followed recipe as is but left out nuts didnt need glaze yummly
5,loved it used gluten free flour instead of regular flour otherwise flowed recipe and it came out great
5,followed recipe exactly yummy and a fan favorite
5,i have tried a couple blueberry lemon loaf recipes but this is the one ive returned to i find it to be more cakedessert like or a yummy snack i use frozen blueberries and it works perfect i mixed icing sugar with lemon juice to make the glaze and it keeps the loaf moist and adds an extra punch of lemon definitely my goto blueberry lemon loaf
5,this bread was very moist the flavors developed more as it sat so we enjoyed it more the next day i followed the recipe exactly
5,i used frozen huckleberries in mine amp omitted the nuts it baked up very moist and tender thank you for the recipe
5,made to enjoy on thanksgiving morning while watching the parade no changes to recipe it was great as is will make this a tradition for when we are able to share our thanksgiving again with family
5,i made this bread yesterday the bread is really really good my husband loved it everything is ok in the recipe except that the butter is part of the ingredients for the bread and not for glaze i know its only a mistake but maybe this information can be help to others
5,this bread is delicious and easy to make would definitely make againand again i used whole milk and omitted nuts didnt have any on hand
5,absolutely delicious make sure to use fresh lemons and dont skimp on the zest i used confectioners sugar instead of granulated i make a lemon cookie with the same glaze and love it so thats why i substituted my husband was planning to take part of this to work to share with his coworkers and he loved it so much he changed his mind so he could eat it all himself perfect with coffee or tea
5,made this for the first time had to make a few changes did not have blueberries or nuts made with lemon raspberry and chocolate chips turned out great everyone loved it
5,my husband could not stop raving about this bread and he is not easy to please
5,made this exactly as written and it was delish there is butter in the recipe given dont know what the confusion is about that and there isnt supposed to be butter in the topping it is a glaze not frosting easy to make quick and perfect
5,we love it i was able to home grown blueberries and lemons ate in day
5,bread recipe was perfect its delicious however the glaze wasehtoo watery i ended up doing it the old fashioned way with a cup of powdered sugar an th of a cup of milk and a tablespoon or two of lemon juice was much better and looked nicer in my opinion
5,ive made this bread a few times and it never disappoints found some more blueberries in the frezzer this morning and since my state still has a stay at home issued because of covid i figured ill add this to my listed of stuff since ive been home since march th ive baked something at least once aweek since march th i highly recommend this recipe i do have to leave it in the oven about mins longer than in the directions but i know over temps vary
5,this is my go to sweet bread recipe i change it up with frozen mixed berries and lime bake in mini loaf pans but keep everything else the same great recipe
5,i love this bread have made it several times i would probably categorize it more cake than bread however i would like to make it in mini loaves to share but dont know how to adjust the baking time any suggestions
5,this is my familys all time favorite soup recipe and they request it multiple times each winter i use leftover meatloaf to make it instead of ground beef
5,outstanding soup really good made with following modifications used combination of no sodiumlow sodium chicken broth and lean ground beef and extra sharp cheddar cheese also sauteed diced potatoes in separate pan before adding to soup the consistency of this soup is perfect somewhat thick and taste is superb if you havent tried it i highly recommend
5,very good id seen the recipe many times but always thought it sounded gross judging by the name after actually reading it i decided to give it a try so glad i did i added oz of chicken broth we like our soup more brothy i used lb of velveeta about cups grated it was plenty of cheese i think more would have been too much i also threw in a couple diced jalepenos ill add a couple more next time my only complaint is the name of the recipe
5,delicious i added more beef veggies and less potato very good
5,this is a delicious hearty soup i could hear my husband telling my granddaughter that it smelled so good as i was cooking it he was so primed to eat this when my son got home my husband asked him if he was hungry or starving one whiff of this soup and my son said starving out of this big pot of soup all that is left is barely enough for one serving tomorrow highly recommend this ty joanie shawhan for sharing this ty toh for posting this once more toh delivers
5,this was excellent the only adjustments i made were to use cheddar instead of velveeta and because my granddaughter just had braces put on i blended it with an immersion blender before adding the milk and cheese it isnt exactly pretty but the flavor is phenomenal
5,this looks delicious if i want to make it in the slow cooker are there anything different to do and also how long would it take to cook in the slow cooker
5,delish will keep it for a regular soup
5,this was a very good soup it was thick and cheesy with lots of veggies pretty much everything i could ask from a soup i can see ways to adjust it for personal tastes with no problems the only thing i didnt like was making the roux separately but i will figure a way around that
5,this is one of my familys favorite recipes ive made it several times as is with one added step the addendum is i use an immersion blender to make the soup creamy my one complaint is the recipe reads makes servings quarts this recipe fills my quart dutch oven plenty of leftovers
5,comfort food supreme no changes needed except salt and pepper preference nice creamy rich soup
5,i made this last night and it was very good definitely making it again i didnt use shredded velveeta but had shredded cheddar cheese didnt whole milk but used and added a tsp or so of dill pickle relish to our servings and it made a huge difference in tasting more like a cheeseburger
5,have been making this for several years without the nuts we prefer nuts in banana bread or a pumpkin etc to answer a reviewer the glaze is granulated sugar i use this almost always with sweet breads depending on what type of bread i substitute orange juice for lemon juice that is a great pairing with banana or any spice bread if you put the glaze on as soon as it comes out of the oven it sets to a somewhat crunchy sugar toppingdelicious
5,looking forward to baking this sounds delicious thx for helpful tips
5,this is so delicious its a perfect blend of sweet and tart it was so easy to make and it was very light and moist i did roli the blueberries in flour and used x sugar for the glaze i served it with a scoop of lemon sherbet what a great summer dessert
5,absolutely delicious made loaves froze one used freshly picked blueberries did not have any milk so i used c fat free milk and low fat half and half doubled recipe worked fine
5,this is a great recipe i made it today fresh blueberries fresh lemons and zest and walnuts delish thank you for this recipe my st time to make a blueberry bread definitely will make again sugar for the icingconfectioners butter softened not melted and add a little flour to the blueberries st before folding into the batter
5,this was excellent will make again and again
5,oh my this bread is awesome i added some lemon extract to it it is so moist and delicious i will be making this again
5,this was very good doubled the recipe to make loaves added about tsp lemon extract and used chopped pecans for the nuts i felt the nuts seemed out of place but everyone else seemed to not mind since this was my first time making blueberry anything i followed others suggestions and dusted my blueberries with flour before adding to the mixture i bake often for my husbands work and this was definitely the favorite will make again
5,ive made this several times use fresh blueberries i also make mini loaves out of this vs the big loaf turns out great i use degrees and cut bake time down to mins depending awesome recipe its a hit
5,i am not a baker this was wonderfully easy so delicious keep these kind coming
5,the best now one of my goto recipes
5,easy and yummy
5,super delicious will be making it again did not use nuts and it was still yummy super moist and full of flavorwondering if i can use blackberries with this recipe anyone tried iother fruits
5,so good to eliminate the bread not releasing from the pan do this cut waxed paper to fit the bottom of the pan after you spray the pan bottom to hold the wax paper tightly spray the paper after it is in the pan after baking run a knife around the sides to release the bread turn the pan upside down and the bread will slide outpeal off the wax paper do not spray the sides of the pan to allow the batter to rise and form a nice loaf i do this for all of my dessert breads i double this recipe and pour it into x pans and freeze of the loaves if making a single recipe i use a x pan if doubling i cut the sugar to cups and i dont add nuts at all i brush the glaze over the sides and then drizzle the rest of the glaze over the top wonderful recipe
5,made this todayi could hardly wait for it to coolmade with white whole wheat flourtasted greatimake all my breakfast breadsthis one will be a regular
5,so moist and so good do to my sons severe milk allergies i used earth balance in place of the butter and rice milk i also used mini loaf pans and baked for minutes i did not make the glaze it did not need any it was so good without it it was gone within the first couple of hours
5,delicious very moist with a similar texture to pound cake
5,this is very good quick bread my daughterinlaw raises her own blueberries so i always get some when they are ripe to make this special bread
5,heavenly plenty of lemon flavor i did not have zest so i increased lemon juice by tbsp and decreased milk by the same amount it definitely needs the longer cooking time so dont rush it my husband said it was a perfect balance of lemon and sweet thanks to fhquilting for tip about lining the bottom with waxed paper it made taking it out of the pan a breeze
5,this is delicious i will make it again and again ad infinitum lol
5,i have made this many many times over the years
5,its perfect ive made this quite a few times one as a side to brunch lunch and the other as a decadent dessert when i add a vanilla lemon buttercream icing its wonderful i add a ts of almond extract and i suspend the blueberries in flour before adding them to the batter
5,ive made this numerous times and it always turns out moist with just the right mix of tart and sweet since it doesnt specify powdered sugar i use granulated which gives it a clear glaze rather than something more like a frosting yummy
5,i made this bread for a church function and it went together so fast that i decided to make another one for my family it is so good im not even a big fan of lemon and i loved it with the fresh lemon peel and juice it is such a great quick bread will be making this again
5,this bread is outstanding ive made it numerous times since the recipe was first published in and it always brings plenty of compliments its definitely a family favorite as a volunteer field editor for toh i highly recommend it
5,added a few extra blueberries it was delicious
5,excellent made bread and glaze according to recipe first time i made it in metal loaf pan and evidently did not grease pan adequatelylost the entire top of bread now i use a pyrex loaf pan and spray bottom and sides also need to wait t least minutes before inverting it is easy and delicious i before servingi warm it a few seconds in the microwave and put a little butter mixed with a good quality blueberry jam on itreally good
5,yes butter and flour a glass bread pan minutes baking seems pretty fine in my oven test with toothpick then minutes rest time in the pan on a wire rack finally cut out of the pan and cool on the rack the bread is super and glaze is not needed but would probably be excellent too
5,great recipe everyone who i make this for loves it i used the throwaway aluminum container and it worked perfectly fine i found it needed to cook a bit longer but my oven is a bit off couple of tips when the top was getting a bit brown i put a piece of aluminum foil on top and it ruined the beautiful top when i took it off so i decided to just lower the temp a bit and it seemed to do the trick next time i wont put any foil on top also flour the blueberries before mixing in so they dont fall to the bottom
5,i love this bread so moist and flavorful next time i will try baking in two small loaves rather than one big loaf
5,this is easy and tastes soooooooooooo delicious i will file this under best
5,i am making this for the second time today it is very flavorful and moist i am going to try a powdered sugar and lemon glaze this time on a cooled loaf just to experiment
5,i make this during summer blueberry season with fresh berries and fresh lemon juice its a huge hit everywhere and lots of people have asked for the recipe the glaze makes it really awesome hint gently shake blueberries with t of flour from the recipe to keep them from sinking i use a slightly larger loaf pan than what is called for definitely a keeper
5,i just made this today exactly as directed it turned out perfect and is absolutely delicious it really filled that x pan and i was worried it would spill over but it didnt i set the timer for minutes and it wasnt quite done so i left it in for close to minutes longer this is a keeper i read after it was in the oven about coating the blueberries with flour but luckily didnt have problems with then sinking to the bottom
5,i have made this bread a few times and it is a definite favorite i even like to sprinkle some coarse sugar on top of the glaze for a little crunch has anyone tried to freeze the loaf and can tell me if it keeps i freeze pumpkin and other breads all the time but i was wondering how this one would hold up
5,absolutely delicious
5,perfectly delicious my family loves it it is pretty as well as tasty i am making it again third time this season but leaving out the nuts as i am making a different kind of bread that really needs nuts and i want people to have a nutfree option
5,made these today very moist and delicious
5,delicious added tbs vanilla it was amazing
5,absolutely the best blueberry bread i have ever eaten it was out of the oven and we ate it up so fast i just made a nd loaf ps to the person who commented that her blueberries fall to the bottom of the pan i used frozen blueberries in my recipe did not need to thaw them out and the blueberries stayed put and did not sink to the bottom
5,i recall making this bread and if i remember correctly id used miniature loaf pansi greased and floured the loaf pans used if using other pans i suggest one to two x loaf pans greased and floured id used the peel of large lemon cups fresh or frozen blueberries with cup allpurpose flour mixed in with the berries to prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the loaves id used cup lemon juice and cup sugar and i cooled the bread at least minutes so that bread had a chance to settle i glazed the loaves as soon as they came out of oven id probably bake the miniature loaves to minutes and the loaves at least to minutes i used my cake tester to test the loaves and made sure that the cake tester came out clean this recipe is a good one thank you for sharing this recipe delowenstein
5,i substitute sliced cranberries instead of blueberries in the fall
5,really yummy and easy a nice change from banana bread didnt change a thing
5,very good i used only cup of sugar in the bread and used powered sugar for the glaze
5,this is the absolute best blueberry bread the lemon juice and zest very nicely complements the blueberries regardless of the size of your loaf pan i suggest setting the timer to minutes then checking thereafter as minutes is too long as a starting point
5,loved this cake very lemony and moist used frozen blueberries from our patch and followed recipe exactly i agree with one of the other reviewers to start checking for doneness after about minutes thanks for another great recipe
5,fabulous bread i was out of milk so used c nonfat plain greek yogurt t baking soda also i didnt use the lemon rind but with the lemon glaze it was very deliciously lemony i did heat the glaze until the sugar dissolved only baked it for minutes but split the recipe into smaller pansthis was the best sweet bread i have ever tasted was so light we ate two loaves in one afternoon mom and kids will definitely make it again
5,great use of bananas amp blueberries yummy
5,fabulous turns out perfectly every time
5,cant say i followed the recipe to a t as i had half a lime and didnt know what to do with it i followed the recipe as written but used lemonlime juice and peel this is a wonderful recipe and will definitely make again
5,i made the blueberry bread into blueberry muffins i didnt made the glaze for the top i did add more berries then the recipe call for they were delicious my husband took them to work and passed them out to coworkers several people ask for the recipe this will be my go to recipe for blueberry muffins thanks taste of home cooks
5,wonderful pound cake like texture great flavor tweaked a bit used oil instead of butterprefer a finer crumb healthcalorie benefitsalso used pulp from lemons as well to pump up flavorno nuts in pantrythank you for a great recipe
5,rave reviews from church members
5,this is a five star personal favorite i never make the glaze its plenty sweet without
5,i substituted orange juice and orange zest since i am not a lemon person and it was wonderful will definitely make again
5,ive made this several times now and its gone before it has time to cool i use extra lemon in both the bread and the glaze to give it a yummy tart flavor
5,i have made this twice now omitting nuts due to allergies and my husband says it is one of the best baked goods he has ever had he loved it i made it once in a loaf pan the second time i doubled the recipe and made it in a bundt for a dinner party it was devoured and i was begged for the recipe this is going to be made for many years to come
5,really delicious followed the recipe except used cup whole wheat flour and cup flour love the lemon glaze its so simple and really adds a nice touch
5,wow fantastic recipe baked a loaf last evening without the nuts for a carryin at work today and it rapidly disappeared plus received several requests for the recipe this is definitely a recipe ill make many more timesalthough the glaze is fantastic ill probably omit it unless im going to serve this bread as a dessert just to save a few calories i took another reviewers advice and greased and floured the pan plus i lined the bottom of the pan with waxed paper to make removal a snap i would recommend this additional step to all its so frustrating when your loaf wont come out of the pan in one piece amazing recipe you wont be disappointed
5,wonderful recipe was perfect to mix up quick with a cup of leftover blueberries i left out the nuts and added a teaspoon of the lemon zest to the glaze yum
5,i love this bread and so do my children
5,omg i love this recipe everyone who tried it loved it too i will make this again
5,fragrant and moist ive made this bread several times now and it is consistently delicious
5,the very best lemon blueberry bread i have ever made made it for the th of july everyone loved it making it again today i triple it each time and it turns out great
5,this was a fantastic recipe followed directions exactly and bread disappeared quickly to the reviewer who said their blueberries fell to bottom of the pan the solution is to reserve tablespoon of your flour and put in sandwich bag then add your completely dry blueberries and coat them this prevents them from falling to the bottom of your panthis is a bread you could take anywhere and be proud thank you to the person who took the time to postshare with me
5,delicious and a quick easy recipe made recipe exact just had to sub teaspoons of lemon extract for the lemon zest as i didnt have any lemons on hand also didnt make the glaze personal preferencea definite keeper thanks julianne
5,this bread was delicious i doubled it to make for a bruncheveryone loved it and wanted the recipe yummy
5,excellent recipe so much flavor and very moist almost a dessert instead of a bread
5,i wasnt a fan of anything containing cooked blueberries until i tried this it has long been a favorite recipe of mine
5,this is an excellent recipe very moist and tasty definitely a keeper
5,excellent and easy recipe i did leave out the nuts because i didnt have any on hand no one missed them my fiance said that it was very moist and this recipe is definately a keeper thats a big compliment coming from him thanks for sharing the great recipe
5,this is my all time favorite lemon bread recipe its something i make quite a bit in the summer excellent
5,this bread is awesome amp my kids love the lemon glaze on top we pick and freeze blueberries just so we can have this all winter long
5,awesome ive been looking for lots of recipes with lemons in them and stumbled upon this one yesterday after i received an abundance of fresh lemons and grapefruits from someone in arizona i decided to make this and it turned out really nice and looked so pretty just make sure you greaseflour your pan well some of the bottom got stuck but i was able to piece it back together my boyfriend really liked this bread and said this loaf will get eaten in no time it has a nice heavy pound cake consistency and the glaze on top tastes great
5,incredible fairly easy to make make sure and flour the pan otherwise the bread will not come out of the pan
5,great lemony taste i added oz of applesauce
5,this is a great recipe i changed it up a bit i used self rising flour instead of regular and ommited the baking powder i only used a pinch of salt also and instead of the milk i used sour cream i like the tangy taste it gives and a richer texture my husband was really digging this recipe he isnt a big sweet eater this last time i made it i baked it in a spring form pan so it was more of a coffee cake
5,absolutely delicious just the way it is wouldnt change a thing definitely a familty fave
5,this bread is excellent i used fresh lemon juice and fresh blueberries that we pick and freeze to use all year long a little less sugar gave it a more lemony taste which is great with the blueberries we loved it without the glaze gooood stuff wildflower
5,this is one of those perfect recipes exactly as it is written made my first loaf yesterday and my second one a few minutes ago to share maybe
5,i do a full lb of ground beef but this is fantastic nice spin on potato soup with the change of the regular protein
5,made this for our football sunday in snowy upstate new york doubled it as i have grown men with some texas toast they all loved it guaranteed it will be done by the time the day is over thank you for a great recipe
5,my two kids can be fairly picky eaters they have recently decided they like cheeseburgers i saw this soup recipe and thought why not lets give this a try miracle of all miracles they both liked the soup instead of garnishing with sour cream we used a few spoonfuls of pickle relish because whenever my daughter orders a cheeseburger in a restaurant she orders it with pickles extra pickles and more extra pickles
5,very good to save using an extra pan i did not divide the butter i melted all of the butter to cook the vegetables in then stirred in the flour to cook it i then proceeded with the recipe as written
5,loved this i used mushroom broth and cheddar for my soup still turned out amazing and the hublet devoured it
5,i have made this delicious soup several times always very tasty my husband loves it and ànyone who tastes it wants recipe i think next i make i will add bacon crumbled i made exactly what the recipe called for but forgot to add the sour cream this time but still good thank you very much for sharing recipe
5,my kids absolutely love this recipe
5,after seeing this recipe for years i finally got around to making it yesterday and im sorry to say im kicking myself for not trying it much sooner i didnt have whole milk so i used can of evaporated milk and it was awesome best soup ever
5,the change i made was omitting celery and adding fresh red pepper in its place we loved this
5,so good i saved myself a pan though in the directions after i transferred the cooked ground beef i used a full pound and it was perfect to a plate i melted all of the butter called for in the same pan sauteed the onions carrots and celery and then sprinkled the flour over top after the veggies had softened i mixed in the diced raw potatoes and the cooked ground beef and then poured in the chicken broth it smelled so good while it was cooking once the potatoes were cooked through i added in the milk and i used shredded sharp cheddar instead of velveeta it is what i had on hand i also left out the basil and the sour cream and i am glad i did my whole family loved this and i will definitely be making it again it came together so fast a very hearty soup and so easy to make even without my changes this wouldve been delicious but i love how easy it is to alter it to your own tastes you cant go wrong with this recipe
5,i love this recipe but wont try dont like the time it tales to cook im disabled and limited to standing time
5,this soup was excellent it was my first time making a homemade soup and it made me a star with my husband and our son they loved it and so did i wonderful flavor
5,ive make this soup countless of time food day at work this soup is always requested i follow the recipe as written with the exception of adding what ever left over cheeses i have in the refrigerator along with the velveeta i am making this soup this week instead of buying the of potatoes im going to try using the cubed hash brown potatoes from the freezer section at the grocery store
5,pthis is the best soup recipe ever except i double the hamburger a friend a vegetarian leaves the hamburger out and she loves it that wayp
5,pi downloaded this recipe after recently receiving it in an email from taste of home i made it today and just love it my wife decided to add just a little yellow mustard to her bowl omg thats a much better cheeseburger flavorppgreat recipeppjames nmp
5,i like the simplicity of this recipe however i am a very busy mom so i did not make my own sauce rather i used mids brand pasta sauce with meat and mushrooms i then added about half a cup of water around the sides of the crockpot it turned out absolutely perfect and delicious we are a family of six and the portion size of this recipe was great also
5,this was great so nice to have it ready when we got home on a busy day we added extra sauce on top because wed like it that way
5,this is delicious love using the slow cooker in the fall and winter just be careful not to overlook some of my noodles got a bit crispy around the edges
5,excellent recipe and easy to put together like others i used italian sausage instead of beef taste preference otherwise made as is thank you
5,i have been making this for years it is always a hit i make it for pot luck dinners too and i never have left overs i use regular lasagna noodles though instead of the no cook lasagna and it turns out great its so easy and frees up my day to get other things done everyone things i work for hours over making it the left overs freeze great i was pleasantly surprises at that
5,so good love that this can be cooked in the crockpot add a salad and some garlic bread and supper is ready
5,always a hit i like to make a double batch and use half ricotta and half cottage cheese my husband like me to add ground italian sausage in
5,i took this in for a work luncheon and everyone really enjoyed it i did use half ricotta and half cottage cheese for the cheese blend i always make that combo when making lasagna its something my mom always did growing up and i feel makes a big different with the flavor
5,made this today and used jarred spaghetti sauce ricotta and the cottage cheese it turned out quite tasty although not the perfect squares that lasagna in a pan gives you much quicker to put together i did rim the slow cooker with aluminum foil to keep the edges from drying out as others suggested and it worked out fine
5,cooked this last night subbing oz canned tomatoes for sauce the lasagna was so delicious i was surprised at the good taste and the ease of this dish
5,love this recipe makes great leftovers too
5,stars with adjustmentsthis is the only way to make lasagna i tried making lasagna the traditional way what a painive been using this recipe for several years i use cheapy hunts spag sauce find it for cents sm can of tom paste and oz tom sauce and add seasonings and ingredients olives green beans red peppers to stretch etc as desired i usually make the sauce a day or two ahead ive used up to oz of cottage cheese and mixed with basil and seasonings and it was fine and different combinations of cheeses i use an oval crockpot with no problem and if im in a rush have cooked on high for hours and its perfect sorry so long i cant believe i havent reviewed before
5,this is an excellent lasagna recipe i am pretty much considered the crock pot queen of the family this recipe gets an a
5,i have made this several times it is perfect i use ricotta and cottage cheese my family loves it
5,wow this is the best lasagna ive ever made there were actual layers all my oven lasagnas have been very runny the flavor was really goodi forgot cottage cheese so that was vetoed from the recipe i only had lbs of hamburger meat so i added about lbs of jimmie dean all natural origanl pork sausage and a small can on sliced black olivesim impressed
5,this turned out awesome all my oven lasagnas turn out runny this was firm and held its layers like it should the flavor was greati forgot to buy cottage cheese so that was omitted and it was still good but ill be adding it in next time i used lbs of hamburger meat and lbs pork sausage and added a small can of sliced olives
5,this is really a tasty and easy lasagna recipe
5,i didnt put as much mozz cheese in it but my husband the bottomless pit ate a bowl of it and was full delicious
5,this was so dang good but have to say we changed it up a bit bc we thought it might be a bit bland for us added lb hot italian sausage mushrooms replaced the water w low sodium beef broth used tomato paste w basil garlic amp oregano added tsp each dried oregano basil amp italian seasoning tsp each red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper and added c italian shredded cheeses next time will use a crock liner to make removing it easier really great the next day too lots of flavor
5,very good lasagna i was surprised it was done in that short amount of time but it was i used spaghetti sauce as suggested by other reviews and used a slow cooker liner which made it easy to remove and made cleanup a breeze not sure what im going to with all the leftovers as its just my husband and me ill let it cool overnight and split it up in another portions three more meals headed for the freezer thank you lisa for the recipe
5,this was great next time i will add italian sausage for a bit more flavor but this is a keeper
5,this is amazingly good easy to make just put it together and forget it type recipe loved it
5,i love using my slow cooker and this was a hit a keeper
5,this was my first time making homemade lasagna i t was so easy and fun i also used a crock pot liner which made clean up a breezeto boost the flavor i used hot ground sausage mixed with packet of dry french onion soup mix and added i egg to the cheese mixture which made it easy to spreadi also used the regular lasagna noodles and turned out great flavorful
5,perfect make ahead recipe delicious just as written but easy to adapt for any family to make their favorite
5,this is the best slow cooker lasagna that i have tried i have a trick that i learned make a ring of foil wrap around the edges of the cooker before preparing lasagna only the sides not the bottom this way there are no noodle and cheese burnt spots on the edges it works awesome it also makes cleanup a breeze
5,this is now my all time favorite as well as my families favorite they said the would rather have this one than the one i had done for yearsit is great and simple and it doesnt take as much time to fix as it did my oven recipe the only change i made was i left out tomato paste and replaced with one ounce can of hunts no salt diced tomatoes with basilgarlic amp oregano this will be my forever lasagna a big shout out too lisa micheletti from collierville tennessee i am also from tennessee
5,this was good but next time i think i will use spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce for a little more flavor and will try ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese it came out great though i thought it would fall apart when scooped out but it didnt very easy i cooked it all day and it was fine
5,great tasting easy recipe my family loved it
5,easy to assemble i used a jar of spaghetti sauce with the water to thin the sauce worked fine
5,awsomemaking it for the second time using regular noodles used spaghetti sauce with diced tomatoeseasy and tastes great
5,this is easy and deliciousloved that it could go in the crock pot making it tonight for the nd time
5,pleasantly surprised i used an oval crock pot i was worried that the noodles wouldnt cook right because i had to overlap them in each layer turned out great i dont see how this dish could turn out dry there was plenty of moisture i cooked for hours my family liked it
5,i made the recipe just as directed and it turned our delicious moist and full of flavor i didnt have just plain oregano but i had the italian seasoning spice so i used it my family loved the recipe and ill certainly make it again
5,this is now my goto recipe i make it for special occasions and it never fails that someone wants the recipe before they go home
5,it was so easy my son who is so picky even loved it
5,this was so much easier to make than my regular lasagna recipe the pieces werent quite as pretty but the taste was fantastic
5,this was fantastic i will never make a traditional lasagna again i reduced the recipe by half and used can spaghetti sauce and an oz can of tomato sauce for the sauce i was pleasantly surprised by how much better this was in the cp
5,was in the process of making cabbagerolls and needed the oven space for them when i came across this recipe omg this is fabulous i added some green pepper pieces and zucchini i had on hand and am as i type am enjoying the slow cooked lasagna thank you for a fabulous keeper recipemmmmmmmmmmmmm
5,easy to get all of the ingredients togetherplug it in turn it on and forget about it for a few hours a keeper in my book
5,wowcooking lasagne is always a painbut now no problem
5,deliciously unbelievable i added mild italian sausage as suggested by another review loved it
5,for susiei have never like cottage cheese either but my sister in law made us lasagna one time with cottage cheese instead of ricotta and i loved it been making my lasanga that way ever since i ususally make this recipe in the oven but i think next time i will try it in the slow cooker
5,made this for dinner tonight we all agreed that its really good definately will make it again but will tweak it just a little w extra cheese and more seasoning italian blend maybe the flavor was just a little bland for us i used regular lasagna noodles and they worked just fine a keeper
5,i have made this recipe a couple of times this time i made it with bottled spagetti sauce and regular uncooked lazagna noodles it was great my boyfriend loved it said it was almost as good as my scratch
5,fixed this for my family visiting on a sunday they all loved it
5,i added italian sausage for the more meaty version plus a teaspoon of dried basil also substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese at the request of my wife definitely the best slow cooker lasagna recipe ive found
5,very tasty with a few tweaks used c water added tsp dry italian seasoning used regular noodles not the noboil kind used cups italian cheese blend instead of the individual mozzarella and parmesan was a little salty but otherwise was awesome
5,my husband thought this was the best lasagna even better then my recipe that takes forever for me to make i will be making this a lot
5,this is a good starter recipeas there is no taste as is i did everything in the recipe but added t zesty italian seasoning tsp basil tsp thyme tsp pesto mushrooms less than a c each black and green olives a good splash of white wine and balsamic vinegar i would use regular lasagna noodles run them under hot water to form to pandont boil them as the no cook gets to mushy and looses their form it would be great for a work pot luckwhere you want to keep it warm it makes a big batch and not recommended two people as you have to keep it in the crock to keep its formin the refrigerator
5,making for the second time it was great the first time but did add more seasonings and used cottage cheese and more italian cheese blend used a rectangle slow cooker that works great
5,this recipe was highlighted in a recent taste of home email and i had to try it it was excellent the recipe was a bit high in sodium so i chose to use unsalted butter i added mushrooms as my preferred cheeseburger is a mushroom cheeseburger and a bit of red pepper flakes for a little kick a shoutout to the wife of james with the suggestion of a adding a bit of mustard to the bowl just a skosh and to cincibetty for suggesting doubling the hamburger this recipe is destined for my next potluck

5,i love to bake but i had never made banana bread until thanksgiving of it turned out awful it wasnt sweet enough or have enough banana flavor to suit me i didnt give up i saw this recipe on your website and tried it it is magnificent my family loved it so much they wanted loafs for their christmas gifts i pretty much have to make it about every week now my coworkers love it my friends at church love it it is truly the best ever banana bread and easy to make thanks for publishing this recipe kristine from anthony kansas
5,incrediblei had to make a few changes i didnt have buttermilk and ran out of vinegar and lemon juice to make buttermilk so i used cup of milk and added tbsp of orange juice to it i also used large bananas so important that they are partially green not completely ripe and i also added cup of ground flax seed as well i also reduced the sugar from cups to just cup although you could still reduce it more i added a dash of nutmeg a dash of ground cloves and about tsp of cinnamon i really enjoyed reading everyones reviews and suggestions too it helped me with making my own changes thanks for a great starting point with this recipe its a keeper
5,i forgot to mention i used canola oil instead of vegetable oil
5,these disappear at my house with kids i did substitute sour cream for the buttermilk and made them as muffins cooking at degrees for minutes they are a hit i hate to admit it but i even threw away the old family recipe for this one
5,i first saw this recipe in the very first addition of toh which i still have i have made this several times for family and friends and they all love it thanks toh
5,this was delicious the only thing i would do different would be to double the sauce it soaks into the potatoes and then there is not enough to use with the pork this is definitely in my rotation
5,this recipe was a great dinner the most time consuming part was cutting up the potatos if you have not every made scalloped potatos its time consuming
5,a simple and comforting dish loved it
5,i made it for my coworkers and they loved it
5,i have been making this recipe for years its a favorite i sometimes make just the potatoes and substitute vegetable broth to serve vegetarians in my family delicious
5,i like to double the sauce so we have extra to top the pork chops with gravy i also increase the potatoes to cups
5,it was quick and easy to prepare i doubled the sauce as others had suggested ever since i made it my family has asked when we can have it again especially my husband who usually doesnt care for pork chops
5,doubled the gravy as suggested and it was ridiculously good i made it for the first time a few days ago and hubby is already asking for it again tonight this is now one of our favorite recipes
5,this recipe came out in taste of home magazine several years ago and i have been making it for my husband and our four children since then it is one of their very favorite meals my oldest daughter has been known to request it as her birthday dinner or on weekends when she comes home to visit this is easy to prepare and yummmy
5,no low fat alternative choices if you want real fluffy dumplings like your my mom made she made large ones
5,i made this and it is easy delicious and a favorite on a cold day
5,i made this tonight so good i sauteed fresh broccoli fresh sliced carrots and chopped celery i used milk also added a shake of garlic powder some dried parsley and some dried minced onion to the baking mix used a little bit more broth than stated so good will definitely be making again
5,superfly easy amp very good i made it even easier i think cubed small chicken breasts cooked in olive oil amp cavenders til done added the carrots and celery water better than boullion allowed to cook until veggies were a bit tender then dropped the dumplings on top my fussy eating daughter liked as well as the rest of the fam
5,so simple and delicious loved the flavors and how comforting the dish is
5,this is a great recipe i make it often and my family really likes it my son in law doesnt like scalloped potatoes but he really likes this dish its a great meal to make for a new mom i serve it with peas
5,omg this is a great recipe i used my own homemade chicken stock amp the potatoes were fabulous
5,this dish comes together very easily and is delicious my husband had servings he generally does not care for scalloped potatoes i know well be having this again and again thank you for sharing your recipe
5,this recipe has that authentic downhome flavor i doubled the gravy ingredients and added teaspoon fresh lemon juice and teaspoons kitchen bouquet just to give it the best color also i dont think it needs to cook as long as the recipe says i only cooked it hr
5,this recipe was greatvery quick and easy to make we will certainly make it again
5,this has been a family favorite ever since it was first publishedone of the first recipes i tried from toh i make the recipe as is with great results i use boneless chops the food processor makes quick work of slicing the potatoes
5,this banana bread is delicious i never made banana bread before but others ive tried have always been kind of dry this one is so moist and wonderful i used bananas powdered buttermilk cup each of nuts and choc chips and a touch of cinnamon so good very moist and delicious ill make this again for sure
5,amazing seemed like the outside of mine was getting very dark wile the middle was still a bit to moist anyone know why that would be i followed the recipe with no changes
5,this is an amazing recipe probably the best banana bread ive had my husband who doesnt even like banana bread very much liked this recipe the outside is crunchy right after it comes out of the oven but then it softens after it cools so i didnt think it was too crispy at all
5,it was so good i made it twice in one night i had to share this with others so i made one for my daughters house
5,super flavor moist and yummy
5,i made this last night and it truely is the best banana bread recipe ever i did a few things differently i added bananas plus some cinammon i didnt have any buttermilk but i did pour in some organic soy milk it was so moist on the inside and a nice texture on the outside will definitely pass around and make this again
5,i often make this bread it is so yummy as in every bread i bake i substitute applesauce for the oil and use about the sugar the last time i baked this added white chocolate chips that was really good
5,i have a family favorite banana bread recipe which is probably still the ultimate favorite however this bread is excellent as well and the reason i like it so much is that it is much lower in fat than the old family version for having only cup of oil in what turns out to be a very large loaf i thought this was an exceptionally moist and flavorful bread i used bananas instead of since it was suggested by so many other reviewers otherwise i followed the recipe exactly skipping only the nut since my family doesnt care for them mine actually tested done after hr and mins the outer crust was slightly crunchy but not hard will definitely keep this recipe and make it again
5,i am always looking for a great banana bread recipe and i have found it this was delicious and very moist i used bananas added chocolate chips and used milk and vinegar instead of the buttermilk will definitely be making this one again
5,this is hands down the best banana bread i have ever eaten or made it is my new goto recipe since last year i get many and often requests at church to bring it to any gettogether and to make it for bakesales amazing
5,i made this today and its amazing it is by far the best recipe i have tried this is definitely a keep
5,probably the best banana bread recipe i have found my kids loved it and it was gone in a few hours aside from omitting the nuts i didnt change a thing in the recipe
5,made as written it looked overcooked but tasted wonderful has a nice dark sugarery crust is that a word
5,i have had this recipe since the s it was in the bon appetite magazine excellent banana bread
5,this bread is absolutely delicious i agree with the title it is the best ever banana bread i leave out the nuts and add a bit more banana but other than that its perfect as is
5,absolutely delicious and soooo easy the leftovers thickened up in the fridge so it was even better the next day i cant wait to make it again
5,a whole lot easier than the chicken and dumplings my grandmother made it took me years to get her recipe right the only difference is i add milk or half and half to the broth after it is done i prefer the milky broth to the clear
5,our family loves comfort food made this in the fall on a cool evening was a great dish easier to make than alot of other chicken n dumpling recipes we used precooked rotisserie chicken and just shredded it worked out great
5,yall just changed my recipe for my chicken and dumplins
5,very similar to my mils recipe which i loved i did use milk thats what i had cooked the dumplings minutes uncovered and minutes covered i think thats what she did and i added a cup of peas for more veggies true comfort food
5,love love love this recipe super easy and so good i use a bisquick cheese garlic mix and it adds an addictive flavor to this great as a dutch oven camping treat on a cold campout precook the chicken and you heave a hearty meal in minutes over the campfire
5,ive made this a couple times and its on the menu for our frigid weather coming tomorrow my three year old loves it and it is great comfort food use a rotisserie chicken for convenience and just shred it really easy to make and a family winner
5,to stewartthe lumps of dough are dumplingsmade northern stylestrips of dough southern and amish styledont like themdont eat themreal simple to understand
5,it amazes me how some think their way is always the only way i grew up with a southern georgian dad and a northern canadian mom the flat dumplings versus drop dumplings fight was settled early northern drop dumplings won hands down even my soulfood loving dad admitted the flat dumplings which were like mushy noodles to me werent as tasty as the light fluffy biscuity drop dumplings made from scratch i dont know and it may be good but mom never used boxed mixes of anything
5,exple thanks for the dumpling recipe i really dont like the ones made with bisquick any more and stewart and lolygagtx youre talking about cooked pie dough and those are the most disappointing awful dumplings not ive ever tasted i ordered chicken and dumplings when we went to cracker barrel and we have never gone back horrible food a real dumpling is basically a biscuit cooked on top of a stew just like the recipe states they are fluffy and delicious and always have egg baking powder and milk always
5,nancy your recipe was quick and definitely delicious thanks for your lovely recipe for a delicious amp quick dinner after a busy day

5,this is only the second time ive made this and it is so easy and good this time though i added a can of cream of mushroom soup and a oz bag of edamame
5,although my family absolutely loves dumplings ive never been able to make them they either end up undercooked or spread out all over the pan like soup these worked out perfectly though reading through the comments i went ahead and let them cook minutes without lifting the lid then i tested them with a toothpick to check for doneness and they were just right when i make a new recipe the big test is whether my family would want me to make it again i received a resounding yes on this one thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe
5,i have made the cream of chicken soup version and this one minus the vegetables because the kids will only eat veggies separate i honestly thought they would like the cream of chicken soup better but all three of them and the hubby liked this one much more
5,i have made this recipe and one that uses refridgerated biscuits and cream of chicken soup my children and husband all liked this recipe better i did not use the vegetables because my kids will not eat their veggies if i put them in a casserole or soup
5,i had four cups of rotisserie chicken in my freezer that i wanted to make good use of and this brutal unending winter makes me yearn for comfort foods i searched the internet and came across this recipe which i followed with the exception of the chicken amount it turned out great very filling and satisfying definitely a keeper
5,this recipe was loved by my husband and my two picky girls i used carrot onions and peas in my recipe
5,this was a big hit with my family easy to fix and taste is great
5,i was in a time crunch last night and remembered i had printed this recipe out and was glad i didi am a sucker for biscuits and that was why i wanted something super fast easy and delishanother thing you could do to make it even faster is use frozen biscuitsvery nice recipe will be making this again
5,super fast and easy way to get a hearty meal on the table this tastes like it has been simmering all day i will be making this recipe many many times its a keeper
5,this is absolutely delicious i never had luck making chicken and dumplings and gave up a long time ago i decided to try once again the dumplings turned out perfect i left them cook minutes to be on the safe side like some of the others suggested so glad i did since any time i did make dumplings they were always full of doe in the middle husband says i have to make this again which i definitely will i also added onions because we are big onion fans excellent recipe and is great in a time cruncher thanks for posting

5,tired this and making it a lot we love it and it is so tasty and easy to make i added tarragon for extra flavor and makes a difference is so good my husband loves it added tarragon to the dumplings also you must try this

5,wow what happened to all the reviews i saw here a week or ago theres only review showing here now this is the best banana bread no kidding use bananas to have an overflowing cupful i used an aluminumcolored loaf pan you will love it lori in wi
5,ethis recipeveryone loved this recipe when i made it for mothers day it really is the best ever banana bread cathleen woodall of flordia
5,i make this bread anytime there are ripe bananas on hand the buttermilk makes this bread moist and flavorful
5,i make this batches at a time or with a family of i wouldnt get a slice at all i make them amp give them as birthday gifts for all my friends everyone looks forward to their birthday since the know theyll get a loaf

5,this truly is the best ever it is easy to make and fantastic its a hit every time
5,this certainly lives up to its name my very good recipe of banana bread just got replaced by the best ever banana bread recipe thanks
5,definitely lives up to its name i followed the recipe exactly and it turned out amazing
5,it was simply delicious the taste of banana is very subtle
5,this is the absolute very very best of all banana bread recipes it is to die for super moist and flavorful and quite addicting so happy to have found this gem of a recipe
5,easy to make and delicious
5,even more delish if you add chocolate chips ive made this several times and everyone always raves over it
5,this is a wonderful simple recipe however the recipe does not call for the pan to be floured as well as greased mine stuck to the bottom of the pan so in the future i will either dust the pan with flour or use parchment paper
5,i have made this bread over and over again i have changed a few things to make it healthier i use whole wheat flour and only c sugar i also use applesauce instead of oil and add c flax seed it definately lives up to its name
5,this was brought to me as muffins after a motorcycle accident they are the best i add extra nuts and more bananas but they always turn out great
5,very tasty and so easy i didnt have carrots so i thawed some frozen mixed vegetables and added them in with the broth i also used leftover turkey i didnt use anything reduced sodium or reduced fat so it was definitely salty enough
5,this was so incredibly good my whole family raved about this well definitely be making it again and again i was surprised at how simple the recipe was to taste sooooo good i let mine simmer extra long to be sure the dumplings were really done so it cooked down to a nice chicken stew consistency i only used oz of chicken breast so between less chicken and simmering down quite a bit i ran short on servings of the actual stew to go with all those dumplings but other than that it was perfect delicious
5,love this recipe for picky eaters amp kiddos plus mommies trying to watch their waistline finally one meal for everyone i used canned chicken and added some ground fresh spinach leaves getting in the greens is never easy with toddlers
5,did not have bisquit mix to make the dumplings but i did have a box of potato dumpling mix so i did a substitute and everyone loved it will add more broth next time for a soupier consistency
5,loved by boys and a dad cant believe how good the sauce turned out so quick too we could add other veggies next time too thanks for a great recipe
5,i added about of a large onion and some garlic saltjust a pinch my sons favorite is chicken and dumplingshe loves this recipe thank you nancy for sharing it with us
5,i make this probably once a month because we love it so much
5,i cut the recipe in half and it was very good the only thing i did different was to add some chopped onion to the vegetables and then cook them for minutes in a little bit of canola oil i was regretting that i didnt have any cream of chicken soup to thicken the broth but i found it was not needed the broth was a perfect consistency after the dumplings were cooked
5,i made this recipe last night using everyones review suggestions adding poultry seasoning a little salt etc i also used a precooked rotisserie chicken from the store to speed the process up it was absolutely delicious the only thing next time i will make the biscuits and not cheat by using a homestyle refrigerated brand its just not the same as homemade kids loved the meal too big plus
5,my hubby loved this i chopped a small onion to saute with the celery and carrots i also used olive oil instead of coating my dutch oven with cooking spray delicious
5,ive tried several times over the years to find a chicken and dumpling recipe like my mother used to make and was always disappointed with the results until i found this recipe i dont always put vegetables in it but it is delicious either way anytime i cook a chicken in the crockpot i always put a single serving of shredded chicken with some broth in the freezer and make a small batch for my lunch when im home by myself
5,this is very good and easy to make in a hurry i cook a whole chicken in my crock pot and debone and soup is ready to go in just a short time
5,this recipe is great and so easy i ahve neer made chicken and dumplings before and my husband was a little skepticle everyone was plesantly supprised and satisfied after dinner was done
5,first time my chicken and dumplings have came out i used a rotisserie chicken and added the skins to add more flavor added onion with the celery and carrotsand i also added garlic because we like garlic and it was wonderful everyone said they would like to have it again thanks
5,my family loved it definitely making it again
5,this was great and easy to make
5,simple and delicious i have made this several times over the past couple of years
5,this was very good the broth thickens up as it cools i cut the recipe in half but made the full amount of dough for dumplings and there were large dumplings for us
5,i love making this recipe it is ssoo easy and tastes great i sometimes make it when taking a meal to someone it is always so well received
5,this was delicious and so simple to make i bought a rotisserie chicken from the deli which gave the recipe some extra flavor will definitely be making this again
5,i really enjoyed this recipe
5,another favorite
5,my family loved this recipe the only thing i did differently was to season with extra salt and pepper we will definitely make this again soon
5,very good i also added some chopped onions and when i added the dumplings i also threw some frozen peas in i also added red potatoes and loved that my year gobbled up an entire bowl and then ate some of my husbands dinner later
5,love love loved this the definition of quick and easy comfort food
5,i like a lot of veggies in mine so i added a handful more carrots one small onion and a cup of frozen peas i stirred in the peas before adding the dumplings as the other readers did since im a spice girl too i used a rounded tsp of the poultry seasoning and added tsp salt plus a pinch more pepper delicious
5,everyone at work was sick so before i caught the cold i wanted to make some hearty chicken soup i added tons more broth and spices to give the soup an extra kick i also added egg noodles which turned out great the dumplings did not come out as planned but still tasted great just did not look that appetizing
5,the whole family just loved this the left overs were even better after sitting in the fridge all night it really thickened up this is a really quick and easy meal
5,made this the other night and everyone loved it the perfect comfort food i read everyones reviews and suggestion it really made a difference i used some cream of chicken soup which helped with thickness i also used some onion and also peas also let the dumplings cook extra long they turned out great there was so much leftover i just reheated the next night and made more dumplings i cant wait to make it for my college daughter to send back with her
5,i have made this recipe several times and always with rave reviews its so easy and soo good its a wonderful comfort food in cold weather
5,i followed all the directions exactly except i cooked the biscuits for minutes and they turned out great my husband and i loved it very much this recipe is a keeper
5,very easy and the whole family loved it next time i will try adding some cream of chicken soup to thicken it a little
5,i have never made this recipe exactly how it says but i use it as a guide i dont add carrots i use celery and onions the biggest change i make is using homestyle canned biscuits i cut each biscuit into thirds and toss in flour which helps to thicken the soup my husbands favorite
5,i am going to make these amazing cookies tonight for my family i know that they will love them i will enjoy them too
5,perfect after adding extra spices
5,we have made these for many years its a great recipe i use a small cookie scoop and then it makes more cookies the spice is just right so you can taste it but its not overwhelming my young daughter has always said this is her favorite cookie
5,best cookies our new favourites
5,wonderful i will definately make this again
5,this is one of my favorite recipes i make it all the time in the fallwinter it tastes like it took hours to make but is very quick since i live alone i usually make half the recipe which gives me yummy leftovers for lunch the following day
5,this has been a great receipe i only changed one ingredent and that was to add range free chicken broth that is fat free and sodium is low jp in wy
5,i use a stock pot instead of a dutch oven and i follow the recipe on the baking mix box for the dumplings the dumplings have always come out puffy and light this is a favorite
5,i used regular bisquick and they turnout out perfect maybe skip the poultry seasoning but mine didnt seem to stick to the dumplings they were even better as leftoverschefleslie
5,kids loved this one i would add more broth next time though
5,i cant imagine chiken n dumplings wo sauteed onions so i added a chopped onion wthe carrots amp celery yummy
5,very good i used leftover turkey instead of the chicken regular biscuit mix and salt free all purpose seasoning
5,everyone loved themamazing
5,perfect flavor and texture strong ginger and molasses flavors crispy edges and gooey middles
5,love these cookies but for whatever reason mine dont flatten at all they stay big and round everyone else has the opposite issue it seems
5,these cookies are the best cookies and my favorite i literally make batches a week and they only last or days and i honestly have never written a review on anything in my life so take that to the bank
5,i was looking for a nice soft ginger cookie and these are perfect ive used this recipe twice now and theyve turned out excellent both times highlyrecommend these
5,wow this cookie was delicious easy to make soft didnt stay around but days this one is a keeper
5,the best gingermolasses cookies ive ever made i multiplied the measurements by and it makes dozen even with my scoop size which is around tablespoons in size my dad loves em and hes not easy to please with cookies ive made a lot of fail cookies theyre either too moist and somehow bake up crunchy or doughs that are too dry and flavourless this has a lot of great flavour and you dont have to be shy about kicking up the flavour i increased the cinnamon and ginger in this recipe to our tastes and added a teaspoon of vanilla with amazing results a cookies
5,this website is great cant wait to find more recipes
5,i made absolutely zero changes to the recipe i was tempted at the end to roll the dough balls into raw sugar but i stuck with the granulated the resulting cookies are crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside perfectly spiced
5,when i was in middle school i found this recipe and subsequently used to make it every year when i found out i had a gluten allergy i had to stop making them they didnt have good gf flours then however this year when planning cookie gifts for christmas i remembered these cookies and found this online version of the recipe i love these cookies and so does anyone who i make them for this time to avoid my hands getting so sticky from shaping the balls i took out about a tablespoon of dough and threw it into my sugar bowl and coated it with sugar and then shaped the ball this really helped speed up the process and my hands didnt get so messy also i recommend taking the cookies off of the pan almost immediately with the last pan i didnt do this immediately and the cookies collapsed slightly
5,i never write reviews but these are amazing in fact this is the first review i have ever written because i never think its worth it but these cookies are worth writing a review for if you are thinking about making them do it
5,so yummy with a cup of tea nice and spicy better the next day
5,have had this recipe from one of your magazines for a long long time its a family favoritedoesnt stay around longit goes fast
5,use this recipe a lot for my daughter bake sales she hadevery easy and moist breadlove it
5,awesome i have been baking for plus years and this is the best banana breadmy son stationed in japan loves to bake and i will send him this recipe
5,weve made this several times and we love it ive made it with powdered buttermilk when i didnt have actual buttermilk and didnt want to wait until i went to the store there was very little difference
5,delicious
5,i followed this recipe to the t im making this for thanksgiving my husband has been bagging me to make him some banana bread i am a regular subscriber of taste of home i knew where to search for the best recipe thank u for help making my husband happy
5,i made this for the for the first time last night it wont be the last i used splenda baking blend for the sugar and it turned out fantastic yum
5,this really is the best ever it lives up to its name i put some chocolate chips in it and my husband loved it i will make this over and over again
5,very moist and tasty
5,i made this banana bread and have had numerous people ask for the recipe everyone agrees that this is the best banana bread they have ever eaten i have made several to give at christmas
5,i am not a chocolate chip fanso i added cinnamon chipswe are huge cinnamon fans in this house
5,no buttermilk in the fridge so i made my own with milk and vinegar i doubled the recipe and left out the nuts i used a couple of silicon loaf pans and the edges of the bread were a little dark i should have maybe knocked the temp down a little to compensate for the dark pan or checked it a little earlier for doneness overall though the bread turned out very nicely i have another bananas on the brink so ill make a couple more double batches and work out my flaws ill go get some buttermilk too as i would like to see how that would change the flavor i imagine that this will be my goto banana bread recipe in the future thanks
5,i made muffins theyre delish set the oven to degrees and bake for minutes the minimuffins took about minutes
5,this is a really good banana bread recipe just a couple things that you need to know the bake time at the top says mins and in the recipe itself it says hr mins or until the tooth pick comes out clean i have made this times and it takes about mins at the most at degrees let the bread rest in the pan for mins thing remove and cool on a cooling rack the bottom tends to stick a little when using a spray so use shortening or butter to grease the pan
5,i added chocolate chips and the taste was incredible
5,love this first bite i took i said wow this is the best banana bread i have ever eatten and then i looked that the recipe and laughed because that was the name
5,it was a chilly september morning so baking was on my list the cookies are scrumptious but i didnt feel they had enough ginger so i added about tsp of ginger paste that was in my refrigerator aldi find i also use thicker coarse colored sugars in a rusty red autumn color they have the coarse sugar at tjmax or marshalls far cheaper than anyone i took them out of my convection oven when they were soft and voila the center is soft and the outer edges are crispy my house is toasty warm with the taste of home so reminiscent of my youth when my mama was baking up a storm
5,i used c of bacon fat with c crisco for the butter and increased the ginger the bacon imparts a slightly smokey flavor which nicely complements the ginger
5,these cookies were delicious my entire family enjoyed them soft chewy and crunchy this was my first time doing this type of cookie and it was easier than i thought i would recommend chilling the dough before rolling i will use this recipe for gingerbread men thank you
5,the only problem with these cookies is how fast they were consumed delicious
5,my family loves these cookies they are so soft and delicious
5,these are our favorite ginger cookies and ive been making them for years family and friends look forward to them every christmas and i have to make them no matter what other cookies i make i make a few changes to best suit our taste but nothing that significantly alters the recipe and they come out perfect every time i use crisco butter flavored shortening to keep the cookies from flattening out too much c granulated sugar and c brown sugar tsp each ginger and cinnamon leaving the amount of cloves the same roll the dough into inch balls to get cookies and only dip the tops of the dough balls in granulated sugar before baking finding that adds enough for us the recipe doubles easily which is good so we get some for us to enjoy after giving lots away
5,very delicious we loved them ill make them again and again
5,great chewy crispy texture and perfect ginger flavor
5,best ginger cookie ive made love the soft chewy texture
5,my family absolutely loved this recipe my son told me he doesnt care for gingerbread cookies but he really likes these cookies winner thanks you
5,these cookies are fantastic i read through the comments before starting and was worried about the issue with the runny batter spreading cookies etc but i proceeded anyway and the dough turned out perfectly and there was absolutely no major spreading in the oven whatsoever i did follow the tips about creaming the butter and sugar for minutes and also chilled the dough for minutes before scooping and baking im really not sure why some people had such problems with it maybe their butter was too soft i will say that for my familys taste i did need to add additional spice i added a whole extra teaspoon of the ginger and increased the cinnamon to a full teaspoon and honestly i couldve done with even more which is why after tasting the test batch i rolled them in a cinnamon sugarpumpkin pie spice mixture the texture is exactly what i was looking for soft and chewy with just a touch of crispiness on the outside these will absolutely be in my christmas cookie line up for every year to come
5,this is a great recipe the dough formed perfectly for me it almost felt like playdoh i didnt have any ground cloves on hand so i left them out and they taste just fine they needed and additional ish minutes in the oven but thats no biggie at all this is defiantly my new favourite cookie recipe
5,these were fantastic like others i could have used more ginger and cinnamon i followed the directions and creamed the butter and sugar for min and i baked them maybe min and they are still really soft i will be making these againthank you
5,this is a great recipe like others i increased the spices by using the spice amounts in tartines ginger cookies t giniger t cloves t cinnamon and t black pepper also t salt and slightly less sugar than a cup they are incredible and a real keeper recipe i will use again and again they also ship well
5,these are absolutely perfect my family are not huge on fall spices so the amount in the recipe in each are just good enough love the texture the flavor and easy to follow this recipe is a keeper
5,fantastic i added a tiny bit more sugar they are so so so so good a little kick to them very rich but delicious
5,great recipe my family loves them i keep seeing comments on the sugar amount its cup of sugar for the cookies the additional sugar is to roll the cookies in once you have them formed into the ball i put mine in a tupperware container place one cookie at a time in it roll it around to cover the cookie then i place the cookie on a cookie sheet and bake the amount of sugar changes depending on how big or how many cookies i make i believe thats why theres no amount for it i usually start with a cup and go from there best of luck
5,tastes excellent rich flavor from the cinnamon cloves and ginger combination
5,we opted to make these smaller using a mini ice cream scoop which yielded or more i mixed white and demerara sugar real molasses is hard to find in our part of india so i used melted palm jaggery superb recipe
5,we love these cookies we didnt have molasses so we used all brown sugar and added a little corn syrup for liquid we doubled the amount of ginger and rolled them in granular bakers sugar so they had yummy crunchy sugar on the outside theyre so good everybody loves themespecially still slightly warm from the oven
5,these cookies are a favorite of my husbands and ive been making them for years i freeze the dough balls before baking so they dont spread excessively sometimes i use dried ginger along with the ground theyre always so soft and dont last long at our house
5,ashen i think youre new on toh some suggestions for you kiddo after youve cooked baked etc for some years youll realize that measurements are common in recipes so youre going to have to accept that find a tsp measuring spoon or use
5,these are amazing ive made these times and they spread a bit however i accidentally added
5,ashen my dude you just need to take a measuring cuptsp and use it times these cookies were delicious and didnt give me any problems despite my use of gf allpurpose flour
5,first attempt at these today a success and im no baker followed recipe to a t but did sift the flour and dry ingredients together as my ginger and cloves were kinda old note when it says softened butter i did not microwave the butter it was just room temp so took awhile before it appeared light and fluffy in fact i was skeptical about it took awhile to achieve light texture and was definitely not fluffy proceeded on with the room temperature egg etc i did use the hand mixer for adding in the first cups of the flour mixture but then switched to stirring then i made all the balls up then i got out a little bowl and put cup sugar in as a guesstimate i rolled the balls in that it was more than enough i baked mine minutes in a gas oven took them out as the cookies cracked and puffed up they are just perfect outside is firm but inside is soft best ginger cookie recipe ever hope they will stay soft
5,i made these cookies this morning and they are just great there is no other word for it the reader that mentioned all the things she did to it and they didnt spread out i can see why just make the recipe no different flours etc when i make them again i might add a little more ginger is all
5,the cookies are wonderful i used cold butter and mixed it in a stand mixer to soften with the sugar and the cookies did not spread just perfect
5,i made these one night they didnt last long and i was asked to make another double batch just the recipe ive been looking for crunchy on the outside chewy on the inside first time i made them i rolled them in white sugar as directed in the recipe when i made the double batch i rolled half of them in white and half in brown sugar omg tastes like a creme brulee topping great recipe barbara
5,im a professional baker and this is the best soft ginger cookie recipe ive ever tried i followed the recipe exactly i tried like some others suggested to flatten the cookies a bit before baking but i got better results by not flattening like the recipe says i used a oz cookie scoop to portion out roll in sugar and bake as instructed they came out perfectly highly recommend this recipe
5,i made an account on here just to rate these cookies star they were easy to make and came out perfectly ive never made ginger snap cookies before but they came out incredible could recommend this to everyone
5,love this i had to make a second batch because my family ate them all and i had none left over to give away the first time i made them the dough was dry but i think thats because i had to place it in the frige to step out the nd time it wasnt dry but both time absolutely delicious its going to be one of my go to cookie recipes
5,i have made this cookie just as the recipe says and it turns out perfect every time this is my husbands favorite cookie i always double it each time i make it i do not flatten the cookie balls at all i bake for minutes and leave on the cookie sheet about two minutes after taking them out of the oven they look just as the picture shows and taste fantastic i highly recommend this recipe
5,the ease of the recipe was great and having all ingredients but one in the house made it enjoyable to make the cookies looked exactly like the cookies in the video the texture was spot on crunchy outside and gooey inside
5,oh my this cookie was just what was needed on this cold rainy day i was unexpectedly out of regular sugar and so used demerara for both the actual cookie and for rolling the cookies had that bit of crunch from the sugar and were heavenly i am not sure i will ever make them any other way now thank you
5,is there anything i need to do differently for high altitude these were awesome to start but didnt know if i need to alter the recipe for living in denver colorado
5,made these for my sons they loved them and ask me to make them for their offices now if i ask them and my husband what kind of cookies they want it is always these their office mates even request them definitely a winner
5,so good i prefer more spice flavor so i add more ginger and cinnamon do watch the baking time i try to take them out just before they appear done for that chewy soft texture once cooled and set these are a classic around the holidays but they are also a great summer picnic cookie with a glass of lemonade
5,excellent recipe my husband loves cookies with ginger and molasses and these were a huge hit i didnt make any changes to the recipe watch the cooking time closely i took them out of the oven after minutes i was concerned they may not be fully done but they were perfect theyve stayed nice and soft definitely added this to my favorite recipes
5,these have been a favorite since i stumbled across this recipe last fall but at some point the amount of sugar needed dissapeared i used cup of granulated sugar and the cookies turned out just as they always have perfect and delicious
5,these were great i took one reviewers advice and used cup of sugar and they came out wonderful i had to bump up my time a bit but i think its because i made them a bit too big lol
5,this is perfect the only thing i changed it double the ginger and used all spice insted of cloves ourfriends kept saying this is a perfect taste to make a gingerbread house with aoh and we rolled them in colored sugar insted of white sugar and he kids went crazy for them
5,very good made cookies but they are not large i would call them average to small
5,excellent followed instructions exactly and made finished size not all that big but perfect size i have one of those old cushionaire cookie sheets think that is what they are called that always makes perfect cookies every time never burnt
5,these are perfect followed the recipe i wouldnt change a thing
5,i seriously think these cookies are just about the best ive ever tasted i made them for my pregnant daughterinlaw because of the ginger but loved them so much i intend to make another batch today by the way i followed the recipe exactly didnt change or add anything perfect
5,stars i have made over a dozen star recipes but this one was perfect i used what i had in the kitchen vegan butter and flax eggs it was still delicious i also ran out of sugar and rolled the cookie balls into powered sugar can someone say cracked out our pleasure sensors went nuts after a bite
5,in nature light creates the color in the picture color creates the light your recipes are just awesome keep up the good work
5,excellent recipe definitely will be making these cookies again
5,this is the third time ive made this recipe i make it just like instructed and its perfect better than coffee shop cookies i tend to refridgerate cookie dough for mins before i bake make sure to press down on the cookies slightly so it cooks evenly
5,i work at a cafe that makes fresh pastries and desserts and when looking for recipes i settle for absolutely nothing less than the best i have a very high standard and i was skeptical but these were wonderful cookies and i admit that i ate them for dinner and then for breakfast the next day i couldnt keep my paws off of them they are not big like the recipe says but pressing down on them before baking does help a lot these will definitely be going in my lineup at the cafe
5,made these todayturned out great
5,made these and they are more of a ginger snap taste than a gingerbread but that was fine with us very easy nd batch seemed a little dry to roll but added a little more butter and it came out easier to roll definitely will make again
5,these cookies are ama zing my mother gave me this recipe years ago always a hit perfect for a cold fall day the house smells like thanksgiving
5,the recipe caught my eye at soft and ginger the reviews that read chewy easy and ginger snap flavor convinced me it would be worth the effort used the exact ingredientsamounts and a l cookie scoop lightly pressed each dough mound with a heavy flatbottom drinking glass dipped in sugar results crackled top soft chewy and ginger snap flavored perfection shared the first batch with my taste test field specialists aka family membershuge hit made a second batch altering nothing the very next day same great results cant perfect perfection this will be another family favorite added to my taste of home collection
5,what i love about these cookies is the buttery flavor i do like ginger snaps so i halved the baking soda and they turned out perfect also used granulated cane sugar on the bottom of a juice glass to flatten them just a bit before baking could not be happier with results thank you toh
5,my new favorite ginger cookies i followed the recipe as written i have made them times in the last week doubling the recipe the rd time i have given some away in a treat bag for a small thank you and a little christmas treat
5,these are sooo good its hard to resist them after baking too as the house smells wonderful i stored mine in an airtight container and they remained soft
5,great cookies a tip they are best after or days youll have to hide them though
5,ive made this recipe twice both times the directions and cook time came out perfect the second time i added tablespoons of ground ginger opposed to tsp because i really love ginger i felt that the first batch had too much of the clove flavor and not enough of the ginger i used wakaya pink fijian ginger which is a high impact ginger mainly to add a more healthy twist on this delicious recipe i did not change the amount of cloves this is now quite possibly the best tasting cookie ive ever had my wife is a big baker and she thinks that theyre possibly the best cookie shes ever had
5,my husband is a ginger snapaholic and is forever bugging me to make them just like his mom i just made a batch of these and they came out big and soft and chewy and pretty darn close to what my husband is used to cant wait until he comes home to try them
5,i tried this recipe yesterday and was quite pleased with the results soft chewy and delicious i made a couple of changes i used cup of white and cup of brown sugar i didnt have any cloves so used nutmeg instead i also added a bag of cinnamon chips i used a inch scoop rather than making the balls less mess and the cookies are uniform in size
5,these cookies are so yummy the aroma throughout the house while they are baking is wonderful
5,great flavor soft and chewy
5,soft and chewy our office staff loved them
5,these are super tasty and wonderfully softi chilled the dough for half an hour before baking and they did not spread at all i think they need a little nutmeg but otherwise they taste great
5,fantastic fresh out of the oven with milk also my house now smells delightful
5,these ar the best gingerbread cookie i didnt have any cloves so i used nutmeg and i also added a little more molasses and let them cool in the refrigerator they did not spread they came out perfect this is my go to gingerbread cookie recipe from now on
5,fantastic quick amp easy to make delicious cookies followed recipe exactly except that i used big brown demerara sugar crystals for the additional sugar to roll them in it has a nice strong flavor and it looks pretty dough was just right cookies are soft chewy delicious
5,im generally not a huge ginger cookie fan but i was looking for something new to bring to a friends house these were just amazing the ginger flavor is not at all overwhelming and the texture is exactly what i look for in a cookie chewy this is a keeper i froze half the batch and they freeze very well still have the same chewy texture i think these would be a good cookie to send to someone if you needed something that would hold up and stay fresh over the delivery time
5,now i will begin by saying i probably would have rated this a star had i not increased the spice measurements i love a robust full of deep flavour ginger cookie and each time i have tried a recipe i have tried about i have always regretted not adding more of the spices the alteration i made was tsp ginger instead of tsp tsp cloves instead of tsp and tsp cinnamon instead of tsp also as per previous reviews i used cup brown sugar instead of cup white sugar i also added in cup molasses instead of the cupthese where phenomenal nice and thick just like i was hoping for countless recipes before yielded thin weightless cookies that lacked in depth of flavour whereas these are thick hearty and chewy if you liked a fuller spiced cookie i would definitely recommend adding in the extra i also didnt miss the added sugar because they were rolled in it anyway
5,my daughter needed to bring a small batch of cookies to something she had going on at school and shed fallen in love with molasses cookies when she helped her friend bake a batch at the friends house earlier this year my mom never made molasses cookies or gingersnaps much probably because my dad didnt care for them he preferred peanut butter or chocolate chip cookies which i still make for him now that my mom has passed away so i did a search on the toh website and came up with this recipe read the reviews and added a couple of tbsp of chopped crystallized ginger to the dough but otherwise made it exactly as written the cookies turned out fabulously my daughters classmates and teachers hoovered them up and she received three requests for the recipe the cookies are soft but that coating of granulated sugar makes for a nice thin crisp glaze we will definitely be making these again
5,these cookies are so good i rolled them in raw sugar before baking they turned out so yummy soft with sparkly sugar which added a nice crunch with each bite yes yes yes i will bake these time and time again
5,as an earlier reviewer suggested i swapped white sugar for brown sugar and increased the amount of spices in a word yum just the right amount of spice without being too overpowering and i did roll mine in white sugar for that nice crackle effect i would suggest rolling them to at least balls or more a pinch more otherwise they will poof instead of flatten out bake at minutes tops i made a double batch yesterday and just finished a second double batch today these are great holiday cookies any time of year really and this will definitely be my goto recipe in the future
5,these cookies are wonderful ive used this recipe dozens of times following it exactly and i always get tons of compliments and requests for the recipe the outsides are a tiny crunchy the middle is soft and the spices are perfect i wouldnt change a thing this is my go to recipe for ginger molasses cookies i just whipped up a batch and am now going to go enjoy one or more
5,these are good i made them this year and last to give out to my neighbors for christmas my husband really enjoyed themi did have a problem though they came out puffy instead of chewy like i was hoping any idea why this would happen what did i do wrong thanks
5,this was amazing my dad is extremely picky but he loves these my only question would be if i could make them gluten free thanks amazing cookies
5,ive been making these for years always perfectly round always an askedfor recipe they are fantastic
5,perfect molasses ginger cookie my grandmother and my mother always ate their molasses cookies with peanut butter spread on topdelicious try itit really is soooo good especially on this soft and chewy cookie version
5,this recipe is excellent i added teaspoons of finely chopped crystalized ginger for extra gingery goodness this will be a family favorite
5,i live in a high altitude state and didnt know if i needed to adjust the recipe but i made as printed and they turned out so good perfect ginger cookie they have a little crunch from the sugar on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside i will be making these again
5,these are absolutely delicious perfect for the flavor of gingersnaps without the crunch i have made these several times and they are always delightful the first time i made these i worried that the dough seemed too wet but i learned to just be gentle when rolling and sugaring and they turn out beautifully i find they always need more like minutes to get to the proper doneness these are a holiday favorite in my home
5,pi followed the recipe and it turned out excellent i think i added tsp all spice the texture of the cookie is the real starsoft and chewy not cakey and still is a week later they are not too sweet which i also love and they baked so perfectly they look like i bought them the prominent flavor is the molasses to me and the next time i make them i might have a little fun experimenting with a little cocoa in the batter or some cinnamon in the rolling sugar thank you for sharing this wonderful recipep
5,this recipe is wonderful i have made this bread probably or times in the past few months my family visiting relatives and myself included have given it rave reviews even the time i had the oven temp too low and it turned out flat as a pancake they still gobbled it all up
5,omgosh this is the best banana bread recipe ever i made it for christmas and it was a big hit my husband and son are diabetics so i used splenda instead of sugar and no one knew i will definitely make this again and again
5,i just discovered this recipe and agree it is the best one i have tried i added cranraisins amp shredded coconut to my batch i will try it with whole wheat amp splenda nest time
5,this was even better than my grandmothers recipe god rest her soul it was very moist and i love the buttermilk addition i used dried buttermilk since i didnt have fresh i added the dried buttermilk to the dry ingredients and included the liquid in the eggs banana oil and vanilla step
5,this is much easier than most banana bread recipes because no mixer is needed my husband thinks its the best i ever made i made thinner loaves so it would bake more quickly and that worked very well
5,very delicious i have already shared with two other friends

5,reminds me of grandmas banana nut bread very moist and flavorful and makes the whole house smell wonderful during baking freezes well also definately a keeper
5,the very best banana bread when i make it now i reduce the amount of sugar and instead of all white flour i substitute cup white flour with cup whole wheat flour and it is even better with less calories
5,this is the bestever banana bread the only change i make is to subtract t of buttermilk and add t banana extract in its place to get a little extra banana flavor everyone loves this banana bread

5,lovely will try to have it cream looks yummy also the ingredients thanks for recipe
5,left out seasoning salt and added t celery seed and then regular salt in place of the celery salt i loved the creaminess and slight tang the sour cream gave it ive never put sour cream in coleslaw and it was so yummy very simple but yet tasty recipe
5,i shredded my own cabbage and added carrots and sweet onion i tasted the recipe before i added the mustard or celery seed and it was just the type of dressing i have been looking for to reproduce the coleslaw of one of my favorite restaurants so i omitted those ingredients very tasty
5,loved this recipe i added a small chopped red onion and celery seed as i didnt have celery salt i will reduce the sugar next time as i personally found it too sweet but the rest of my family loved it
5,this is really good as is but i did make a couple of tweaks to suit my palate the second time around now i use a package and a half of cole slaw mix i think its too wet otherwise i reduce the sugar to tbls and add tbls vinegar and a little green onion i didnt have celery salt the first time i made it so i used tsp celery seed and increased the seasoned salt to tsp it worked out well so thats what i continue to do ill certainly never buy that jarred slaw dressing again this is so simple to make and infinitely better
5,love this recipe it is sweet creamy a touch of tart and oh so good i always follow the recipe the first time and then tweak for my taste if need be i added tsp celery seed in addition to the original ingredients for the second batch i have made it numerous times since and it tastes just as good with or without the added seed it is a keeper
5,i go to this recipe all the time i will say that i add t cider vinegar to the ingredient list i keep it in a pint in refrig so i have it on hand when i want to mix up a small batch for the of us yummy
5,i made this for a cookout and im glad i doubled the recipe the only thing i did different from the original recipe was added tarragon vinegar if you have never tried it you should i loved the flavor its a bit sweet so you can definitely cut that down the sugar if you wish if doubling i would also start with a cup of heinz mayo and add more later if it needs it
5,this is my go to recipe for coleslaw i have used different vinegars in this recipe but i agree with susan tarragon is the best
5,super duper easy i used a bag of broccoli slaw and instead of ground mustard used whole mustard seed old fashioned mustard winner for sure
5,made this for a cookout my husband asked for it twice within the week after the cookout great old tyme flavor also makes a great dip for veggies and crackers i didnt have celery salt so i very finely minced a celery stalk and that was great a little extra crunch with a lot extra flavor
5,these cookies are wonderful i usually make the crisp gingersnaps but these are a great soft ginger cookie
5,these are wonderful
5,my first soft gingersnap and what a success the whole family love them

5,this is my go to recipes yummy delicious will make it again
5,absolutely a wonderful recipe that i have searched for so many years the only alteration that we prefer in the mixture is the addition of tsp fresh ground horseradish makes great even better

5,i have made this several times and it is perfect i add a little white vinegar
5,love this recipe so did most others id consider that a success and to davei dont think buying a bag of coleslaw mix constitutes a lack of originality just a plain timesaving move what you add to it makes it your recipe
5,this was amazing loved it nice and creamy definitely making this again thank you
5,just made this and put it in the fridge for supper delicious i did add the white vinegar thanks for a great recipe
5,very creamy and delicious next time i would add a little vinegar just to give it a little added zing but that is just my personal preference
5,the best creamy coleslaw that i have found it reminds me of the coleslaw we get from the famous fried chicken place
5,easy and delicious cole slaw after reading the reviews i decided to half the recipe for one ounce bag of cole slaw i also added a bit of cider vinegar perfect side dish for a summer barbecue
5,i have mode this about times now always to rave reviews it yields a very wet coleslaw so ill sometomes back off a bit on the mayo part i too have always added a tablespoon or so of vinegar
5,i usually dont use sour cream in my slaw bu this came out fantastic i shredded a third of a head of cabbage two big carrots and half an onion through the food processor outstanding ed
5,i made this recipe without the walnuts and baked it in my doughnut pani drizzled glazed on the doughnuts they were stellar
5,this is a keeper recipe all my family enjoyed it i doubled the recipe and made two loaves somehow missed the timer and thought i overbaked it but the bread was still moist and delicous
5,this really is the best banana bread ive ever made i added a teaspoon of baking spice cinnamon cloves ginger nutmeg i wont ever use another banana bread recipe again
5,great recipe the buttermilk is what caught my eye adds a great moistness have made it several times but make it into muffins freeze them in packs of two great to take to work for breakfast or midmorning snack hintfreeze too ripe bananas in their skins in a zipper freezer bag take out one or two for a recipe thaw for a few seconds in the microwave pinch off the stem end and squeeze the banana right out of the skin
5,i have to agree this is the best banana bread ever i add honey and maple syrup instead of sugar it is so good my husband never liked banana bread because he said it was always dry but not this one
5,this recipe looks awesome and judging from the reviews i think i wanna try it we usually add chocolate chips and walnuts to our batches so i hope it turns out
5,very tasty recipe we warmed up slices and had it for breakfast very good with coffee or milk
5,i get asked to make this all of the time i usually make muffins with it
5,cant make enough of these my six grandkids love them i always make three at once
5,this is the best banana bread recipe ive tried my fiance never liked banana bread but him and my son eat it all up in a day they both always ask for it
5,great banana bread moist and easy to make as suggested i reduced the sugar by c and the loaf was plenty sweet enough didnt have walnuts on hand so used pecans found it tasted even better the day after baking a keeper recipe
5,love this recipe its the best i ever hadive made it around times and shared the recipe with many
5,starsi used cup of melted butter and cup canola oil i always use melted butter in some form in my baked goodsi also only used one cup of sugara little bakers secret if you dont have ripe bananas on hand use jars of banana baby food i done this many times and no one can tell the difference in fact guests always comment on how moist the bread isi always have jars on hand
5,the best banana bread recipe ive made it is excellent the way it is but i added another banana and it made it even more moist
5,it was very good just a little to sweet i even added an extra banana but the sweetness took over it i will however make again bur reduce sugar
5,i really love creamy mayo based cole slaw this one has a great mix of sweet and sour although a bit of vinegar might add a little acid to accentuate the flavor i made it for guests and they all loved it
5,love this i add lemon juice
5,delicious i have made it with only mayo when i havent had sour cream in the refrigerator
5,yes a splash of vinegar and this turned out just right
5,creamy indeed i love the slightly sharp edge that the sour cream adds to this recipe it seems to lighten up the heaviness that mayonnaise can sometimes add to a recipe due to health issues i did not use any salt at all i used celery seed and i cut back on the sugar and to liven it up even more some cider vinegar some freshly grinded black pepper completes this tasty side dish one of our favorites during the summer i know my family is really going to enjoy this one its a keeperjanietaste of home volunteer field editor
5,super quick and easy makes cole slaw interesting and zippy i did not have any sour cream and used just mayonnaise and it was still good
5,five star when i added about tbs cider vinegar
5,made this tonight and added tablespoons cider vinegar love it my new favorite

5,yummy and so easy will make it again and again
5,scrumptious and so easy didnt change a thing except for doubling recipe
5,this is really good only change i made was celery seed instead of celery saltbecause i didnt have any i did add some more shredded carrots for color and was able to use bags of slaw added the second bag after salad sat overnight in the refrigerator and dressing had relaxed a little yummy
5,this is a wonderful tasting salad i used some of it to top pulled pork sandwiches and it makes a nice mix the only change i would make next time is to add some apple cider vinegar personal preference will make again
5,this is hands down the best coleslaw recipe ive eve made didnt change a thing except that my daughter actually liked it
5,recently moved away from nyc missing good deli salads this coleslaw recipe was just perfect rave reviews from the entire family
5,i try to watch my salt intake so instead celery salt i used celery seed other than that no changes delicious
5,in my entire life i have never been able to make coleslaw and actually have it come out good despite having tried just about every recipe on the planet i decided to give it one last ditch effort and all i can say is this to die for it has the perfect creaminess and balance of tastes for us thank you so much renee for saving me from ever having to buy supermarket coleslaw again

5,this coleslaw recipe was excellent rave reviews at dinner i had a oz bag of the shredded cabbage which is over double the recipe and decided not to double the dressing mix to cut on calories and after the slaw sat for awhile and i stirred it occasionally the cabbage shrinks and there was plenty of dressing for me i am watching my calories and did not change the dressing part hellmans is my favorite mayo i did add craisins also and it was great thank you for sharing
5,great recipe made this last night very easy amp yummy for health reasons used light mayo amp sour cream followed the recipe exactly will never buy ready made coleslaw againthank you for sharing your recipe
5,loved this dish i did shred my own cabbage and added a little onion green pepper carrot and tsp white pepper also substituted splenda for the sugar this deserves a star review next time i make this dish i will either make less dressing or add more cabbage as it is a little heavy on the sauce
5,i love this recipeafter having it sit in fridge for couple of hours i add more coleslaw too it is the best recipe i have found definitely a star recipe
5,this is a great recipe especially for the appealing stick to veg texture of dressing if thinner is preferred spruce up with either cider vinegar or buttermilk or a splash of pineapple juice its all good

5,my husband and family just love this cole slaw recipe after making it the first time we decided to add bags of cole slaw instead of just and it is even better we will be making it all summer for bbqs

5,this recipe was great i reduced sugar to cup and it was plenty sweet enough
5,im not fond of banana bread but this recipe is delicious the bread was tender neither too light nor too dense just perfect i did make a few changes butter melted cup vegetable oil in place of the cup canola oil and used cups sugar cup brown sugar packed in place of cups sugar the brown sugar gave it a nice darker color and a chewier crust which i like i used jumbo eggs and vanilla bean paste before i put it in the oven i sprinkled chopped walnuts and clear sugar crystals on top of the batter when it was done it looked beautiful and had a nice sweet crunch on top i will definitely be making this again would make great muffins
5,this banana bread is sooo good its so moist and it tastes wonderful i would definitely recommend anyone to make this and this will be my regular recipe for banana bread
5,the best banana bread i have ever tasted
5,i made this and brought it to a family reunion and my sister couldnt stop eating ita href downloadera
5,kids loved it the only thing i would do differently is bake it for less time we baked it hour and minutes and it was still a little too brown
5,this is by far the best banana bread i have had its easy to make and i usually make a lot and freeze the loaves i havent altered the recipe but like a few of the changes that some have suggested applesauce for oil and brown sugar thanks i will try this
5,my wife found this recipe in toh several years ago the name is right it really is the best ever depends on your oven on how long it needs to bake
5,this is the first time i have ever written a review on anything but when i saw this recipe come up for the taste of home recipe of the day i knew i had to write this this is the best banana bread recipe since i have found this one it is the only one i use and i dont change a thing in the ingredients it has the perfect texture sweetness and its moist and when i make the two loaves this recipe makes theyre gone in two days this is the recipe i give to my daughter and anyone else looking for a delicious banana bread recipe
5,i am surprised to see this years ago i revised a recipe and it is identical to this one except i use cup of sugar when i was working and we had pot luck lunches i was always asked to make my banana bread i have given this recipe out many times it is the best
5,this is the exact recip i have used for over years i thought i was the only person who had this as it was given to me by a lady who passed away about years agoi have always had a lot of compliments on this i have been requested to make it many times for group gatherings it makes happy to know that so many others also have the recipe i know the recipe so well that i do not even have to look at the recipe when baking it i will definitely continue to use this recipe so yes i would mmake it againthankssubmitted by kathy boltin
5,i have been making banana bread for years but this is amazing i always freeze my old bananas so i always have bananas for bread i also sometimes throw in some blueberries or cut up apples amazing
5,this is the same recipe i have used for years with one exception i use butter instead of oil i think it gives a better flavor and texture i sometimes use c sour cream in place of the buttermilk because i almost always have sour cream but sometimes dont have buttermilk both result in excellent flavor
5,i followed the directions exactly and they were awesome reminded me of my recipe for nut goodie bars or snickers bars only tastier
5,these are delicious i took them to work and they were a hit
5,i started making these at christmas three years ago they are the best and liked by all of my family that is the first candy they ask for
5,this is a wonderful recipe and everyone who tries this candy loves it its true that it tastes like a snickers bar only way better i have no trouble with the candy falling apart contrary to what some of the other reviewers have stated cutting into the chocolate with a warm sharp knife will help make the cutting easier i also add less heavy cream almost by half when melting the caramels i followed other reviewers advice on that and it did prevent the caramel from oozing between the layers also in the past ive placed the pan in my freezer to help speed up the hardening process of the different recipes this candy is especially great when made around christmas time
5,delicious these are time consuming but fun to make when you have some time you want to spend in the kitchen well worth the time always get lots of compliments
5,this is hands down one of the most delicious things ive ever made it is a little putzy but its not difficult by any means i couldnt find regular caramels so i used caramel bits and didnt have any difficulty with oozing like others have commented the only bad thing is that trying to cut the candy is like trying to cut a brick with a pair of scissors also if the candy gets too soft despite how hard it is to cut the top layer with come off so id place it back in the fridge halfway through cutting and then cut again despite the effort ill definitely be making this again
5,hi i havent tried this one yet but in reading the recipe instructions and the comments about taxing job of cutting perhaps you could lift the candy out of the pan and cut it with a large pizza cutter just a thought i will be trying this one
5,we call them glorified snickers and they are requested every holiday
5,this coleslaw was very tasty because of a low sodium diet i did not add the seasoned salt or the celery salt and it still tasted delicious thanks for the recipe
5,i dont even like most coleslaw but i love this one
5,we love this coleslawive tried other recipes but keep coming back to this one
5,the best coleslaw i ever made creamy and sweet
5,very good basic slaw dressing without an overpowering flavor of mayo or vinegar i left out the celery salt because i didnt have any
5,love them they are always a big hit among friends and family
5,so good taste like a homemade snickers bar
5,i used your filling layer and caramel layer and let it set up then i cut them into bite size pieces and dipped them in chocolate candy coating they are just like snickers minis great recipe thank you
5,havent made this yet but i know it will be something ill make again and again
5,i have been making this for years the family and friends love this treatthank you for sharing this recipe we all love this treat
5,this stuff is awesome do take the time to make it its not like eating some piece of candy from the store it tastes homemade and way better than snickers i wrap the pieces individually and box them as gifts people rave about this candy i always have reprints of the recipe handy because im constantly asked for it
5,question does one ounce jar of marshmallow cream equal cup needed for recipe
5,this candy is one of our familys favorites as others said its time consuming to make thats the only reason it doesnt get included every christmas
5,i have made this recipe for years its always a hit and one of my hubbys favorites i dont make it often enough for him i do use a little less cream in my caramel mixture so it is not as runny
5,taste just like snickers candy bar it all held together for me i put mine in freezer then took it out after about hour then cut it it cuts much smoother very cold or almost frozen
5,this is the best recipe cant put it down
5,christmas favourite
5,i made this recipe when it first came out in the taste of home magazine in about i think i may as well not show up for christmas day gathering if i dont have them i share this recipe with everyone the only change which puts it over the top for flavor is that i make home made microwave caramel instead of buying it it makes it irresistable
5,everyone loved this recipe it kind of taste like snickers its really delicious
5,every time i make this candy everyone asks me for the recipe it is a real winner
5,used marshmallow fluff instead of creme
5,i have made these caramel candies two years in a row they have been a big hit i wrap them individually and use for gift giving
5,omg this will be a new christmas treat every year it is really putzy and kind of hardto cut into nice squares but well worth it i left out the peanuts because i dont like the texture
5,very good and very tasty would make again
5,the caramel candies are great you have to try them
5,these are the bomb we left out the peanuts as our family isnt a peanut fan we had to keep it refridgerated because the carmel melted i will definitely make again
5,absolutely phenomenal way better than a snickers bar everyone who has had these always asks when will i make it again
5,this is delicious far better than any candy bar i have even eaten although the process is time consuming it is very easy
5,so delicious they dont last long a little fussy lots of steps but easy i ended up keeping them in the fridge if not they kind of ooze the nugget layer reminds me of a big hunk bar
5,very good next time ill decrease the amount of cream in the caramels like last poster they oozed
5,this is the best candy if you love snicker bars youre gonna love these
5,this is soooo yummy ive made this several times i am now asked to make it each christmas also by family amp friends who have tried it excellent recipe
5,this candy is worth every penny you spend on ingredients and every pound you gain from eating it delicious and impressive
5,these are to die for when i make them i have to freeze half the recipe if not they are all gone in days
5,ive been making these for years and is a holiday tradition my family loves them
5,my family wont even let me through the door if i dont have these in hand ive been making these for years absolutely the best
5,this was the favorite candy for my christmas candy for the whole family
5,i made the candy today i had one problem with the filling i couldnt cook it for minutes after minutes it became very gritty and i couldnt use i threw the filling out and started over and cooked for less time i did add tablespoons of honey for all layers that called for peanut butter i always use honey in all peanut butter recipes i also use a square cake pan x for the candy i like my candy thicker with smaller squares when served
5,this recipe is excellent ive been making this each year ever since i found the recipe in taste of home it is a family favorite during christmas and into new years it is well worth the time effort and money spent to make it
5,these are very good i was concerned about how long it would take them to get firm in the refrigerator but it was ready by the time i prepared the next layer
5,i made this over the weekend while doing my holiday baking everyone absolutely loves it will definately make this again and will share the recipe with family and friends
5,this candy got rave reviews everywhere i shared it i wound up having to make two batches to last throughout the holidays
5,made this for my cookie trays this year after sitting out a while the caramel melts so to fix this i just coated the pieces with chocolate and they looked like a mini candy bar tastes just like the real thing
5,this candy is outstanding a little putzy because of the layers but worth the effort
5,been using this receipe for years i agree with the others this is the best receipe i have ever used for banana bread dee nj
5,i got this recipe in your best holiday recipes magazine it is wonderful i make it exactly by your recipe with the exception of the bake time i bake it hr min i have taken it to church many times and i get rave reviews its a keeper
5,this is best ever banana bread as others the only thing i changed was that i reduced the sugar to one cup one and one half cups was actually too sweet and less sugar is better occasionally i will substitute half the white flour for wheat and it turns out just fine
5,this is very similar to the recipe i got from my mom when i left home in as someone else stated mine calls for butter rather than oil if you dont use ripe bananas it wont turn out as well the riper the better absolutely the very best ever i make a dozen loaves at christmas every year and give them to friends who say they cant wait for the holidays to roll around for another
5,i have a little hint for this recipe this recipe is similar to mt mothers but if you mash the bskking soda in with the bananas the bananas foam and make the finish product no as dense
5,these are the changes i used half all purpose flour and half whole wheat pastry flour tbsp splenda baking blend and tbsp splenda brown sugar blend egg egg whiites and tbsp liquid egg substitute tbsp oil and tbsp butter bananas added tsp cinnamon and used pecans instead of walnuts my husband is allergic to them and toasted the nuts first my husband said it was the best banana bread i had ever made in years of marriage i made recipes and baked it in mini loaf pans for minutes at convection healthy amp delicious
5,will try this recipe as is dont know how you can rate a recipe with five stars when you change the ingredients in the recipe as for oventime we all are familiar with our own ovens and baking times
5,chocolate desert and marianmany of us have allergies diabetes or other medical issues and food likes or dislikes in our families for us its very helpful if someone shares the way they adapted a recipe i sometimes look at a recipe that i think would be good but has ingredients i cant use for one or more of the reasons above i dont always feel brave enough to try and make the changes myself since i dont always know what and how much to put in to replace thingswhen more experienced cooks try out the changes i need and share them i am in their debt there are many recipes i could never have tried without their help while you may be recipe purists please try to understand the limitations some of us live with when we are trying to expand out repertoire its pretty boring to eat the same things over and over because they are the only safe recipes you have
5,this is an excellent recipe the results were great i have to agree with marian make the recipe as printed than rate it when changes are to suit an individual taste it is not rating the written recipe
5,i just happened to have some overripe bananas on my counter when this came to my inbox today lucky me i made this for my daughters and i and we were all humming mmmmmmm in unison as we sampled the still warm loaf i would certainly make this again i will also try a version as suggested by virginaca and i appreciate her input very much my hb is diabetic and her version wont spike his sugar nearly as much as this one thank you for submitting your suggestions
5,i make this all the time i do subsitute oil for butter and i sometimes put in mini chocolate chipsyummy the best bread ever
5,i had this recipe from an old friend of mine years ago and have been making it since then best ever
5,this is the best banana bread i make it all the time minus the walnuts delicious
5,best ever banana bread with a few changes cup granulated sugar and c brown sugar and i cup of sour cream insted buttermilk
5,i added some cinnimon allspice amp nutmeg and increased the bananas to excellent
5,made this this morning it smelled wonderful use crisco to grease bottom and half way up sides of pan once cool wrap in plastic wrap and let sit for several hours moist but not real dense ill make again
5,my husband and i made this recipe and loved we plan on trying ours with pecans the next time also made a mistake or two due to drinking wine while making it lol recipe was forgiving on our mistakes good luck and enjoy
5,this recipe was a hit as for the chocolate crackingnot quite sure what you all did my only problem i had was i did not have a x pan mine was x i just used of the panit was thin but still a hit no cracked chocolate i used giaradelli sp milk chocolate had that on hand plus it was cheaper than nestles at the time
5,wonderful every year the kids demand that i make this a huge hit with everyone
5,this was a fantastic recipe very simple and easy to make and i got rave reviews when i took them to our family christmas party i have requests to make these again for sure
5,my husband loves snickers so i decided to give this a try needless to say the whole family loves this even my sister in law who doesnt like chocolate was coming back for more great recipe
5,this is fabulous everyone who has eaten has raved over it it will be an annual holiday treat at our house from now on
5,this recipe is going to become a regular to make during the holidaysyummy i figured i would be creative and made it in individual paper cups this was not a good way to go while it taste just as good it took a lot of extra time save yourself the headache and simply make it in a x pan as the recipe calls for after cutting them into squares they can easily be placed in mini paper cups for easy serving so they dont stick together the nougat filling is to die for all by itself im trying to think of a new candy to make that incorporates that alone thanks for submitting this recipe all that tried it loved it
5,this was a huge hit at both parties i took them to this year easy to make although they take time because of the need to let them harden between layers had no problems with the icing cracking or the caramel running we kept them in the refrigerator or freezer until about a half an hour before serving to store i buttered the bottom of a pyrex container lightly made one layer with the candies then put parchment paper down and made another layer on top between chilling them and the parchment paper it kept them from sticking together too much
5,this took time to make but the results are amazing everyone who has tried it has loved it and i have passed the recipe on to many friends and coworkers i kept it refrigerated
5,i have made this recipe several times it is delicious and reminds me of one of my favorite candy bars a hint for those who are having problems with the chocolate topping cracking when trying to cut into squares take the pan from the refrigerator and let it sit on your counter until the chocolate warms up a little the caramel will also soften some and be easier to cut it is a winner
5,very delicious tastes just like my favorite candy bar
5,these were insanely good made a batch and took them on our summer camping trip to the lake passed the container around and it came back empty thanks for sharing this recipe
5,sooooooo rich and delicious takes a few hours to put together but is so worth it
5,i took this to a bake sale and got calls for a week work from people wanting the recipe my husband loves it also
5,although these take a few hours to make they are deliciousi just took them to my works picnic and they were gone well before the night was over
5,these are now one of my families new christmas favorites they did take a bit more time to put together but just worked on other christmas goodies while they set up for each step made them with semisweet choc chips and were delicous
5,i entered this in a recipe contest and won first place i have made this many times and also tried woth the white chips for a different taste its very good made with dark chocolate also will make this againthanks for a great and easy recipe
5,i got this recipe from you a few years ago i have to make it every year or i hear about it my grandson asked me to make it for a bake sale one year it was the first to go i dont think they would let me in to the family get together without it this or peanut butter fudge
5,i make this every year it is sooooo good best candy you will make one i cut it into squares i place each in a small candy paper cup keeps them from sticking together
5,i make this recipe a couple of times a year and constantly get requests to make it again at work they have been nicknamed nuggets of love
5,this is a recipe with many steps but the end result is incredibly worth it it is so very delicious and is a hit with everyone who has tasted it yours will be the most popular treat if you make this for get togethers
5,alot of steps alot of ingredients bottom later was a bit too soft to do in a pan again i may do it in the little candy cups
5,this has become a family favorite many steps and many ingredients yes but well worth the effort makes an impressive gift also make some yourself you wont regret it yum
5,i made this candy and it was a huge hit passed out the recipe to or so people i did cheat a little and melted the first and last layer in the microturned out great thanks for a wonderful addition to my christmas candy tray
5,i found this recepie in one of my taste of home magazine i got from my mother in law from i make it every year for christmas and they are always a hit
5,question if i leave out the chopped mushrooms should i use cans of cream of mushroom
5,i am from minnesota and i continue coming back to this recipe again and again it is perfect as written but allows you to adjust if you dont have everything on hand we often add more mushrooms and skip the chicken altogether this is the best recipe
5,skipped the canned soup and wine and added heavy cream instead
5,this is one of our family favorites my son always reminds wursts it when he comes home for a visit
5,i make a version of this soup often in the instant pot and its consistently requested by family and now friends instead of a cream soup i use a combination of evaporated and whole milk combined with corn starch for thickening otherwise the ingredients are the same and its delicious
5,i grew up eating my moms wild rice soup but when i wanted to try it for myself i couldnt get the recipe right away so i tried this one instead it was an instant hit with my family and everyone raves about how good it was for a few days after im going to make it this time using leftover turkey from thanksgiving and my mouth is watering just thinking about it thank you so much for sharing
5,this was my first time making wild rice it was simple we truly enjoyed this soup and the depth of flavor the wild rice gives the next time i make this i will increase the amount of white wine for increased flavor didnt use the canned soup instead i used evaporated milk with cornstarch added to avoid the other reviewers complaints of runny soup i reduced the chicken broth to quarts i only added c of wild rice because the oz package only yielded that much the soup was a perfect consistency
5,this is my favorite soup im not a fan of mushrooms so i leave them out and use cream of chicken with herbs or cream of celery i purée the soup with the cup of broth or wine i also add a half cup of toasted blanched almond slivers a little extra chicken and rice make a thicker soup i use a wild rice blend everyone loves this soup
5,i made this last night for dinner i did not put any mushrooms in it because my daughter doesnt like them she doesnt have any objections to cream of mushroom soup but i used cream of chicken with herbs because it sounded good the soup was very filling more so than i expected it was also very tasty because it made so much i may get some mushrooms today and saute them to add to the soup and have again tonight it will depend on how much i find in the fridge if i make this again it will be for more than people
5,i made this exactly as the recipe says and it was soooooooooooo good we absolutely loved the soup a definite on the make again list outstanding recipe thank you so much for sharing
5,i made this soup per the directions with the exception that i did not have cream of mushroom soup so i used cream of chicken it was very good and i will definitely add it to go to list of recipes thank you
5,re chocolate caramel candyi love this recipe jane i have made it many times but i was wondering if this candy can be frozen ruthiebear
5,hi jane i love your chocolate caramel candy i have made it many times but i was wondering if this recipe can be made a head of time and then freeze it until needed thank you ruthiebear
5,i took this to work where this was greatly enjoyed i keep getting requests for the recipe
5,delicious reviews are spot on i skipped mushrooms and substituted cream of chicken soup and added spinach instead of celery
5,very good soup
5,followed the recipe to a t excellent added to my recipe file one of the best ive tried great fall amp winter soup thanks for sharing
5,this soup is wonderful i chopped the carrots instead of grating them otherwise followed recipe exactly i know it says you can skip the wine but do yourself a favor and dont it adds such an amazing flavor
5,this soup is awesome hot hearty and delicious perfect for a cold winter night i cooked up some chicken thighs and used quickmake wild rice to make the process a little faster i doubled the spices garlic powder thyme and parsley since a teaspoon of each didnt seem like much and used wine id recommend using it instead of extra broth also added a dollop of sour cream when i served it made it even more creamy and yummy really tasty highly recommend
5,loved this soup definitely a keeper i followed it to a t but did not use wine was skeptical of the thyme as it had a different flavor and have not cooked with it before put it in slow cooker all afternoon and the thyme was a nice flavor at tsp thank you for sharing
5,we love this recipe great for cold winter days
5,this soup is awesome i cook for a large family so increased a couple of the ingredients i saute the onion celery carrots and mushrooms in a little butter and add meat from a whole roasted chicken chopped also increased the mushrooms and added cans of cream of mushroom soup this is a winner
5,loved this soup i also chopped carrots instead of grating them
5,pretty tasty followed the recipe exactly except i added a little more chicken broth and some instant white rice along with the wild rice i used instant for both and added the last minutes chopped the carrots instead of grating them because we love carrots and wanted to really taste them oh and i did add a little chicken bouillon seasoning powder those changes were minimal the recipe stands on its own
5,this is a wonderful soup i highly recommend it i made an easy chicken stock from a rotisserie chicken and then followed the rest of the instructions didnt have the wine so i skipped it this turned out delicious
5,great recipe and added to favorites i left out wine and substituted canned chicken tasted delicious
5,i substituted cream of chicken because i bought the wrong thing and skipped the wine the other ingredients came from a leftover veggie platter and a chicken and rice dinner it was delicious
5,i made this during corona virus shut down so i made adjustments to what i had i used cream of bacon soup instead of the cream of mushroom as i couldnt find any at the store and i was out i halved the recipe and didnt have the dried parsley but i did everything else pretty much as the recipe called for i used canned wild rice because i always have that on hand it was delicious my husband loved it and told me hed be glad to have that again so it will go into my soup collection but i think ill stick with the cream of bacon soup because we really liked the subtle depth it gave the soup
5,made a couple of improvisions and it was awesome i did cut rice quantity in half and think actually cup would be sufficient didnt have celery but had celery salt so i used the bottom heart of romaine lettuce and doused it with celery salt preferred chopped carrots so chopped carrots instead i didnt use wine in the recipe but used additional broth
5,i made this tonight using gluten free cream of mushroom soup gluten free allpurpose flour and mini portabello mushrooms this is a very good restaurant quality soup thank you for sharing
5,i had never made this soup but being a minnesotan i figured id give it a try i was blown away at how easy it was to make not to mention how tasty it was swapped the fresh white mushrooms with baby bellas then boom the flavor is so earthy you just cant stop eating it and with it being lowcal i will definitely be making this instead of getting it from panera
5,my neighbor made this today and brought me a bowlabsolutely gourmet bowl of heaven she is a great cook and this was wonderful cant even imagine i could duplicate
5,this soup was just as good as the one i always get from a local restaurant i did make a few changes such as omitting the mushrooms and using cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom i also used a box of ricearoni long grain and wild rice with the seasoning packet so because of that i left out the spices since we are not a big spice family anyway this soup was just as good a couple of days later when we had the leftovers i will certainly be making it again as the cold weather months get here
5,really enjoyed this soup made near east long grain and wild rice ahead of time and chilled it did all the prep work ahead of time added some frozen peas and it was a cinch to put together i did use cream of chicken soup as someone else suggested yielded a nice quantity will certainly make this again
5,this is an excellent recipe for the whole family i often just use a box of wild rice side dish mix if i dont have separate wild rice we have it frequently and my granddaughter loves it
5,this soup is amazing my son tried it and said this tastes like something you would make at christmas the wine adds a delicious flavor well worth the effort
5,i made a double batch of this soup and so happy i did because i have a freezer full of delicious lunches i hadnt made wild rice before and didnt realize how long it takes to cook but well worth iti will definitely make this again
5,i love chicken wild rice soup and this recipe is so delicious it is comforting and filling it does take a little while to make but so worth it
5,i love chicken and rice soup and the wild rice in this recipe puts it over the top i also cooked the rice the day before as it takes longer than regular rice
5,this was so delicious it is absolutely comfort food i used rotisserie chicken and packages pre made uncle bens wild rice which comes in airtight bags on the rice aisle to speed up process turned out fabulous whole family loved it this recipe is a keeper
5,this soup was delicious i made it exactly as the recipe i made it for my husbands office workers they said it was better than any soup they have ever had at any restaurant its definitely a recipe i will be making again
5,this was really good very good and easy to make
5,this soup was really good i added some finely shredded swiss cheese for a little zing my family loved it
5,i too am originally from minnesota amp this soup hit the spot nothing takes me home quite like a bowl of this soup
5,so good added course ground pepper extra veggies and extra rice used white wine at the end instead of the extra chicken broth option which added extra flavor i served it with garlic butter biscuits which were used to sop up any extra broth yum
5,really good flavor dont skip the wine if you can help it it really adds was cautious with the broth as others said it was a little too much i made the soup with one quart broth and at the end when i stirred in the wine and canned soup i added one more cup broth think that is just the right consistency pretty quick to throw together as well will make again
5,i began making this after i saw it a few years ago and really like it because of illness in the family i had to do a few substitutions to get so much sodium out of it but there are easy ways to do that nownosalt added broths nosalt added cr of mushroom soup etc what i like best about this soup is something a few people know me fori dont like to waste food i always put leftover rice in the freezer and when i have enough i make this soup the same with leftover chicken of late ive been adding a cup or two of chopped broccoli good
5,i really like this soup amp it is so easy to make it is really great on a cold winter day or night
5,this recipe is very good amp it freezes well
5,this is my third time making this soup amp it is excellent im surprised that some of the reviewers stated the soup is too thin i use the full quarts of broth amp with the cups of cooked wild rice it is plenty thick make sure you dont skip the melted butter and flour mixture because that also will give the soup a thicker heartier creamier consistency i do that part differently than what the recipe says i use a small saucepan to melt the butter then i add the flour and cup broth i actually use water and bring it to a boil till its thick amp pasty then i add it to the soup mixture works great i also add teaspoon of salt to the soup and that is a personal preference
5,the flavor was great i did add some garlic to the celeryonion carrot mixture my husband loved it and he is not a fan of rice
5,i really really really loved this soup i took it to a wednesday evening church dinner and was asked for the recipe by five different people i did leave out the wine and the extra chicken broth otherwise followed the recipe to a tee
5,i made this soup exactly as listed except i did as another reviewer said and mixed the flour broth and wine together and then stirred into the butter i also substituted a wild ricequinoa blend as that was what i had in the house it is very delicious made enough for two meals for the two of us
5,this soup is very tasty my only problem is that the cooked wild rice didnt yield three cups i followed the package directions exactly but maybe i did something wrong i had never cooked it until using it in this recipe i ended up cooking some minute long grain and wild rice without the seasoning packet to add to it and that made it yummy other than that its a delicious hearty and low fat soup ill be making this one again
5,used less butter and reduced sodium broth soup and bouillon cooked the wild rice in a good rice cooker for perfect consistency will definitely make again stars
5,this was a very flavorful soup i followed both the recipe and some of the other reviewers comments mix the flour broth and wine together and then stir into the butter next time i will use the soup as a sauce for chicken breast minus the carrots the cubed cooked chicken and wild rice on the side as its consistency smoothness and delicate flavor could easily make this a great sauce for a main dish
5,made this soup today and it is delicious it has lots of flavor and a nice consistency it is not a thick creamy soup but is full of veggies chicken and rice i did make the flour and butter into a rue cooked for minutes then added chicken broth cooked another minutes then i added the canned soup to this mixture to heat in order to ensure no flour taste and got a real nice cream texture to add to the soup the only change i made was to use cream of chicken soup but mushroom would be equally nice this recipe is time consuming so do the prep work ahead as virginia suggested or just be prepared that it will definitely take longer than minutes to prepare will definitely be making again thanks virginia
5,excellent recipe i made it with some modifications based upon personal preference and what was on hand at the time quart chicken broth cups ho plus tsp better than bouillon no mushrooms cup celery shredded carrots cup onions tsp garlic pepper mix t canola butter no wine can of cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom soup and used corn starch as a thickener versus flour my husband had never had wild rice before and absolutely loved it
5,super good excellent comfort food
5,yummy
5,we just made it for the first time tonight excellent we followed the recipe except used cream of chicken instead of mushroom and the chicken broth sub for white wine loved it
5,great soup for a winter weather
5,this was very easy to make and tastes great will definitely make this again
5,this is my favorite soup recipe of all time when i make it im happy to eat it two meals a day for a week i dont like to share it its mineall mine hearty filling and low calorie what more could you want i give it stars and two thumbs up
5,i have made this and everyone that taste this love it
5,this soup is awesome using some of the chicken broth from boiling the chicken worked perfectly too its hearty and tastes wonderful
5,great taste made as noted very hearty soupplenty of chicken i just boiled two boneless skinless chicken breasts will continue to make this soup which consistently gets rave reviews
5,this makes agreat meal starter or with a chunck of crusty bread a meal one of the best soups ive ever tasted and if you will notice there is no added salt just do not need it even with low sodium broth
5,love this soup but i add frozen chopped spinach to it as my family likes more vegies
5,my family enjoyed it
5,loved this soup planning on making it again tonight
5,awesome soup going to be a staple recipe in my home
5,this is delicious could add more chicken if you like a lot of meat but i seriously dont even think the chicken is necessary
5,this soup is outstanding i will make it over and over againmy husband says it is one of the best soups he has eaten i used one box of uncle bens white and wild rice original recipe for the rice in this recipe the only thing i did different was add stick of butter at the end and i simmered the chicken along with the vegetablesit was wonderful and i cant wait to make it for company
5,very delicious soup i made it straight from the recipe no changes and none were needed
5,so good
5,this soup is amazing great flavor the prep took a lot longer than minutes but sooo worth it used a bit more chicken and rice a royal blend rice
5,this soup is gravy good awesome
5,the family loved it only thing i did differently was to throw the rice in with the first nine ingredients instead of precooking it
5,this time around i had to add more dried herbs to punch up flavor also added fresh chives amp parsley no rave reviews from our fellowship i didnt use the cream of mushroom soup cuz of the msg
5,i followed some of the other reviewers notes and didnt add the cream of mushroom soup i also added the butter flour mixture right into the soup to thicken i then added a cup or so of milk half amp half i also left out the wine it is very good i didnt measure the mushrooms just added all from a small package i used the broth i made when cooking the chicken i was very pleased with this and will definitely make again i think it would also be good as just a brothy soup adding no milkcream etc
5,i discovered this recipe a while back i had been looking for a really good chicken and rice soup and hadnt been happy with any i had found until this one it is chockfill of flavor and a real family pleaser i didnt use the wild rice but used a wild ricewhite rice and herb box mix that was perfect for this absolutely a top restaurant quality soup yet quick and easymy kind of recipe toni gommy of
5,this is so good
5,i made this exactly as called for by the recipe and it was excellent passed the test even with my granddaughter who doesnt like much of anything
5,followed recipe and soup turned out great takes some prep time but well worth it minutes i dont think so anyway this is now going to be a regular at our house
5,why say this is a terrific soup when you changed the whole recipe
5,this is a keeper we had it last night and oh it was sooo good
5,i made this for a girls night out celebration with my close friends i served with a pan of homemade cornbread all of my guests asked for the recipe
5,this is wonderful it takes some time to put together but well worth it
5,made this for christmas eve dinner family thought it was delish takes a little time to make but is super tasty a keeper
5,how many cups of wild rice per cups of cooked wild rice i am guessing
5,i used chunkier carrots cause we prefer them that way but the soup was wonderful perfect christmas eve dinner
5,yummy when i added poultry seasoning amp fresh rosemary but put in too much so fished some out
5,one of the best soups i have ever made hearty and delicious takes some prep time but well worth it i made it exactly like the recipe no changes
5,awesome soup family loved it
5,it s very good my brothers like it very much
5,wow this is one of the best soups recipes i have ever made my daughter was so disappointed when it was gone that i ran out and bought more ingredients to make more i did modify slightly the second time around qts of chicken broth pound of mushrooms and added some half and half at the end the half and half really made it much creamier so so good
5,family and friends loved itl nice hearty soup for cold days
5,i did not have wild rice but used a box of uncle bens wild rice mix and it worked great
5,this is an outstanding recipefamily thoroughly enjoyed it and have passed it on to friends
5,wonderful recipe that i will use from now on modifications i didnt use the canned soup but used cups of half amp half at the end i couldnt find wild rice so had to use a blended mix used chopped carrots instead of shredded marvelous family loved it
5,nice texture you can substitute all purpose flour with pilsbury banana nut quick bread
5,this is the recipe that i as well have been making for years i have used bananas with great results i also have switched sour cream for the buttermilk great taste i did not read all the reviews but most of them one thing i didnt see was anyone mentioning using this recipe and making mini muffins with it just make sure the nut if using as finely chopped bake for about to minutescheckingyum
5,hey this is my recipe found it in a cooking magazine back in the s an absolute favorite with no substitutions
5,i would probably bake in two smaller pans as i thought it got a litte crusty on the outside in order to get the middle done
5,this really is the best ever banana bread i have ever made i had to substitute the buttermilk and by accident i used baking powder instead of baking soda but it still turned out wonderful cant wait to make this again with the correct ingredients
5,so simple to make amp really delicious im already thinking of making it again
5,made this bread exactly as it says did not change any ingredients or measurements but instead of using a x in loaf pan i divided the batter into smaller pans as i find the middle cooks beter this bread has amazing flavor next time i will add some milk chocolate chips
5,great taste texture and sooo easy to make this will become a staple at our house
5,made two batches one with cup of sugar and one with cups both were excellentbaked for min will make again
5,loved it so moist and flavorfuli also used bananasvery good
5,made these into muffins used very ripe bananas and just a little more walnuts we like walnuts cut back on the sugar to cup wonderful flavor and very moist my husband really likes these better then my old recipe this is a keeper will be making these again
5,i made this into muffins as it is hard for the two of us to get through a whole loaf of banana bread we freeze some for later on very sweet and like the idea of adding some cho chips i also freeze whole banans if i can not get to baking right away they work well after defrosting them
5,wonderful flavor i served it to my houseguests and they loved it took the recipe home with them
5,pthis soup was amazing i dont like mushrooms so i omitted them i cooked the chicken and then used that broth to make the soup it was super delicious i am currently on weight watchers points plus and this is only points per serving gonna make some to freeze for individual servings laterp
5,this was so easy and delicious i used a rotisserie chicken so i had less prep the cream of mushroom adds just enough to make the broth thicker and almost creamy but still light it is the perfect soup for a winter day
5,i modified this recipe and left out the mushrooms because i dont care for them i didnt have celery so i added extra carrots it turned out so yummy and flavorful we ate it with a side of garlic toast its a very filling soup
5,this soup is wonderful its exactly what i was looking for the only thing i did different was i added half and half it made it a little more creamy
5,i didnt have cream of mushroom soup on hand so i used cream of chicken either would be delicious im sure
5,never any leftover when i make it everybody loves it
5,great soup recipe just the right amount of creaminess i halved the recipe and used only cups of chicken broth the original would have called for cups i did not have mushrooms on hand so i had to leave them out as well as the chicken bouillon because i never use that i loved the seasonings involved in this recipe very yummy i also left out the soup and just started the soup out with the original white sauce amounts called for in the recipe to compensate for no soup i used cup butter cup flour cup milk some chicken broth and a splash of vinegar instead of precooking my rice i just added in cup uncooked rice in the soup and cooked it until done to add some more substance i threw in about cup or so uncooked egg noodles very yummy and great topped with parmesan cheese quick and easy and a nice change from traditional chicken noodle soup will make again
5,really nice flavor my prep and cook time might have take a bit longer
5,the only thing i did different was double the spices and add poultry seasoning it was so tasty absolutely will make again
5,delicious i added a little extra mushroom because my family loves mushrooms tastes great as a left over as well will definitely make again perfect for cool weather
5,we had this in a restaurant in mn on vacation and it was amazing i make it nearly the same way as this recipe but i use smoked chicken broth for extra yum after smoking a chicken i boil up the carcass to make the broth
5,i dont like store bought soups so i made a white sauce to compensate for the cream of mushroom amp added extra mushrooms yummy
5,this soup is sooooo good it is one of my all time favorites very much a comfort food this recipe is a keeper i like to keep some in the freezer at all times
5,this is a brain dead easy meal to make and as noted below freezes very well serve with a cesar salad yes yes you want the anchovies and garlicbutterbalsamic vinegar broiled french bread and you have good eats
5,i made this cake for st paddys day and everyone loved it it was moist and so good
5,ive made this for st patricks day a few different times and it always turns out moist and big hit with everyone
5,so delicious the guinness gives this cake a rich chocolate flavor that we all loved the cream cheese frosting was so good i saved the leftover for serving on other desserts
5,amazing flavor rich and delicious made it for christmas and everyone loved it
5,i made this cake for my birthday celebration last week and wow it was a huge hit everyone raved about it it was moist rich and oh so yummy after reading reviews for the frosting i mixed a couple teaspoons of the cream with the cream cheese and sugar whipped the remaining cream then folded the two together perfection thanks again toh for another fabulous recipe
5,i made these as cupcakes and they are very good and moist i took the recommendation and cut the baking soda to tsp cupcakes took about minutes to cook the icing is more of a challenge i made it as directed and it was thin and soupy and just didnt seem right i read another comment that said they mixed the heavy cream alone until it was stiff and folded it into the mixed cream cheese and powdered sugar i would highly recommend using this method i also added about a tablespoon of baileys into the cream cheese and powdered sugar and it tasted great i would recommend this recipe
5,i dont bake often but this is recipe is a keeper i baked this cake for my nieces st birthday and the cake is delicious and the topping is fantastic everyone loved the cake easy to make and came out exactly like the picture will definitely make again one thing the frosting was runny so i placed it in the freezer for about minuteswhile the cake baked once the cake cooled off i added the frosting it was delish
5,i have made this many times with mixed results the flavor is excellent i only used dutch processed cocoa but sometimes it collapses in the middle and sometimes it doesnt so i now make it in a bundt pan and its successful whip the cream before making the frosting but i usually just make a cream cheese frosting and whip it up well i often add a heaping tablespoon of espresso powder to the cake batter as well i love this cake dense smooth and rich tasting
5,delicious a saint pattys day favorite followed the recipe exactly except added tsp vanilla to the icing
5,pi made this and it is mmmgood next time i will make it without the white wine and just use the chicken broth the wine made it tangy and took away from the flavors of chicken and earthy tone from the mushroomsp
5,this is one of the best wild rice soups to make it enhances the flavor of the rice and doesnt get all mushy this is also wonderful with ham with ham and chicken or with smoked turkey
5,this was great it had a delicious chocolate taste that was really enhanced by the beer i made it for a st patricks day dinner and everyone loved it to whiskeydrinkingcowgirl a cake falls when the ingredients have not been mixed properly i would make sure all the ingredients are well mixed
5,one of the best if not the best chocolate cake i have ever had had a dinner party for and everyone loved it served the leftovers at a tailgate the next day everyone loved it there as well
5,this is a delicious cake and easy to make too ive made it twice for coworkers and it was thoroughly enjoyed both times i was afraid there might be a strong beer flavor but the beer only serves to deepen the chocolate flavor the frosting is delicious as well wonderful cake for the person whose cake fell i think you may need to bake it longer try another to minutes
5,cake is easy and delicious i made it in a bundt pan and it came out great
5,had this cake for st pats day and it was so moist and the chocolate flavor was great will be making this again and not just for st pats big hit
5,very good moist and rich i replace half the cocoa powder with dark cocoa power i didnt use this frosting recipe
5,delicious my husband amp kids both agree
5,recipe was a complete success i followed the it almost exactly i substituted allpurposeflour for cake flour and i find doing personal sized cakes is much better took about minutes for mini cakes in the oven i also made my own cream cheese icingthey were very moist and surprisingly delicious much sweeter than i was expecting which is fine because i love sweetnext time i may make a ganache
5,my guests loved the cake easy to make and came out exactly like the picture will definitely make again
5,this is indeed a wonderful banana bread recipe my sister who hates bananas even had to admit that it was good i did however read lots of reviews before making and i used only cup of sugar brown amp gran sugar and because i did not have buttermilk i substituted with sour cream as suggested and likewise with the walnuts i only had pecans the st time i tried the recipe i used an cup pyrex dish as i saw that it made a really big loaf i started to moniter the baking process at approx hr and tested center with a toothpick this time i doubled the recipe making the same adjustments as before except i used only bananas only had that many and baked in a x i also put a thin coat of cream cheese frosting it was crispy around the edges which made it taste even better moist cake textured bread definitely a keeper
5,excellent and easy to make truly best ever substituted walnuts with choco chips
5,i did make this bread twice already and i didmake some adaptations to suit my tastesthank you for sharing this recipeits greatits also quick dawn e lowenstein
5,i baked the bread at o f instead of o f i also baked the bread in two x loaf pans and used bananas instead of i baked this bread for to minutes i was very pleased with the results as id stated in my previous ratingi did make recipe adaptationsi used cup each chopped dried apricots and candied fruit i just used cup chopped walnuts my second time around i omittedthe walnuts and added cup semisweet chocolate chips cup allpurpose flour so the fruit wouldnt sink to bottom of the loaf i prepared this bread again amp i used cup candied fruit amp cup raisin bran crunch cereal instead of the nuts and chocolate chips this recipe is definitely a keeperthank you gert kaiser for sharing this recipe delowenstein

5,made this without nuts for my grandsons excellent cant wait to make it with the walnuts this is delicious
5,my mother made wonderful banana bread but when i tried this recipe it really was the best ever banana bread ive ever tasted
5,i hadnt thought about making banana bread before but i have a large quantity of walnuts sent to me from my grandpa who hand picked and shelled buckets of them i was excited to try this recipe based on the many awesome reviews amp boy were they spot on i did chop the nuts pretty small as i dont really care for giant nuts in bread next time though ill make an exception and leave them a bit bigger by request of my dad who loves the walnuts and appreciates my grandpas hard work i did leave three muffins without nuts just to see the difference and enjoyed them both ways i followed a few suggestions from other bakers i only put in a cup of sugar regular and brown i put in three bananas and i added cinnamon a lot because its my favorite and i thought they came out great i made regular size muffins and would love to figure out how to make a topping for them maybe granola or something else to add a crunch or caramelized texture im open to suggestions
5,seriously the best banana bread ive ever made or had recipe asis is wonderful ive added cup of reeses peanut butter chips to the batter and it is absolutely crazy good i also divide mine into smaller pans and adjust cooking time and temperatures
5,the best banana bread ever i cut the sugar down to cup and add an extra banana plus chocolate chips
5,excellent bread i have tried many many recipes over the yearsmy family loves bananas needless to say this is truly the bestmade it in miniloaf pansof course had to adjust time due to small size of pans and added another banana it was delicious and easy

5,havent made i yet
5,this is a great recipe i make it as muffins and add raisins and often call it breakfast thanks
5,very good recipe would definitely make this again like other reviewers i only added cup of sugar and it was plenty also used bananas instead of be sure to check for doneness before the amount of time called for mine only baked for hour and minutes ovens really vary
5,this is the best chocolate cake i have ever had wonderfully moist amp not too sweet it gets more most after a day or
5,with all the terrific reviews i probably dont need to convince you to try this recipe after making it once i have been asked to make this over and over i dont mind doing so since this cake is so easy and always a hit if you have some homebrewed stout this is a great use for it
5,omg i dont consider myself an experienced baker and am often intimidated by cake recipes though i have tackled a few i am also an instant gratification baker and involved complicated chemistry like bake goods scare me to death i just finished this cake easy perfect and beautiful everyone loved itreally raved about itthink i will do another next week for saint patricks day novice bakers take note this cake will wow them
5,this cake is moist and delicious great for st patricks day
5,this cake turned out moist and really tasty the guinness adds a subtlety to the flavor of the chocolate that makes it really shine
5,made this into cupcakes so it was less time consuming for a cooking class in my cooking school everyone loved them
5,i never review recipes although toh has so many this cake is awesome agree with recent reviewer use a large saucepan as you add a lot of ingredients to it will make this every st patricks day
5,ive made this for the last two st patricks days and it is great i do the frosting a bit differently i whip the cream separately i also whip the cream cheese and sugar separately and then fold them in together i add a bit of baileys irish cream to the frosting too delish
5,delicious ending to a fantastic st pattys day dinner of guiness corned beef and cabbage used a in round cake pan and came out perfectly also didnt use the cream used light cream cheese and added vanilla to the frosting yum
5,omg this is a great cake i dont bake much but decided this looked easy and i had the guinness anyway boy am i glad that i saw this recipe hubby asked if we could just make this enough that we have it to eat every day all the time lol i dont have a spring form pan so i made it in a x and it turned out great
5,this cake is awesome i also listened to the advice some gave and whipped most of the whipping cream to make the frosting fluffier and not so runny it seems to make way too much for the cake though so i dip plain cookies in the leftover frosting
5,what more needs be said this cake was incredible
5,one of the best cakes i have ever made and maybe the easiest recipes to follow except the part about using a small saucepan medium works better to handle all of the ingredients i wouldnt change a thing about this recipe it comes out great every time and everyone loves it
5,i am not a cake lover but made this for company and it is but to die for nice and moist
5,this is a cake for special occasions i have made it for birthdays st patricks day and parties not only great reviews but requests for doggie bags to take some home
5,i made the recipe as directed the cake is moist as said in other reviews i used a bundt pan for baking my husband thought this cake was devine i love the fact this is an easy yummy cake
5,omg this cake is awesome key to getting the frosting right is to make sure the whipping is really cold recommend putting in the freezer for about mins before you use it i will totally make this again enjoy
5,oopsi meant to say whipping cream in my previous post

5,one of the best cakes ive ever made
5,loved this this was one heck of a moist dense chocolate cake thanks
5,easy to make interesting ingredients and directions for the cake and frosting the cake is dense and moist with a slight bitter quality from the beer it is not overly sweet and the frosting is perfect
5,we served it to company and it was a hit we in the kitchen got to lick the serving utensils that is all that was left of it
5,ive made this twice and both times it was excellent i noticed some comments on the icing being a bit runny i didnt have heavy whipping cream so i used half and half creamer and i just added a few tables spoons at a time until i got the right consistency it was probably about of a cup more or less the half and half worked great and i got the right consistency with less than the recipe calls for
5,made this got great reviews cant even taste the beer it is so moist
5,cake was so good and stayed moist for days easy and quick recipe frosting tasted a little dull on its own not sweet but was perfect once on top of the cake hubby loved this and will be made again in our house
5,since making this cake last year for st patricks day it has become my signature cake people love it its easy and always turns out well ive taken to mixing baileys in the frosting instead of cup whipping cream i do a of each im making it again tomorrow for my moms boss birthday sans baileys since it will be enjoyed at school
5,i love this i could eat the entire cake myself luckily nobody will let me because they loved it too make this
5,for the frosting i would suggest whipping the cream first doing so until stiff peaks appear remove to a chilled bowl and set in the fridge proceed with cream cheese and confectioners sugar then fold in chilled whipped cream for flavor add a touch of baileys i also wonder how this would work if you omitted the cream cheese and confectioners sugar and just whipped the heavy ceam then added the baileys might be interesting
5,love this cake oh my goodness i have made it quite a few times and every time i do i am asked for the recipe
5,excellent my husband hates chocolate cake but loves this cake it is best when made the day before serving and kept in the fridge so the flavors can blend the first time i made it we served it still a little warm and you couldnt taste the guinness but the next day when my husband and i had another slice it was so much better because the flavors had blended
5,i have made this or times and every time it has turned out fabulous not sure why some people have had such bad luck making it it is the best cake i have ever made
5,a very nice chocolate cake the beer doesnt loom large in the overall flavor i used cup sour cream instead of cup which may have made it a bit more moist
5,the cake s very moist topping is a little runny and you dont need as much as recipe makes but very good
5,this is amazing and dont worry if you dont like guinness or dark beers like that the beer adds a great flavor to the cake without being overpowering
5,i have had so many requests its moist the frosting is not too sweet everyone raves about it
5,omg this is the best chocolate cake ive had since my moms black midnight cake which was much harder to make excellent
5,best

5,best chocolate cake ive ever had
5,i made it into dozen cupcakes the batter makes the perfect amount for dozen and there is plenty of frosting very nice guinness undertone with the chocolate yum
5,i think that white icing is waaayy too sugary sweet if youre looking for something more decadantmake a chocolate ganache oz semisweet chocolate chips amp cup heavy cream simmer both together amp melt the chips pour it over the completely cooled cake amazing serve it with some sliced fresh strawberriesfriends will beg you for the recipe
5,make a chocolate ganache to drizzle over the top by oz semisweet chips melted amp cup heavy cream melted on the stovethe cake recipe is beyond words the best cake ive ever had so dense amp just a hint of guiness my husband has already asked for this to be his birthday cakein july
5,yum thats all i need to sayto the folks needing an alternate to the beer the beer is what makes this cake so moiste and flavorful sorry
5,this is basically the old texas sheet cake baked in a bundt pan instead of the cookie sheet and it can be made using cola like coke or pepsi or dr pepper it can also be make using water i know the beer will give the cake a malty flavor but the water or soda will work too
5,i served this to a group of friends and they all said it was to die for and wanted the recipe

5,i made this for st patricks day and everyone loved it very moist and it was even better the next day after it had been refridgerated

5,absolutely loved this cake as did the people i served it to i did make a few lowfat adjustments used lowfat sour cream lowfat cream cheese and light butter the frosting was awesome on this cake this is a keeper
5,i can not use the beer is there anything i can use instead
5,this was very good i love beans this was easy and flavorful
5,very tasty recipe thank you for sharing it can be easily modified with a few ingredients to peoples tastes but i like it as is not sure what pam was doing to this recipe but looks like she should have just thrown it out completely and added all her silly ingredients to plain chicken stock and wrote her own recipe rather than destroying yours lol
5,great recipe very easy to make with raw chicken or leftover rotisserie chicken follow the recipe ignore pam hers is not the recipe in question
5,this is my favorite white chicken chili the only thing i do is add another can of beans that i drain and mash to give it a little more thickness i top the bowls with a little shredded sharp cheese a dollop of sour cream chopped and seeded jalapeno
5,i made this a bit healthier by using spaghetti squash instead of noodles added mushrooms to the meat mixture as well it was delicious
5,absolutely delicious i made it exactly as written my husband loves it i serve it with a dollop of plain non fat greek yogurt which almost tastes like sour cream and a little shredded cheddar on top
5,very good this is a make again recipe
5,loved the frosting i made the cake in a bundt pan and it looked beautiful moist with good albeit somewhat mild flavor easy to make and frost lots of requests for the recipe
5,i baked this last night and served it while still warm delicious my mother said she loved it more without the icing i will make this again next week absolutely delicious
5,made this for a family get together and it was a hit i took home an empty platenote that the beer should be included with the cake ingredients rather than the topping ingredients
5,moist and not too sweet the frosting is truly the icing onthe cake
5,very good i also added cornstarch and water the last minutes to thicken
5,i have made this over and over i absolutely love it and follow the recipe or double its amazingly good i do use a rotisserie chicken a lot of the time either way it is delish and always a hit
5,awesome the only change i made was to add a small can of diced green chilies
5,ive been making this for quite a while now i put my chicken in a bowl and stir in the spices i let it set for about minutes so the chicken absorbs the flavors of the spices thats the only change i made its delicious
5,this is a very good recipe for white chili it is a little thin and more like soup when made exactly as written i substitute a cup of heavy whipping cream for one of the cups of chicken broth which gives it a very creamy and thicker sauce ive used chicken ive cooked myself canned chicken and rotisserie chicken at different times and all of them work well in the recipe
5,my family of four loved this dish my nine year said it tasted like a chicken burrito and gave it a ten i think i will double the recipe next time so we will have enough left over for an easy weeknight dinner
5,excellent easy to follow recipe we really enjoyed it and will definitely make it again
5,i made this last year an forgot to say how great this is i doubled it as she does an i did not see the need for the cheese which makes it low fat more of a soup texture which is fine an it has a wonderful flavor followed the recipe as i always do the first time i make it an will not make any changes easy an excellent
5,we love white chili this recipe is one of the best the favors come right through we will fix this again and again
5,i have made this recipe twice now once with nuts and once without it is by far the best banana bread ive ever had shhhhhdont tell my grandma
5,the name of this recipe is spot on it is the best ever banana bread and so easy too the outside has a wonderful crunch and the inside is so rich and flavorful it is the only recipe i will use from now on
5,can you believe the people who did not give stars or even gave a review yet did not follow recipe directions people if you dont follow recipe directions and change what is supposed to be done and it didnt turn out the way it was supposed to then dont rate low not recipe fault your fault
5,if i could give it six stars i would this is definitely the best ever banana bread
5,for a delicious gooey top cover it with aluminum foil when it first comes out of the oven this is a wonderful recipe
5,truly is the best banana bread ive had perfect texture and flavor only change was to substitute sour cream for the buttermilk
5,any suggestions would be appreciated i tried this twice today and both times it fell in the middle minutes before the cook time was up the oven thermometer holds steady at degrees i live at ft but other breads i have tried have done fine
5,really a nice recipe my family cannot have nuts so i sub in raisins instead
5,very nicedaisyh try making mini loaves that is what i do and cut the baking time down and they did not fall and they came out perfectly i really love this recipe
5,best banana bread i ever had
5,ive been making this same recipe since the s i found it in a bon appetite magazine everyone who tries it loves it
5,it was moist and good my family loved it we added a glaze that made it even betterglaze for one loaf c sugar tsp vanilla tsp melted butter c orange juice or lemon juice or grapefruit juice plus a little water mix poke holes and put on top of loaf
5,this is a great recipe for banana bread i love how its crispy on the outside and moist on the inside
5,love this recipe and have used it for years it is quite sweet and could be just as good with less sugar i cliped this recipe out of taste of home mag in issue so to deenadu maybe allrecipescom got it from taste of home dont be too quick to judge
5,has anyone substituted applesauce for part of the oil i would like to cut down on calories and fat but dont want to ruin the end result
5,i am not a chili eater but i love this recipe when i am short of time i use canned chicken and just put everything in the crockpot without cooking the chicken first when i have time i would cook the chicken beforehand i do think this gives the chili more flavor but either recipe tastes good
5,delicious and simple
5,i doubled it to fit better in my quart slow cooker great without jalapeno peppers i used a ounce container of diced peppers amp onions from the grocery store yum
5,i did not add as much broth added some white wine for extra flavor and a can of crushed tomatoes to give it that chili flavor it was great
5,love this recipe it is more of a soup than chili but who caresit is delicious my hubby loves this even the leftovers you have to try it
5,i have been making this recipe for many years i mash can of beans with some broth and add additional cans drained beans to the soup it seems to give it the right consistency for a chili i add chopped canned jalapeno depending on who i am serving kids no jalapeno i put out bowls of toppings for each person to select their own such as crushed baked tortilla chips chopped avocado chopped tomato cheddar cheese and sour cream this is the most delicious soup and my family requests it even in the summer
5,i used a can of green chilies instead of fresh jalapenos eliminated the sour cream and cheese the family loved it
5,delicious i added a bit of corn starch to thicken it a hit with my husband too thanks for sharing
5,this recipe was very good we ate it with biscuits so we didnt mind that it was a little soupy it was not as spicy as many chilies but had an excellent blend of flavors yum
5,one of my favorites i make this all the time my dad is a very picky eater and he even eats this highly recommended
5,so good i also added another can of beans and that helped to thicken it i also used just rotisserie chicken and added it at the end we topped the dish with a little mexican shredded cheese sour cream cilantro and hot green salsa cornbread on the side
5,loved this chicken chili i did substitute a roasted chicken for the chicken breast as i was in a hurry and it was fab doubled the recipe and ate it for a week kids husband everyone loved it great recipe
5,perfect recipe for anyone on a dairy freegluten free diet really tasty i used frozen precooked chicken the first time i made it to save on time
5,served at a realtors luncheon everyone loved it
5,this was wonderful i used my emersion blender just before serving to thicken it up yum
5,really yummy great hearty chili for winter
5,super yummy
5,this was a real winner i submitted this chili as part of a chiliccook off and beat the other entries everyone loved it
5,this is the best banana bread ive ever had i made it for my family friends and church they all rave about it last week i did an experiment substituted home made cinnamon apple sauce for the bananas came out really good the people of my church really liked it i just made a loaf didnt have any buttermilk so i melted table spoons of butter added table spoons of half and half the loaf came out just as good great reciepe
5,this banana bread deserves more than stars i use this recipe exclusively
5,i will also only be using this recipe from now on finally a banana bread that is moist and that i can taste the banana in added a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg and bananas hubby says instead of trying to eat the bananas before they get overripe as usual well purposefully leave them to brown just so we can have this bread as often as possible
5,im not even a huge fan of banana bread but this was just delicious i left out the nuts since we didnt have them in the house i will be saving this and using it as my standby for banana bread
5,fantastic i was even able to make this in a gluten free version for my fiancé who is gluten intolerant tasted amazing
5,this is my favorite banana bread recipe
5,omgthis is the best banana bread ever so very flavorful and moist as suggested i used bananas and did not have buttermilk so used whipped cream amp few dollops of butter i was contemplating adding the spices amp brown sugar suggested in the other reviews but do not want to alter such a perfect yummy recipe
5,this is the only banana bread recipe i will make from now on great
5,this recipe is fantastic ive made it many times and wouldnt change a thing except i usually use bananas
5,this is truly the best banana bread recipe ive tried and ive tried a few it is versatile and good just as it stands
5,i choose this recipe because it only needed bananas for a loaf i had available and i wanted two loafs this was such delicious banana bread i didnt have buttermilk and just used regular milk too i didnt have canola oil so i used vegetable oil this is so moist and a lovely brown loaf when baked in metal pans i loved the chewy texture to the ends of the loaf all the kids agree and want to keep eating it even my girl that doesnt like bananas loved it yeah i will definitely make it again
5,terrific i cut down to cup of white sugar and c brown sugar and next time will cut it even more however i also used melted butter because i did not have oil it was decadent
5,so moist and delicious
5,i made this yesterday and its very good very moist and flavorful i used bananas as suggested by others and it had a nice banana flavor mine took an extra minutes of baking time and thus got a little dark but that might be my old oven i think next time i will try substituting melted butter for the canola oil i prefer baking with butter
5,thanks domsmom for your suggestions i used butter in place of oil and used part brown sugar part white sugar and it truly is the best ever banana bread i omitted the walnuts too my husband never liked banana bread until i made this also i always had trouble with my bread baking all the way thru wo becoming to done not anymore d
5,we make this recipe frequently its a classic and guests always love it for a little more flavor i leave the seeds in the jalepeno i usually always double the recipe to feed six adults we prefer the cannellini beans because theyre larger and softer we love to serve it with cheese sour cream and tortilla chips
5,sooo good i will for sure be doubling next time it was very flavorful and it satisfied my guests perfect for a cold day
5,it turned out really goodi may have added to much broth but still really good
5,this has become one of my go to recipes for cool weather its delicious tastes just as good heated up and just an overall killer recipe
5,my husband loved this recipewill definately make it again
5,followed the recipe seeded the jalapeno and added pickled from the jar it was so amazing my kids even ate it this will be a new monthly dinner
5,this was the perfect crock pot chili recipe for game day i doubled it and added a can of beans it was still a little on the soupy side so i will add more chicken next time it needs more than hours to cook for the chicken and onions to get good and tender i would recommend hours in the slow cooker
5,i can see why this recipe is contest winning i followed the original posters suggestion about doubling and adding an extra can of beans and it is extremely good i have made this for guests and they always want the recipe we have this at least once a month but i could eat it every week
5,i just made this today i used a little over a pound of chicken breast cans of cannellini beans and about oz of great northern beans i added about a cup more chicken broth as well to compensate for the extra chicken i didnt have jalapenos so i added a oz can of diced jalapenos when i was cooking the chicken terrific reheated as well we topped ours with monterey jack this was a hit at our house on this cold snowy day
5,my husband works evenings so i cook on the weekend for the whole week this was so easy and sooo delicious i got to have a small bowl before he took the whole pot to work to share with his coworkers he gave me the message they want more
5,my husband and i loved this recipe i would not change anything about it and will make it many times
5,i used serrano chilis instead because that is what i had on hand
5,this is just wonderful chili probably is the best description i would describe it as a great comfort soup the flavor is awesome like youre eating a hot liquid chicken and bean burrito sounds weird but thats what it is i accidentally only bought one can of beans not remembering that the recipe called for so i threw in a can of corn to fill it up and it was so great i would do that every time
5,this was very good i reduced the chicken broth amount to a bit over a cup and used a white chicken chili boxed mix it was devoured by our fellowship
5,absolutely wonderful and so easy to make
5,my mother and i both pulled this recipe this past year and it has become a favorite we both make it with homemade bread and everyone loves it
5,ive used this recipe a number of times and it is always a crowd pleaser it is packed with protien and perfectly filling i add cup of cooked brown rice and can of mexicorn you can find it at most grocery stores its a mix of corn and red and green bell peppers i usually double the recipe because it is so popular and when i do i like to sub out one of the cans of white kidney bean left whole with a can of red kidney beans for some more color these modifications keep it healthy as well as add a little more hardiness to the dish i will always have this one in my recipe box love it
5,this one was a hit with my boyfriend and our kids everyone was asking for more i think ill double the recipe next time so we have enough to take to work for lunch
5,wow my husband told me that it is the best chili he had i am very happy
5,a family favorite my son asks over and over to make this wonderful flavor
5,yummy a very easy and healthy dish it was more soupy than i like so i pureed a cup of beans and and added it back to the chili i also used a roasted garlic broth and additional seasonings to kick it up i will be making this again very soon
5,very easy to make and tasty
5,i added more broth and threw in about cups of cooked rice it was delicious just enough zip of the pepper without being spicy
5,both my picky eaters loved it my husband loved it well make it again
5,it was devoured at our fellowship i quadrupled most of the ingredients except for the broth using only box and used cans of progresso beans and oz of cheese i served it with tortilla strips very good and mildly spicy june i didnt have cumin but put in trader joes taco seasoning chili powder amp paprika to taste cups chicken broth was too soupy put in cup instant mashed potato flakes amp cans of beans tastes okay to me no fellowship verdict yet
5,i have always loved white chicken chili but this was my first try at making it it is a small recipe that really serves large servings instead of i made the following changes to just about double it i used lbs of boneless skinless chicken breasts tsp of salt tbls pepper med onion small can mild green chilis tsps dried oregano tsps ground cumin cans white kidney beans cups of chicken broth cup shredded cheddar and cup shredded pepper jack everything else in the recipe i left the same cilantro is super important in this recipe as it pulls all the flavors together if you try it without i think its kind of bland love love love this stuff
5,this recipe was easy and very tastythe family loved itthe next tine i think i am going to add potatoes and some carrots as it is cooking
5,very good cooked in crock pot
5,this is so yummy the great thing is you can make it on the stove or in a crock pot
5,making again tonight my husband loved this and i didnt think he would
5,we loved this i used home cooked beans and put more in also used canned geen chilis we wanted enough for leftovers so doubled every thing except all the liquid delicious
5,i added extra chicken and did not do the pepper as i wasnt sure if my kids would like it i pureed can of the white beans and added a large can of kidney beans it wouldve been good to put a can of black beans too this dish has plenty of protein gluten free you can use plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream and it tastes better with raw cheddar cheese last thing i did was not put it on low for hrs rather i put my crockpot on high it made the chicken very tender
5,i made this for the first time last night and my husband told me it was definitely a keeper i enjoyed it as well having big chunks of white chicken that i could feed my two year old was great as well thanks
5,huge hit with the entire family we did cut the sugar back by cup and will probably reduce it more next time like others we also add ed some cinnamon and nutmeg to suit our familys taste
5,made this today and its been a family favorite for years
5,this stayed so moist even after it cooled for days later i followed it perfectly but left out the nuts this recipe is a keeper
5,love this recipe make it all the time really easy and tastes amazing also if you dont have butter milk just take some regular milk and vinegar it makes the same thickness and doesnt taste any different its tbls vinegar to every cup of milk and set for min while your mixing up everything else so in a cup of milk i would just put tsp vinegar
5,really good recipe didnt have canola oil use vegetable oil and it was delicious
5,wow amazing banana flavor very soft n moistcant resist eating another piece this bread is awsomedefinately a keeper used bananas as suggested by other reviewersthanks to all do make a big diff in tasteused a cup of brown sugarn added a few blueberries just at top which made the bread look really pretty didnt sink in the batter even baked in a foil loaf pan n a small pyrex dishused baking powder as i only had it at handbaking time was exact as recipe statesno added nuts cuz my kids r not a huge fan of nutswill definately be making it againthough will use cup of oil next time just to chk if it still stays moist enoughits outside was crustyn i liked it my neighbour did it tooher remarks were excellent thanks to toh thumbs up
5,great and easy
5,best ever banana bread its in the oven as we speak second time ive made it in weeks i do add a teaspoon of cinnamon and an extra banana
5,threw out all the other banana bread recipes in my collection this the best one ever for variety i added mini semisweet chocolate chips to satisfy the chocoaholic in me
5,wow super super good banana bread all other banana bread recipes are now worthless i did what some other reviews suggested and i added an extra banana mine were on the smaller side anyway and also a tsp of cinnamon to the dry mixture i also didnt have any buttermilk so i made my own substitution cup milk with tsp of lemon juice let it sit for minutes next time i may add some minichocolate chips for a real dessert
5,i am just starting to really experiment in the kitchen i think i have a burnt thumb lol i really wanted to try and make banana bread i was scared and prepared to fail but this recipe was so easymy boyfriend was very appreciative i used the suggestions of the extra banana and cinnamonsooooo yummy and moist and delicious will probably make again as soon as this loaf runs outhighly recommend this recipe to all beginners
5,i have been making this recipe for years and years originally from the taste of home magazine it is the best banana bread recipe i have ever tried and is my staple one whenever i bring this in to work everyone swarms around it be sure your bananas are very ripe and it will make the bread moist and sweet ive even tried it with some natural sugar substitutes and although the texture is a bit different it still tastes great
5,having loved bananas but about or years i find i have what i can only call an allergy to any type of raw bananas so after experimenting i know i can eat dried banana chips and banana breadcakes this recipe works for me so as i needed a super quick and easy recipe that works i found this one brilliant and though im not used to the us electric fahrenheit f measure i just converted it to centigrade c in the uk i would use a gas oven gas mark on with my version of the cake as one of my son prefers chocolate cake and hubby always likes nuts of some type in his cake i too added cinnamon amp sliced my bananas to save extra washing up dishes but then added chocolate fondant walnuts and cadburys drinking chocolate i reduced the amount of sugar to cup due to the sugar in the fondant i had no chocolate in the cupboards added a little milk approx a quarter cup and a drop more oil to keep the cake moist it turned out fine not quite as moist and squidgy as the usual banana chocolate cake youd expect but whoever tasted it say its perfectly fine result everones is happy and said basically what a yummylishious cake
5,this banana bread truly is amazing my husband and kids cant get enough of it i always double the recipe so can make two loaves i also use bananas because i love the banana flavor and i leave out the walnuts wonderful recipe
5,delicious add a bit of enchilada sauce to sour cream on top for a creamier bite my boyfriend loved it
5,i have been trying new recipes to ease the boredom of covid lockdown this recipe was an enormous hit with both my husband and me the ease of prep in an added bonus thank you kristi black for sharing your superb recipe
5,i dont usually do reviews but i made this but doubled for my big family and omg absolutely the easiest and best dish everyone loved it
5,really delicious recipe i didnt change a thing i used homemade salsa and home canned jalapenos my gosh this was on par with anything you could order at a mexican restaurant
5,made a double batch for picky step children and they loved them i used corn and flour shells the corn shells seemed much spicier but still good i served these with cilantro lime rice however plain rice was preferred by others i even subribed to taste of home after making this hoping for more success recipes
5,this is a fantastic and simple recipeeveryone always raves about it i double the pepper cause we like it spicy and serve with a bit of pepper jack cheese on topa dollap of light sour cream is divine too
5,i make this regularly my whole family loves it i have made it for company and it goes over very well regarding the weight watchers question i also was on ww and figured the point value to be pts per serving without cheese and sour cream
5,i threw all of the ingredients in the crock pot you cant get an easier and it tastes great i will use it again in regards the ww question there is nothing bad in the recipe i agree that it wouldnt be more than points per serving
5,my husband and i found this recipe to be delicious better each time it was warmed up although it didnt last that long adding the cheese and sour cream really enriches the taste i will definitely be making this again and again
5,i used chicken stock instead of brothi think it gave more richness to the recipe
5,fantastic super easy to make and very flavorful
5,this recipe has a great blend of flavors the only deviations i made were to use lb of chicken amp i omitted the salt amp instead sprinkled the meat with pepper amp greek seasoning only because my mom is watching her salt intake i too noticed my consistency was more along the lines of a soup i know ill make this one again amp think next time ill follow the recommendation of the recipe submitter amp add an extra can of beans amp maybe a lb of chicken thank you for posting the recipe its a definite keeper
5,in the last mo i have already made this recipe times so good and easy to make i love it on the cold days i have passed this recipe onto several ppl already
5,this is delicious and so easy to make i didnt use sour cream or cilantro you can also omit the cheese and it is still great
5,made this last night and my family loved it fairly easy to make i reserved the chicken broth and the remaining cooked chicken for another meal this recipe is company worthy very good use the flour tortillas
5,made exactly as written omg this was to die for id give it more stars if i could everything was delicious looked good and this was so easy to make makes a lot served with chopped lettuce sour cream tomatoes and jalapenos didnt really need the jalapenos because the salsa was a hot salsa its not often that i will find a recipe that is good for me to keep this one is a keeper
5,soo yummy made as directed with the exception of corn tortillas cause you know gluten totally a keeper
5,i used refried beans on bottom of pan then added the enchiladas this has o be the best recipe for enchiladas yummy
5,great recipe the cream cheese is so different from any enchilada recipe ive made before but it was excellent in this dish
5,this was really good but i made a few changes i bought a ounce can of enchilada sauce instead of a ounce can i used about ounces of it i added a clove of minced garlic to the salsa
5,second time i have made this the first time i followed directions this time i made a double batch if you make a double batch watch out you are going to have a lot so this time i followed directions but i also put a half of red onion small can of chopped olives about a cup of mexican cheese about a half of cup of sour cream and lastly about oz of green enchilada sauce in the pot mixed it up and cooked it for about minutes then followed directions for the rest of the recipe ended up with by and one by great and simple recipe
5,i used warmed corn tortillas for improved flavor ended up using tomatillo salsa which was what i had on hand this is a very easy and versatile recipe family loved it
5,my child ate this thank you we all loved it the cream cheese added a nice creamy touch
5,this was fantastic i doubled the cream cheese to oz and used red enchilada sauce recipe did not specify so good this will become a recipe we go to again and again heavenly
5,i searched for an easy chicken enchilada recipe and after making this one i know i found a recipe ill use over and over again im making it for the second time this week the only change i made is to use a store bought rotisserie chicken and it turned out perfectly thanks for the recipe
5,simple tasty and best of all our kids loved it
5,very simple to prep tasty
5,very easy used flour tortillas and two in square pans and worked great i fit five enchiladas in each pan perfectly and each were filled generously will make again
5,super yum im and it was easy for me to follow and make myself
5,my husband and i are relatively new to mexican cooking having traveled to nm to visit our daughter awhile back and absolutely loving the food while there since returning three years ago this dish is easily the best weve found and made yet thanks so much for the recipe kristi my only addition to this was pickled red onions and lime crema sauce oz sour cream juice of lime and tsp kosher salt as garnishes weve both decided its a keeper and definitely worth making again and again even for company ps we found that we could only use cup filling per tortilla thus easily make almost twice as many enchiladas as stated each one was still very filling though thanks again
5,delicious i made it with some turkey meat that i simmered off the bones it was very easy
5,love easy recipes for good food
5,this was a simple delicious dish makes a lot i have enough for second meal i sauted onion and i used black beans amp a lot more cheese i added cheese inside before i folded and added more on top with sliced green onion and cilantro i served with corn and salad nice meal will make again
5,this is a simple easy to make after working all day and was ready in no time very delicious thanks
5,delicious this dish is requested by my family regularly i decrease the chopped green chilies for less heat
5,incredible very easy to make and taste amazing we be making this recipe again real soon
5,very good i used corn tortillas used fresh chopped jalepeno peppers instead of canned added some chopped onion to the top of the chicken mix before rolling the tortilla served it with fresh salsa made from chopped tomatoes jalepeno onions cilantro salt and garlic powder i like the idea of the burritos but have not done it yet
5,i never review recipes but i had to on this one because it was so good i made it exactly as described with one small addition i made a microwave pouch of mexican rice and before i put the stuffing in each tortilla i put a little bit of the rice we topped them with pico de gallo and sour cream i usually dread eating leftovers but i have looked forward to these and this recipe makes a lot i actually ended up filling a x dish plus another x dish thanks for the great recipe
5,simply outstanding i searched for a banana bread made with oil rather than butter so this fit the bill no mixer needed just stir until blended and bake i reduced sugar to cups and substituted banana extract in place of vanilla the combination of oil in place of butter and lower baking temperature yielded a tall moist and flavorful loaf
5,this is great and easy to make i did add an extra banana which made it more moist but it is not needed i also used mini loaf pans and baked them minutes i have made other banana breads and this is my favorite
5,i read every review and then made my version i added tsp cinnamon and nutmeg tothe flour cup sugar bananas stk melted butter tsp banana extract baked itminutes goes without saying this is absolutely the best ever banana bread my husband loved it so much before going to bed i sliced a piece buttered it and left itfor him to toast next morning have bought more bananas to ripen for another loaf
5,the whole family loves this bread outstanding recipe
5,amazing i added cinnamon and an extra banana i am going to get mini loaf pans and then double the recipe then make it i will say how it goes
5,great recipe it is a bit sweeter than i would like since this is my husbands favorite im making it for the second time this week i did add a dash of cinnamon
5,i reduced the sugar to cup as per suggestions i reduced the oil by half and replaced it with more banana and some applesauce i also replaced almost all the flour with whole wheat flour a healthier version that still tasted great the kids loved it
5,wow this banana bread really is the best ive ever had im not a big nut eater so i changed those out for milk chocolate toffee bits my family is doing backflips just go ahead and double the recipe you will definitely want an extra loaf if just to share with another lucky family enjoy
5,this is the best banana bread i have ever made and the only recipe i will use from now on i do admit that i have made a couple of changes use melted unsalted butter instead of oil reduced the sugar to cup increased the number of bananas to three increased the buttermilk by another tbsp added some cinnamon and left out the nuts but the recipe also works well as written i prefer to bake mine in a x pan for hour and minutes delicious
5,this is the best best best banana bread i followed the recipe except i used coconut oil and i added some unused chocolate chips it did overflow in the in x in loaf pan so next time ill put some batter in muffin cups the flavor was perfect i made this last week and meant to save the recipe well i forgot so today i was searching the internet for over an hour trying to find the recipe finally i used my internet history and found it thank you for this version very tasty
5,this has become my familys goto recipe for banana bread we all love the tremendous flavor
5,we have made this many times and it is delish it is actually tastier than many enchiladas ive had in restaurants i always make a doublebatch because my busy family demands leftovers of this great meal to have handy
5,wonderful flavors and easy to make this dish will become one of our weeknight staples

5,very nice flavor i added some cooked rice to make it go further family loved it
5,made this yesterday evening for dinner and it was a hit followed recipe with the substitution of black beans for pintos as we just do not like pinto beans very tasty and incredibly easy
5,hmmm thought i had reviewed this b going to make it again probably using corn tortilla as b frying them slightly making my own enchilada sauce and not sure about which beans ill use but tried black beans last time and liked both dh amp i enjoyed this a lot
5,these enchiladas were true comfort food i made them without any changes to the recipe and they were easy delicious and appreciated by all who ate them thank you kristi for an excellent recipe
5,great tasting dish i doubled the recipe and brought two pans of these enchiladas to a block party last month and everyone enjoyed it the only change i made was i used a half cup of my garden jalapenos chopped instead of the canned chilies this recipe is a keeper
5,excellent my daughter said mom these are the best enchiladas you have ever made thank you for the recipe definitely a keeper
5,just tried it tonight and loved it like one reviewer said depending on the salsa you might not even need to add the green chili unless you like it hot i think next time i will half the cream cheese because that made it a little too rich for us this would make an easy and popular potluck dish
5,this recipe was absolutely amazing my husband is a huge mexican food fan and he was ranting and raving about it all night
5,these enchiladas are so easy to make and are absolutely delicious my husband loves these and ive now had to make them weeks in a row i follow the recipe except that i use pulled chicken from a rotisserie chicken and i use inch tortillas rather than inch my year old even likes these i serve with spanish rice and a side salad of lettuce tomato avacado and sour cream yum
5,this was easy to make and my family loved it even the picky year old i substituted black beans for pinto and queso fresco for cream cheese had on hand it was just delicious a definite repeater and company worthy
5,very easy to make great taste i used shredded rotisserie chicken and i spread refried beans on the burrito style shells rather than using pinto beans i think that chopped onion would be good in the chicken mixture as well
5,so delicious i also used a cheater chicken that i shredded and it turned out amazing this recipe is a keeper
5,the whole family loved this recipe
5,so delicious and easy will definitely make this a regular
5,very tasty filling and makes you want more
5,this is home idea flavor not restaurant but very tasty anyway

5,this was very good i used black beans instead of pinto and the johnny cake made it all a great combo
5,i didnt add the pinto beans or chilis for personal taste and they turned out great this is not one of my regular recipes
5,delicious and makes plenty yes i agree it makes great leftovers my husband has asked for me to make again
5,yummy recipe we all love i blend the salsa no onion chunks for my kids and sometimes omit the green chilis for a less spicy enchilada but its all around one of my favorites

5,makes great banana muffins as well

5,very good i make it in a x and serve as a cake its become a family favorite for birthdays
5,i made these for a party and everyone asked for the recipe i actually made them ahead of time froze them and frosted them the day of the party very moist the flavor and texture were excellent and theyre not too sweet
5,this is an excellent recipe that i will forever have on hand made this a second time an added fresh cooked apples nuts and minced dried apricots also used a cream cheese icing tip that i always use added t whipping cream after cream cheese is beaten tillis smooth this makes the softest spreadable frosting ever i shared slices with friends and everyone raves on the moist and tasty cake
5,yes this is an excellent recipe and ive already added it to my computer recipe book it is quick easy and delicious i made my cake froze it and when i was ready to use it i thawed and then iced it i shared it my my sewing group and they all loved it a few pieces of walnuts sprinkled on each piece was a great addition for those who like nuts kbbradfords review below this one has a great hintadd the t whipping cream to the frosting because it does make a wonderfully smooth and creamy frosting and it is oh so easy to spread
5,just made these banana bars for easter they were delicious i added a half banana to the icing i wasnt sure if the banana would turn the icing a weird color or texture but it turned out great next time i will add an entire banana my icing was a little sticky meaning it came off a little on the cellophane when transporting it im guessing i could have added more confectioners sugar but it just seemed like a ton of sugar regardless it was great next time i will also add the t of whipping cream as mentioned below thanks for the recipe
5,i love this recipe as a switch up for using ripe bananas the combination of the butter sour cream and banana make for a very moist dessert cream cheese frosting is the perfect topping a keeper
5,i made this recipe for church snacks today and it was a hit very easy and a nice change from banana bread for those bananas that are getting ripe the combination of bananas and sour cream make for a very moist cake i agree with the other reviews with the cream cheese frosting being the perfect topping i will make this recipe again
5,a hit with my family easy to make moist with a great banana flavor cream cheese frosting compliments it so well
5,this is by far and away my favorite chicken enchilada recipe its also one of the least fattening that ive seen my husband is always begging me to make this recipe since there is only two of us in the home we eat on this for several days you cant go wrong with this recipe its great
5,i tried this recipe the other night since i had all the ingredients on hand my family just raved about the flavor and it looked pretty toomy husband said it was absolutely delicious it was easy to prepare and will definitely make it again thanks taste of home
5,with very picky eaters in the family i am often searching for something to please everyone i thought this recipe was a long shot but everyone loved it now i get requests for it all the time i actually cook the chicken on my foreman grill and then shred it with a couple forks and it really soaks up the flavor thanks for the great recipe
5,simply scrumptious i wanted to make these for church this morning so was worried about time but they went together quickly and i love that they also bake and cool quickly i used frozen medium bananas and it was just barely over cup used the liquid too that comes with freezing bananas i used a half sheet pan i think x and it was the perfect size for bar thickness baked mine for minutes rotating pan with minutes left one rack lower than middle of oven nice medium brown on top put in the cold garage to cool quickly i had about cups of leftover cream cheese frosting id used for cookies very thick so added maybe a good half a cup of soured milk till the right consistency for a glaze spread over the mostly cooled bars cut into bars which yielded inch sized bars they were gobbled up at church and we still had some to bring home my family loved them these will be my go to banana recipe i loathe making banana bread so these are banana goodies i will make often
5,my goto for any occasion wonderful as written and they are cake like dont change a thing perfect as written
5,cake part is perfect as is for the frosting i only use the ingredients adding icing sugar and a little milk to get the right consistency freezes well too
5,i made this to bring to my monthly book group meeting and it was delicious my daughter and mom tried it before i brought it and raved i cut into bars on a plate before bringing it everyone enjoyed it
5,excellent i always cut the sugar in half and add a smidgen of stevia leaf powder in order to trim calories and fat from recipes especially from sugar filled desserts my bananas were small so i used and mashing them gave me a bit more than a cup i also use a nonegg egg replacer because of allergies to eggs some recipes dont turn out as well using egg replacer but this one turned out beautifully i also use an icing sugar made with tapioca flour due to allergies i used half the icing sugar and added about cup tapioca flour to help with the volume and did not add in any stevia there was still enough frosting to cover the bars and it was still plenty sweet some reviews mentioned that the recipe didnt make dozen but it does i cut into rows inch side by rows inch side they were the perfect size i took them to a large gathering and received many compliments on them definitely a keeper
5,delicious and easy to make i tried to reduce the amount of sugar just a little and it came out great i will definitely make this again
5,these are delicious and easy to make
5,i used butter cream icing because my kids dont like cream cheese icing so sweet is there another kind of icing i can use cake was delicious
5,delicious dessert that my family adored more than other cakes i have made but i did make a few changes and its hard to say the impact they had i used cup almond flour cup regular instead of just regular flour i used sticks of butter eggs extremely ripe bananas a splash of whole milk and oat milk instead of sour cream i added cinammon and pecan crumbles to the cake and i used brown sugar i put the cake in a bundt pan the icing was perfect with on cups confectioners sugar and extra vanilla this cake was so moist and impressive so i guess you could say that this recipe provided the foundation for where i went with it but what i got was fabulous
5,these bars are so moist i used cups of powdered and a tad of milk to give it the right consistency it needs very little icing because the bars are so good i had leftover icing
5,i have made this recipe several times and always get rave reviews from my friends they are always delicious
5,this is a great recipe and everyone really enjoyed them i did have to bake the bars an additional minutes the only change i made was reducing the vanilla extractin the frosting by tsp and adding tsp of banana extract
5,our favorite banana bar recipe i make it anytime i need to bring dessert to an event
5,this recipe is wonderful very moist huge banana taste and the best cream cheese icing ive ever made a keeper for sure as mentioned they freeze well and take no time to thaw when youre ready for dessert i put the bars in the refrigerator after i ice them so they are easier to cut with icing on them
5,this was super easy to make and the results were a delicious and moist cake i substituted greek yogurt for sour cream because it was what i had on hand i also frosted it with a maple brown butter frosting delicious
5,these were a giant hit at my house my daughters each have boyfriends and they all loved them the sour cream made them so moist i may use bananas next time and i know id love some nuts in them i did find that as delicious as they were right after frosting them they were even better the next day i think the flavors got more intense as it sat overnight only lasted till the second day

5,a coworker brought this and used whipped vanilla frosting instead it was not only a time saver but worked perfectly with the bars im going to make them for the next family gathering
5,above it says that you can freeze them to pull out for later i really like this idea but can you please help an unexperienced baker to ensure i do that correctly im pretty good at messing things up lol do you frost them before you store them in the freezer do they need to cool before placing in the freezer how do you store them in the freezer in a pan ziplock bag etc how long can they be stored in the freezer thank you for your help
5,i make there all the time its a great use up for bananas my family loves them and theyre a nice change from banana bread sometimes i add chopped walnuts to the batter or sprinkle on top of the frosting
5,i have baked these bars for several years and there are never any left for the next day my daughters and daughterinlaw and grandkids bring me very ripe bananas as a hint to make these my only recommendation would be to make one half of the frosting as it really makes a lot would give these stars if i could
5,a recipe this is hands down my two adult nieces favorite highly recommend

5,this really is the best banana bread i have made it is delicious and easy to make im getting rid of all of my old banana bread recipes thanks i tried to give this stars but it didnt happen
5,such a tastiest banana bread ever the best recipe and easy to make thanks toh
5,the best banana bread i ever hadsuper moist
5,i have tried many banana bread recipes this one is just outstanding and the banana flavor is just awesome
5,i agree this is a wonderful recipe the buttermilk makes a big difference my recipe is almost years old and uses a stick of oleo instead of oil cup of buttermilk and only cup sugar it never fails to please
5,this is the most delicious recipe for a change i will add bag of chocolate chips i always replace cup of sour cream for the buttermilk it makes the bread very moist and flavorful
5,i made this per directions and its title fits the finished product it is a keeper texture is great very moist i used black walnuts but any nut of choice or no nuts would be just as good the baking time stated is a bit long for my oven i would suggest testing before the stated baking time mine baked in an hour i always remove breads while still warm not hot allowing a bread to completely cool sometimes increases sticking cutting a piece of waxed paper the size of the pan bottom eliminates the risk of sticking although i didnt do it this time and had no problems
5,i took this bread to my church breakfast and it got rave reviews from everyone i had many requests for the recipe it is very moist and delicious
5,i used coconut oil and coconut milk and added coconut and cranberries the best bread ever
5,this is the best banana bread recipe my mom gives me ripe bananas so she can get a loaf
5,there are three people in my house and this never lasts more than two days its wonderfully moist exactly as it is i tried to use whole grain once only once and it didnt rise nearly as well and it was a little drier also i wait until the bananas are days old and mushy and cut the sugar back by cup its still just as sweet and it cuts out a few calories
5,this is for sure the best ever banana bread it disappeared in one sitting thank you for your recipe gert
5,we love this bread with or without nuts it is wonderful
5,i have been making this bread formore than years i add a few handfuls of chocolate chips it makes a star a
5,i love the recipe as is it does need to bake a bit longer than in the recipe but of is not eggy at all i really hate egg this recipe is really good but rich

5,i made this for christmas brunch along with a savory casserole and it was a huge hit i cant stop thinking about how delicious this french toast was will make it for new years day as well
5,this is one of my go to recipes for company breakfast the scratch blueberry syrup is very tasty over the creamy egg bake i use oz of cream cheese not oz as the recipe calls for and it is plenty love this recipe
5,i made this for christmas breakfast and it is the best breakfast casserole i have ever had everyone loved it it is rich but delicious and could be made with strawberries or other fruits of similar consistency
5,very tasty i used half the cream cheese and would use even less but thats just us maple syrup works fine instead of the sauce or just use a jar of whatever flavor jelly you made that didnt set instant syrup
5,my family loves this recipe just as it is written with authentic maple syrup it makes a great meal gift as well the homemade syrup is really delicious on it
5,delicious beyond words
5,in a wordyum another wordeasy
5,made this for christmas morning we really liked itmade it a few times since the last time i added chunked up breakfast sausage links to it yum
5,this delicious recipe has been a family favorite and my main go to brunch recipe ever since it first appeared in toh in i only use one package of cream cheese instead of two since we prefer it that way as a volunteer field editor for toh magazine i highly recommend it

5,i have been making this as written for holiday brunches ever since it appeared in taste of home years ago it has never failed to be the first emptied pan on the table now that my children are adults with families i have been asked to make two pans absolutely wonderful
5,fabulous why go out for breakfast when you can make this at home since i am cooking for i cut the bread portion of the recipe in half but made the full portion of the blueberry sauce perfection i used an x pan and it still needed to be baked for the same amount of time as the full recipe
5,excellent recipe i made this for a womens breakfast meeting and every woman went back for second or third helpings raving constantly almost a dozen asked for the recipe so tasty and filling and satisfying
5,this is my favorite breakfast casserole that i make it is also a favorite of anyone that tries it i have made some minor revisions i use one one ounce block of low fat cream cheese and a whole loaf of white bread minus slices it makes it more substantial i use cups of blueberries in the casserole one is not enough for an x pan i also make a double batch of the syrup but only add total cup of sugar this allows a person to really add a nice scoop of syrup if you add cups of sugar it is much too sweet i have the perfect breakfast treat thanks taste of home for providing this fabulous recipe many years ago
5,this is a wonderful recipe have served it many times to overnight guests and everyone always enjoys it the only thing i do differently is add more blueberriesyum
5,i make this every christmas day for brunch it is also my go to recipe for brunch anytime every time i serve it someone asks for the recipe
5,this recipe was absolutely wonderful i plan on serving it on christmas morning along with an overnight egg souffle dish i love to have a few delicious recipes like this to use for overnight guests or during the holidays this one is a winner
5,this is an awesome breakfast casserole we enjoy it in the summer using fresh picked blueberries i freeze blueberries and when the holidays come i have a wonderful morning treat for my family taste of home field editor
5,i have been making this recipe for years and it always receives rave reviews when we are having breakfast buffets at my office i am always asked to bring it i use reduced fat cream cheese and i double the recipe for the sauce because we usually run out
5,i have been making this recipe for years and it always receives rave reviews when we are having breakfast buffets at my office i am always asked to bring it i use reduced fat cream cheese and i double the recipe for the sauce because we usually run out we debate whether it is breakfast food or dessert
5,this is the casserole version of a great french toast recipe i have made this has been a family and extended family favorite from the first time i tried it this way my sisters family has a weekend pig roast every year and i make sunday brunch this is always on the menu and i always get requests for the recipe
5,i made this recipe twice and the nd time around i purposely made additional adjustments to it i used loaf of pepperidge farm brown sugar cinnamon bread and i purposely just used the whole loaf crusts and all the nd time around i used just package of cream cheese and the nd time around i beat the oz package of cream cheese with cup sugar minutes then i added eggs and tsp almond extract i scraped the bottom and sides of bowl and then i added cups of milk i used pint of blueberries for both the casserole and for the blueberry sauce for the sauce id added tbsp bottled lemon juice and i stirred the sugar and cornstarch together before adding the water then cooked the minutes until it came to a boil i stirred in the blueberries lowered the heat and cooked minutes or untilthe berries burst after removing from the heat i stirred in tbsp butter i think that creaming the sugar with the cream cheese makes this dish more flavorful than just cubing it id spritzed the xx baking pan with pam used a paper towel to spread the spray around and id placed the bread cubes in the prepared pan then i added the berries and poured the milkegg mixture over the bread cubes and berries i did allow the french toast to sit covered hours on the nd time around and then cut vents in the foil to allow the steam to escape i also did allow the dish to sit covered hour before baking then i baked covered minutes at o f and then uncovered the dish and baked minutes more for an added touch i sprinkled tsp cinnamonsugar over top on the nd time around i think that my nd time worked much betterthe first time i felt that i could improve this recipe using sugar is better for me than using honey or maple syrupmy first time around id used about tbsp maple syrup all together and id used cups of milk i still stuck to eggs though and the tsp almond extract the first time around i had cubed the oz package of cream cheese and topped with the remaining bread cubes and blueberriesthe sauce is great im finding that what may work for the original recipe with personfor me it helped to make these additional improvements to have a dish proudly serveddelowenstein
5,ive been making this recipe for years now any time ive served it for brunch its gone before it even has time to cool i follow the recipe as is and its pure perfection
5,made this for mothers day brunch and everyone loved it i only used one package of the cream cheese cut it into smaller cubes and that was plenty dont skip making the blueberry sauce it was very easy to make and finished the dish very nicely we actually ran out of the sauce before the french toast was gone ill probably make the sauce to use for topping pancakes and waffles too this recipes a keeper
5,i added cups of blueberries to the sauce and tbl of butter
5,here on planet earth it doesnt get much better than this the bomb
5,made for my by my aunt for brunch a few years back i reach for this recipe often
5,this was a huge hit at family gatherings and a baby shower i attended a great recipe
5,my mom made this once when i was a little girl and i remember it at christmastime every year i am thrilled to have found the recipe again

5,my whole family loved this recipe when i took it to work to share everyone wanted the recipe
5,ive made this several times and everyone loves it however for my taste i reduce the cream cheese to one oz package
5,our family loves this breakfast dish the recipe was shared with us by a friend following a christmas brunch weve since made it for family gettogethers and it is absolutely loved were now asked to bring it whenever we get together for breakfast
5,this is fabulous i use a lb loaf of day old farmers bread instead of slices this makes for a denser casserole
5,i used my houseguests as recipe raters on this and tried this out this morning they thought it was very good i had to bake it minutes longer than the recipe called for and that eliminated the mushybreadegg condition that sometimes comes with an overnight egg bake dish i used vienna bread and it was fine my revisions for next time leave the crusts on that was timeconsuming and i may layer the top of the bread with thinner slices of cream cheese rather than the cubes not everyone around my breakfast table was a big fan of cream cheese chunks i also thought that i might try using raspberries rather than blueberries to see how that goes all in all this was a very nice change from the usual french toast or egg back recipe
5,had family in town and made this the only thing i did diffident was i put the cream cheese in the food prosseser because we dont like it chunky in the recipe every one loved it
5,this is really yummy
5,this is what everyone in my family wants for their birthday breakfastbrunch guests always rave absolutely delicious
5,this is heavenly perfect for christmas morning

5,great recipe not too sweet and a great texture i cut the recipe in half for my family as i would have had enough to feed an army but amazing recipe a keeper

5,made it for a work team meeting received many recipe requests i also add cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg i didnt have time to make the syrup but took along some mrs butterworths but most people said it was so good they didnt even need syrup
5,this is the best i have taken it to family picnics and there was another one there and both were gone
5,this was absolutely delectable i made this for a group of my friends and they devoured it i used just a normal loaf of white bread and that worked just fine and the sauce is the cherry on top be prepared for it to take a little bit longer to bake then the recipe statesit almost took me an hour and for it to start to brown
5,again and again
5,this is by far the best banana bread ever i have made this for farmers market and it sold out right away each time moist flavorful and wonderful taste i will never use another recipe for banana bread
5,best banana bread made it for my office did not think that the men would notice that i left out the walnuts believe me the men sure did tell me the next time i made the bread im to add the walnuts

5,i just made this banana bread and it is delicious my honey likes a warm slice with butter on it he kept asking for a piece before it cooled off i will be making this bread over and over again
5,ive made this recipe several times and it is excellent on the rd morning after making it we had slices left and i used them to make banana nut french toast topped with powdered sugar and if you like syrup i also do this with carrot nut bread give it a try
5,i thought this was very good and even better with a tsp of cinnamon added will definitely make again
5,my year old granddaughter and i made this bread today she loves dumping in the ingredients after i measure it was easy and moist and delicious made as directed except added some cinnamon it made mini loaves and baked for minutes
5,very good cut back on the sugar to cup
5,after yrs of using the same banana bread recipe ive switched to this recipe my daughters agree with me this is the bestever banana bread except for adding a teaspoon of banana flavoring we followed the recipe exactlyit was so quick amp easy i didnt even need the mixer only a measuring cup bowl amp wisk
5,not only did i cut the sugar back to a cup i also replaced cup of the white flour with whole wheat flour and it still turned out wonderful
5,this is one of the best i cut back on the sugar to one cup i did not have buttermilk so i used milk mixed with some lemon juice i used pecans since i did not have walnuts it was easy to prepare and came out perfect after hour min will make this again soon this one did not last long
5,the best
5,i usually dont follow a recipe for clam chowder but because this was a taste of home recipe i tried it i used low sodium better than bouillon used full fat half and half because that is what i had i used yellow potatoes which basically disappear which we like i did add one more can of clams with juice it was still thick enough for us i also cooked more bacon to serve on top it was wonderful definitely a company worthy recipe
5,absolutely phenomenal as a family of four everyone loved it my year old son says its now his favorite meal and to make it often he even asked me before he went to bed to make it soon i think next time i will double it though my picky eater daughter also ate the whole bowl
5,this was delicious lots of layers with the flavors beginning withe the bacon to the potatoes to the onions to the clams perfect for a cold night raves from everyone who ate it ready for me to make again
5,i loved this chowder admittedly i made it a seafood chowder by adding clams mussels scallops and lobster and i made a double batch it was delicious
5,i made this exactly as written soooo good this soup will definitely be in the rotation often
5,oh wow two thumbs up all around i doubled the recipe and then added an extra can of clams just because thank you for this recipe
5,followed the instructions right up until the end then added an extra oz can of whole baby clams thanks susan chowder was awesome very filling with a side salad
5,double this you wont regret it i did make modifications when doubling tripled the clam juice and omitted the water then used heavy cream instead of the ff half amp half i used just a little water at the end to get the right consistency but not nearly the doubled cupsjust a cup to clean out that heavy cream in the measuring cup i only had mini potatoes so i didnt peel just cut them in quarters the skins remained on and added a color to the mix i also used better than bouillon chicken flavor which i think beats out granules any day a hit at euchre night
5,excellent recipe delicious every time i make it
5,used clam juice instead of water and added some old baydelicious this is a good base for any seafood chowder
5,this is sooo great i made it for an overnight scrapbooking crop and now my friends want me to make it again for next weekends crop yummy
5,this is so good this will be on our easter breakfast table every year from now on i did make little change in that i tossed the chunks of pkg of cream cheese in a little sugar amp cinnamon only about c sugar with t cinnamon so not much sugar but the cinnamon was an especially nice touch
5,this recipe is so easy to make and is a crowd pleaser it is great to make the night before so that the prep is so easy in the morning i buy blueberry syrup to use instead of the sauce when i am short on time
5,i love the ease of preparation of this dish especially having it ready to bake in the morning i may use only one block oz of cream cheese next time and cube it smaller so it will spread out more efficiently highly recommended
5,this recipe was absolutely delicious fall came in with a roar over the last couple of days here in washington so i was looking for a hearty clam chowder recipe ive made clam chowder many times and this recipe was close to how ive made it in the past but with a few additions like the garlic and thyme i was hesitant at first to add them but i gave it a whirl everyone raved about how good it was i had to tweak it just a little to use what i had on hand i didnt have half and half so used heavy cream and milk and used fresh thyme from the garden rather than dried thank you so much for this wonderful recipe
5,this recipe is fabulous i added shrimp and scallops that i had smoked out on the grill the day before and turned it into a seafood chowder and it was off da chain ive made it with just clams as well and it was wonderful i love bacon so i added more bacon and i served it with scallions bacon and cheese i also added bacon to the chowder too meaning i didnt just use the bacon as a garnish and that took it over the top
5,i love soups and chowders my favorite meals to cook made this exactly to spec with two minor tweaks i had cans of clams so i threw the third one in what the heck then at the end a small drizzle of truffle oil my favorite secret ingredient never overdo that just a little drizzle but the flavordepth it adds to chowders is amazing result star major raves all around
5,this was great and super easy i used one can of chopped and one can of whole clams to give a bit more body to keep the fat content down i used one cup plain and unsweetened almond milk gave friend recipients and she used whole milk and was delish
5,drained the bacon grease and sauteed the celery and onions in a little bit of butter boiled the potatoes separately in water and chicken bouillon until fork tender then used the starchy water as the cup of water in the recipe to add thickness
5,made this recipe with a couple of exceptions i used cups chicken stock instead of water and i used good sized golden potatoes this chowder was so good oh my goodness i think next time i will put a smaller onion in it was a bit sweet and i think it could only be the amount of onion used but this was my first time ever making this soup i was intimidated of it even though ive been cooking for years it was so good and we loved it i cant wait to variations of this chowder
5,i made this recipe and made some adjustments and it was delicious since i smoke my own bacon i sliced what would equal about four thick slices and chopped them before i cooked them until crisp i used two small russet potatoes and real half and half instead of topping the servings with the crumbled bacon i added it to the mixture at the same time as the clams i served it with oyster crackers and tabasco awesome it was even better the second day heated slowly over medium low heat
5,i love new england clam chowder and so does may family i have ordered it in restaurants all over the us but never made it myself until i tried this recipe this recipe was awesome it was easy to make and tasted great i followed the recipe exactly except i had one can of whole and one can of chopped clams my husband loved the bacon on top and i thought it was good either way i will definitely make this again and again yes it does have a lot of sodium and i may experiment with reducing that but this recipe is better than most of the clams chowders in restaurants close to home so this is a winner
5,i love this recipe thank you for posting it i turn mine into seafood chowder by adding cans of escargot and tiger shrimp i also use my home made bone broths either chicken or turkey as i can control the sodium levels this way i dont have to add any extra chicken bouillon if i need extra salt i add tsp of celery salt i always have reserve bacon grease so if i dont have any bacon on hand it has the flavour in the soup already it is nice to change it up once in a while i also use this recipe for loaded baked potato soup because it so much easier enjoy
5,this is very good hubby loves it however i used full fat cream sauteed the veges in bacon grease that i save and do not put bacon on top just my preference but i do love bacon i put only one medium size potato cut in small cubes i prefer less potato and more clams i have made this times since i found this recipe about months agothank you
5,tried making clam chowder for the first time with this recipe absolutely a smash hit with the family i forgot to buy clam juice but i substituted it with more chicken broth also added in some scallops to make up for the seafood taste really really happy with how it turned out
5,followed this recipe to a tee it was amazing im from cape cod thank you
5,great recipe i use full fat half and half and less than c of flour i have tried it with and without bacon crumbles instead of the chicken bouillon i use better than bouillon both chicken and the lobster type because i am using regular half and half i dont add it until the potatoes are done and heat through well so cream does not separate
5,i use yukon gold potatoes add white wine butter and use big chunks of razor clams in this recipe i also let it cook slowly for hours to let the potatoes cook down and the chowder turns a tan color every time i make a double recipe of this its usually gone that night fyi if you let the potatoes cook down you wont need flour i dont know about you but i prefer it that way instead of having a potato soup like chowder
5,gorgeous i followed the recipe and the video which was a great help as im a novice and it was really tasty i love it and will do it again thank you diolch from wales
5,made this last night which was rainy and coldwhats new in the nw very easy and yummy like others tweaked a bit cans clams twice baconcome on got to have lots put half into soup added chives and butteragain duh didnt have white pepper so used good old black a big chunk of garlic sourdough and the of us finished it off will definitely make again we know our clam chowder on the west coast thank you very much
5,i love this clam chowder definitely the best i have made and i struggle to think of a restaurant clam chowder i liked better
5,from the household food critic this tecipe is badass i have made times st time to specgorgeous nd time the food critic brought home heavy cream instead of half and half so i used c whole milk and c heavy cream mixed together and then halved rd time i had rashers of bacon and did not want to waste so i used all were excellent creamy t h i c k and satisfying best clam chowder ever
5,my family really liked this chowder it is easy to make and very versatile ive made this twice the first time i made as directed it was pretty good but i needed a little more flavor the second time i deglazed the sautéed veggies with tb white wine before adding the broth and i used chicken bone broth instead of bouillon i also added a bay leaf and tsp of old bay seasoning in addition to the other seasonings i added cup of vermouth along with the half and half the chowder was amazing
5,i followed the changes the lady with vermouth and deglazing with white wine and this is the best clam chowder ever
5,same recipe ive used for years all you tweakers need to start your own recipe blogs
5,best recipe ever i did combo of baby shrimps and crab meat thank you
5,very tasty banana bread i cut the sugar down to less than one cup i will definitely make this again
5,i have made banana bread over the years and this is the best recipe i have ever tried i need not look further this is it
5,i tried different recipesi bought bananas and totally forgot i had them so i had a bunch and figured i could freeze some of the bread this recipe is great another time i will use an extra banana and do half white sugar half brown the other recipe i tried had all brown sugar and was also wonderful but im thinking a mix of the might be just righti always try a recipe as printed before making changesso glad i did with this one
5,this is really a great recipe i know that all our ovens bake differently but if you check your bread at the one hour mark then minute intervals after that this bread wont over cook at one hour its still really wet inside but it firms up really fast after that mine was done at hour minutes and was perfect i hope that helps
5,i have used a recipe very similar to this one since mine uses stick of margarine instead of oil only cup of sugar mashed bananas not and no buttermilk or vanilla plus ive always used pecans and not walnuts but that is a matter of preference instead of bread i often make miniature muffins and we love the muffins
5,i followed the directions exactly except for adding cup of hershey cinnamon chips along with the walnuts came out amazing
5,excellent recipe i skipped the nuts because i didnt have any and it still turned out tasty next time i will make sure i have walnuts because im sure it will be even better i read the reviews and decided to use only cup of sugar and added a teaspoon of cinnamon this is now my go to banana bread recipe very fast and easy
5,i make this any time i have bananas that are really ripe its really good
5,this is the best banana bread ever it never turned out so good before i like it because its fluffy and the bananas werent as good to eat anymore but when i baked it it turned out delicious i give it stars
5,love this recipe
5,absolutely amazing i always make mini loafs to share the deliciousness thank you for sharing
5,best of all my banana bread recipes
5,next time i will try only one cup sugar i didnt have any buttermilk so added tsp of cream of tartar to the milk the only other change i made was using saffola instead of canola my grandson suggests adding chocolate chips next time as he likes them in everything really good and very moist
5,while i am not a huge fan of just plain banana bread i must say this one is good i did add cinnamon to the batter because my family loves it i didnt add any nuts because dd doesnt like them however i would add pecans if i were making this to give away husband and i prefer pecans but that is just a preference thing will definitely make again
5,great recipe but way too much sugar for our liking i made a double batch this time and used c sugar toral i always add cinnamon with a sprinkle of nutmeg i dont ever have buttermilk so i always use milk and vinegar with great results made loaf pan and mini loaves minis took about mins large took hr mins delish
5,this is my familys new favorite clam chowder recipe absolutely delicious the only change to the recipe i made is i used heavy whipping cream only because i misread the recipe this recipe is definitely a keeper thanks for sharing it
5,just made this from the sample taste it is wonderful rich and creamy i used cups of heavy cream and i cup half and half subbed basil for the thyme delish cant wait for dinner to have a whole serving
5,i made this clam chowder and i will make it again the chowder was just delicious
5,this recipe was my baby quite a few years ago it was intended as a healthy chowder we all evolve in our cooking and these days i use chickenbetter than bouillion umami good splash of fish sauce and louisiana hotsauceshelby said the chowder was bland i dont get that and im sorry but when you want more rich use full fat half n half or whip cream add more baconadd butter and to the lady who says its not new england i always thought new england meant white chowder and manhattan is red chowder it may have originated on east coast but we west coasters do some fine chowder too and thanks to those that liked the recipe from the start
5,just finished making this and its wonderful not bland at all as previous reviewers stated i also used chicken better than bouillon as the author had mentioned as well as a shake of worcestershire this is a keeper
5,so amazing this is my new clam chowder recipe i had to make a few adjustments im doing a nospend month and im just out of some things i didnt have clam juice but i had shrimp shells saved in the freezer so i boiled those for broth and used that in place of the clam juice and it worked good i made a double batch i also had less than half the onion called for but i had green onions growing in my garden and used about a cup of those in place of one of the onions i ended up adding extra can of clams first reason was because i bought a pallet of them on clearance yeah i thought it was a good move and i wanted the extra clams because i was short on that clam juice also im going to try it again lower carb by only using small potatoes and then chopped cauliflower and i might try cream cheese in place of the flour the seasonings in this are excellent
5,i was really skeptical about the fat free half and half and flour in this recipe but ive been on weight watchers and really craving new england clam chowder so i thought id give it a try it worked like a dream thickened up perfectly and tasted rich no one could tell it was lower in fat i also added celery with the onion but otherwise kept the recipe the same my family and guests thought it was great and finished every drop in the past ive added a splash of lager or pale ale to my chowder not canon i know but i like it and i may do that with this recipe in future it just adds a little depth to the flavor
5,i just made this recipe and it is absolutely deliciousthe only thing i did different is that i used regular halfandhalf however after reading the reviews i might just try it with the fat free halfandhalf to cut down on cholesterol i will definitely make this recipe again
5,absolutely delicious and really easy i doubled the clams and eliminated the thyme and it was perfect dad ate two huge bowls and said it was the best clam chowder he has ever had i will make this again
5,awesome
5,love this recipe it is quick and easy to make i add the cooked bacon back into the pot instead of using it as a topping great flavor
5,this is my third time following this recipe i think its great that there are more than one way to prepare necc karen my wife and i love this one
5,i just made this recipe today and the hubby said it was the best clam chowder he had ever eaten cant get a better review than that the only change at all that i made was just a little more garlic and a little salt and black ground pepper it was so easy to make and tasted wonderful
5,im not from new england so i cant offer that perspective but i would say that this recipe makes a very greattasting soup anyway i used regular fat half amp half and an extra can of clams i did use the extra juice from that extra can as well the soup thickened quickly and stayed that way so adding the extra liquids made it just the right consistency for us for our tastes i also added about tbsp of kosher salt will most likely fall back on this recipe again when my son requests ne clam chowder
5,my family loves this recipe i substituted basil from my garden for the thyme
5,pi have been using this recipe for about years and my whole family loves itp
5,i made a shrimp stock since i did not have clam juice used fresh clams out of the shell given to us from a friend in maine added shrimp to the chowder and i used full fat half and half other than that i followed the recipe this chowder turned out completely amazing
5,delicious very easy to follow
5,i have tried many clam chowder recipes over the years this one is by far the best and most closely resembles new england or san francisco restaurant style i did double the amount of flour to make a little thicker
5,the family loved the recipe i doctored it up a little bit by adding bottles of clam juice to go along with the small cans of clams also a cup of white wine a teaspoon of worcestershire sauce bay leaves a dash of tabasco cup of chopped carrots it was outstanding the best ive ever madethanks so much
5,didnt use thyme in mine
5,why do reviewers always feel the need to tell the story of how many changes to the recipe they made just review the original recipe if you want to describe your custom recipe get your own blog anyway great chowder stars
5,i followed the recipe with exceptions i used heavy cream instead of half and half and i added half a cup of fresh carrots if using these exceptions make sure the carrots are in small cubes so they are done at the same time as the potato cubes the heavy cream made the soup good and thick the recipe is easy to follow and in my opinion one of the best clam chowders that i have ever tasted rates as good as any clam chowder i had in bar harbor
5,i followed this recipe to the extent my ingredients would allow i didnt have half and half on hand so i used a cup of heavy whipping cream and about cup of milk as not to make it too thick still ended up with a very tasty very creamy hit the spot soup and will be making it again my only other tweaks were a pinch more garlic because i love me some garlic and black pepper it was so delicious
5,my first time making clam chowder im glad i chose this recipe it was delicious we like it a little thicker so next time ill adjust the flour and liquid accordingly but it was still very good i used chicken broth instead of water otherwise followed recipe exactlyoh also i added one carrot chopped into very small pieces
5,made clam chowder for the first timeglad it was this recipe it was excellent my husband amp i couldnt quit eating it followed the recipe exactly except i added an extra can of clams but drained them already planning when to make it again
5,this was an excellent recipe for clam chowder i did use cans of clams which i drained and added the juice to the water for cooking the potatoes and did not buy oz of just clam juice separetly i also used instead of cup flour because i did not want it too thick it was perfect for us with cup flour i wish the reviewer from new england had been more specific in why she would not make this again a negative remark with no explanation is of no help at all enlighten us please as to why you made it in the first place since you have stated it is definetly not new england clm chowder
5,was so flavorful im glad i made it i served it with garlic bread sticks
5,this is a fabulous recipe great flavor and consistency its reasonably simple to make and many of the ingredients are things i have on hand in my pantry and fridge i have substituted whole milk instead of half and half before and its still good but the half and half yields slightly better results i like to add a handful of fresh chopped parsley at the end
5,quick an easy recipe i made it for my family and did not have the potatoes and had to substitute dehydrated potatoes from a box of au gratin potatoes and i was delicious and much quicker to cook since i did not have to wait for the potatoes to soften
5,very good i doubled the potatoes and used regular fat half and half i had fresh clams so i sauted them with the onion and celery
5,very good recipe and easy to make i like how thick it was served it with cheddar bay biscuitsit was a hit
5,great clam chowder used chicken stock instead of water would not use all the juice from the cans of clam or the half and half the soup thickened nicely but was just a little thinner than i like when adding the juice and reserved half and half will be my go to clam chowder
5,first generation pnwer here i made this for my finicky family who are all from boston amp new hampshire so i was nervous making it after the reviews from the new englandah chowdah snobs believe me my family is full of them and guess what they loved it my dad has always been particular about his chowdah and he couldnt get enough im not fond of razor clams so i subbed for some fresh local butter clams i tripled the recipe to make for the whole family not too much leftover but what was leftover i froze amp it does freeze well thank you
5,made exactly as is but used only one cup and absolutely delicious
5,excellent and low cal really enjoyed it
5,this was silky and most delicious
5,delishwill be making this often this winteri did add a handful of shrimp too
5,i remember growing up in hoquiam washington and having fresh razor clams when we were allowed to dig for the season living in tennessee now it is not the same but making clam chowder is like being back home instead of using bacon in my clam chowder i use smoked jowl to saute my onions in next week i will be making this for my daughters tae kwon do masters since they are from korea i am trying my best to cook things for their taste and when i mentioned clam chowder master park licked his lips and said he cant wait i love cooking for them because so far i have not had one complaint from them about my cooking in american korean chinese and italian dishes
5,great i used fresh clams though
5,i have been using the same chowder recipe for years and decided to try this one last night i am so glad i did it was absolutely delicious i added extra garlic and carrots i also used three cans of clams i used one cup of half and half as recommended by other reviewers and the consistency of the chowder was perfect
5,i prepared this for a party of yesterday following instructions exactly with the exception of the low fat n i used regular and cut out of the recommendation it turned out to be an absolute crowd pleaser i received favorable remarks all afternoon and was asked by several to add it to my menu i doubt that ill add it to the cafes menu but i will definitely offer it on the catering there is no doubt about this recipe winning contests thank you for sharing it
5,ex
5,i dont like bouillon so i eliminated it and the water and used chicken broth delish rushed for time one day i bought my husband a pint of clam chowder from a local seafood shop he said what you make is better than this a great review from him
5,i did make some minor changes but basically this is a great recipe great for a rainy day i used fresh thyme not dried used a small dice for the potatoes i used whole fat half and half cuz i couldnt find fat free i made the roux in a separate pot using about cup of flour instead of and stirred it into the potato clam juice mixture my potatoes were soft but a little teeny bit firm at about minutes i found that i didnt really need very much thinning at the end so i used only about cup of the half and half there result was a lovely delicious thick and creamy chowder that is the best ive ever made served it with fresh baguette bread and butter hubs an i ate the whole pot and i had to make another the following day because we didnt get enough thanks for sharing the recipe
5,amazing my dad said it was like a restaurant
5,great recipe i didnt have buttermilk so i used my unsweetened coconut milk and didnt have canola oil so i used olive oil unsure of how it would turn out and everyone loved it next time i think i will do c less sugar as it is plenty sweet this is the one i will use from now on it took hr min
5,best ever
5,my go to recipe for banana bread excellent as written i have double it and used a tube cake pan for easier presentation over time i have left out the nuts and added tsp cinnamon for our household preference
5,we just love this bread
5,we love this recipe it is the only banana bread recipe i use i have a nut allergy so i never add the walnuts but sometimes i add chocolate chips sometimes i add cup cocoa and chocolate chips sometimes i add fresh blueberries sometimes i dont add anything no matter how it is made it turns out great sometimes i even make them as muffins such a great recipe
5,i made this yesterday its gone today it definitely has the right name it was absolutely the best banana bread ever the second time i made it today i changed one thing i halved the amount of nuts and added dark chocolate chips for the other half it also was exceptionally delicious the original recipe is so moist and light not oily and mushy like a lot of recipes thank you so much for another of your recipes all i have tried have become big hits with my family
5,i have been on the hunt for a good banana bread recipe my husband has hated every recipe i have made and only likes his grandmas i got his grandmas recipe and made it and guess what did it turn out like grandmas no i tried this recipe last night i used of the all mixed finished batter and put hat into a loaf pan the remainder of the mix was used for mini muffins i did this because my sister said that every banana bread recipe is actually meant for loafs this recipe did not say to divide this into two loaf pans but my sister swore by this no the bread did not need to bake the total amount of time that was asked this was due to not putting the whole batch in one pan i sincerely believe that not using the whole batch in one pan is what helped this stay nice and flavorful and slightly moist most breads come out too dry when i use the whole batch in one pan and cook for recommended time my sister was right thanks sis the bread did turn out looking a little darker although that did not change the taste of this amazing recipe i kept a eye on the bread after a half hour and did the tooth pick trick to see when my bread was done finally i have a banana bread recipe i will be excited to add to our family favs cook book
5,one of the best recipes ive tried bread was moist kids and nephews ate it all up will definitely be making this againif youre going to be making mini loaves like i did youll need to set your timer to minutes instead of hour
5,best banana bread everive been using this recipe for five years now or more but never actually submitted a review and the very first time i made it i fell in love im very picky with my banana breads true story this is always my goto recipe to give away as treats to familyfriends or to make and keep at home but it doesnt last very long ive made it exactly the way it shows in the recipe and its amazing however being the curious and advanced chefbaker that i am i changed a few ingredients to health it up a bit youre welcome to adopt my style heres what i didused cup unbleached flour and cup whole wheat ive also used gluten free flour blend and it works just as well used cup white or raw organic sugar cup brownused cup avocado oil instead of veg or canola no taste diff and so much healthiermade my own buttermilk cup milk with tablespoon vinegar stir and let sit mins discard a bit to give just over cupmix well stir in mini chocolate chips or dark chunks and poof magic an unbelievable healthy and delicious banana bread i bake at f for mins everytimebon appetite
5,this was very good i omit the nuts but it really had nice flavor i reduced the cook time by about minutes i did the toothpick test on my smaller loaf pan just in case then decided to check the larger as well they were both done
5,wonderful
5,the taste and texture of this banana bread is perfect and my family loved it my personal preference is for the top crust to not be as dark i couldnt get the bread to cook all the way through without the top getting a dark brown i made loaves and put a piece of foil over one of them and it still turned out a dark brown as i said that is my personal preference
5,this is my favorite banana bread recipe it always comes out perfect
5,my family loves this bread sometimes i replace the walnuts with pecans or mini chocolate chips but otherwise make it according to the recipe
5,absolutely outstanding will make this over and over made a few changes due to personal preference or because what i had on hand used reg hickory smoked bacon used a vadalia onion added carrots sliced used black pepper added knorr homestyle chicken concentrate and reduced chicken bouillon to tsp probably would omit bouillon all together next time used cans of snows minced clams drained and used juice in place of bottled clam juice sauted carrots with onion and celery gave a bowl to my next door neighbors and mins later they called and said this was fine dining restraunt quality
5,great quick and easy recipe i actually added a bag of thawed frozen seafood scallops shrimp and squid and only one can of clams and it was amazing
5,i made it today and it was so yummy my husband and i had to go for seconds i did change the recipe a little i used regular chicken bouillon and regular half and half and i followed the instruction the same way
5,fantastic i increased the bacon served it baked potato soup style with the option of adding green onions cheese and sour cream sooooo good
5,absolutely greateven husband and grandson loved it
5,this chowder was amazing this was my first time making new england clam chowder and this may be the only recipe i ever make i was apprehensive to make other recipes because of all the cream and butter that they often call for this recipe does not taste light at all and is still rich without all the fat i made it as an appetizer but this could easily be a main dish soup
5,made this over the cold rainy weekendabsolutely wonderfulused cans of clams and used the clam juice from the cans of clams instead of the bottledamazingly delicious thank you for this wonderful recipe
5,this soup is so comforting its very flavorful and doesnt make you feel bloated afterwards
5,absolutely amazing ill be making this for years to come
5,this was excellent the difference is using the bacon drippings to saute the celery and onion
5,great recipe creamy and yet light i followed the recipe however i added another can of clams perfect with salad and baget will make this a favorite
5,had this for a christmas gettogether with my husbands golfing buddies amp their wives everyone loved it it is definitely a keeper for my recipe book
5,i just made this and its excellent i have celiac disease so i used potato flour to thicken it up and i have no bullion cubes so used chicken stock instead
5,this recipe is a keeper i have never made clam chowder before and didnt know what to expect i even doubled the recipe my husband loved it it is a nice creamy thick soup that i will be making again
5,i make a cake similar to this with a large yellow cake mix i make it sugar free after the cake is baked i poke holes in it and pour the pineapple in natural juice with juice over the top then add the pudding sugar free
5,we make this with the jiffy yellow cake mixes weve made it many times and its always a winner
5,we use to call this banana split cake i use banana pudding in place of the vanilla in this recipe then after placing cherries in center of each serving piece i would top with a light chocolate ice topping thru a squeeze bottle these cake is always a hit
5,amazing but used fresh thyme because dried makes it taste sweet i was giving this secret from a chef friend of mine amp it made all the difference
5,this soup is amazing i made this last night and even my daughter who will not eat soup loved it i just ate some of the leftovers for lunch and it was even better than i had remembered it was so full of flavor and i felt like it was from a high quality restaurant you wont be disappointed
5,this is one of the best new england clam chowders ive ever tasted even my husband loved it and hes not all that nuts about creamed soups the only things i did differently was double the white pepper andstir the crumbled bacon right into the soup this is definitely a recipe ill use over and over again thanks
5,excellent chowder recipe very nice flavor
5,outstanding i used regular halfnhalf since thats what i had on hand so no doubt higher in fat but oh so good this is by far one of the best clam chowder recipes ive ever had will be making this often especially during the cold winter months
5,very quick and easy to make delicious taste definitely would make again only thing i did differently was to add a touch of old bay seafood seasoning
5,i make this cake all the time but i use a pineapple cake mix more pineapple flavor that way
5,everyone just loves this cake i have made it for family friends and my garden club with rave reviews a winner everytime
5,good

5,scrumptious cake i didnt put nuts
5,i make a cake like this except i use two oz cans crushed pineapple i use the juice in place of water for the cake i bake the cake then when its cooling i take an oz cream cheese soften cut into chunks amp cup milk beat it till its pretty well broke up then add vanilla or french vanilla instant puddingoz to the milk amp cream cheese amp beat till thickenedyou will have some little lumps in pudding but it doesnt matter spread this on the cooled cake then put your crushed pineapple all over the top of pudding mixture then i put oz cool whip amp top that with bakers angel flake coconut so good
5,easy to make very light and refreshing made for dinner party and everyone like iteven seconds for some would definitely make again i put shaved almonds on top and they tasted good on it
5,great easy recipe
5,made this last week for the first time it is addictive i used regular cake mix and coconut cream pudding i toasted coconut to top with walnuts and cherries looks sooo good i made one tonite using chocolate cake and vanilla pudding havent tasted that yet but will rate that as well this cake tastes as good as it looks thank you for sharing
5,awesome awesome awesome it was so easy turned out really good cant wait to make it again i changed two things i used french vanilla cake mix and half cup of silk vanilla soy creamer cause i ran out of fat free milk it came out great enjoy
5,made it as written turned out great will make again
5,made this recipe as the recipe stated and my family loved it i will make this again
5,weve made this cake four times now did it three times with pineapple and once with strawberries the only change we made was using one ounce can of crushed pineapple we used half of the can in place of water in the cake mix and the other half on top of the pudding mixture its been a huge hit at three parties with no leftovers
5,i take this cake to our weekly get together and when i dont im asked when will i bring the cake again who would think sure a rich tasting cake would be good for you
5,great cake for pot lucks never any leftovers
5,for an even more moist cake add one small can of mandarin oranges to cake mix i dont like yellow cakehowever i love this recipeits yummy
5,i make a cake very similar to this try this when the cake comes out of the oven and has cooled poke with a fork and put the crushed pineapple with juice over the cake taking care to spoon it on all over the top to spread the juices over the cake it does not get soggy at all then spread the cream cheese mix over the pineapple and top with the cool whip i like to top it with coconut for a more tropical take
5,wonderful recipe the whole family enjoyed it great for those of us watching our weight this is a very light refreshing cake
5,very good recipe and its easy to make
5,this is such a delicious cake and so easy to make
5,i have made this cake several times and it is definitely one of my favorites it has been a big hit at family gatherings i use white cake rather than yellow and omit the cherries
5,this is definitely going to be a goto recipe nobody can believe it is healthy make sure to use the small cake mix box jiffy size not the regular size
5,this cake is very moist and refreshing
5,this is a recipe we have made and enjoyed many times easy tasty lasts good in the fridge and healthy who could ask for more
5,this was a fabulous cake my year old usually asks for a pineapple upside down cake on his birthday but he said this year he may ask for this one instead i bought a regular sized cake mix and just split it in half cups of the mix i baked it cholesterol free by using egg whites and applesauce in place of oil then i followed the instructions as directed except that i used neufchatel cheese instead of fat free cream cheese because it has even fewer calories and then i omitted the walnuts because my husband doesnt like them so with even less calories i increased the serving size so there were slices instead of it was excellent even my year old ate a whole piece very light dessert not too sweet and full of flavor and texture we really liked it a lot
5,this cake was yummy awesome
5,fabulous dessert i used white cake mix with diet sprite instead of eggs amp oil and a touch of leftover pineapple juice following suggestions by other reviewers i poked the top of the cooled cake with a fork and allowed all the juice from the oz can to sink into the cake everything else went according to recipe we cant get enough of this stuff
5,i got this recipe years ago from a coworker but lost it i am so happy to find it because i could never remember how much milk or what size pudding to use the original recipe i had called for a full size strawberry cake mix my husband is diabetic so i am going to try this with pillsbury sugar free cake mix this time
5,i love this recipe it is easy to mix together and the end result tastes great i like to wrap the cooled loaf in foil and let it sit overnight prior to servingeating as this makes it much more most this banana bread is so good
5,perfect
5,it is the best recipie ever i even used old frozen runny bananas and it was delicious
5,i live at ft and didnt modify other than swapping pecans for walnuts out of preference and it turned out great for anyone else at high altitude who might be wondering only cooked it for about hr min delicious i was concerned about the top getting too dark as one commenter stated as that often happens to me with baking but it was right in the center of my oven and came out perfectly browned
5,my husband loves this banana bread i often substitute chocolate chips for the walnuts and serve it as a dessert
5,the name says it all second to none in my book delicious
5,fantastic old fashion recipe i did decrease the sugar to cup as to make it healthierand could not tell the difference just like grandmas

5,i just made this today from a previous reviewer i also cut the sugar down to cup and this is the best banana nut bread i made this is a keeper thanks for sharing
5,i loved this i had three bananas i needed to use up so i replaced the canola oil with another banana it came out so moist and delicious
5,ok ill admit i hate it when someone submits a review and is either challenging the authenticity based on the recipe name versus the ingredients used or has not even made the recipe or has made it and says but i made changes so what am i about to do lol i am going to tell you that i love this recipe although the version that i was given does not use the buttermilk walnuts or vanilla uses tsp baking soda tsp baking powder and reduces the sugar to cup all else is the same i know its not the same right i do love nuts in my banana bread and i have added them in the past the buttermilk however adds a dairy product that my wife doesnt tolerate well lactose intolerant so for those of you looking for a nondairy version i suspect you can omit the buttermilk from this recipe and still have an awesome result

5,
5,sorry i used ounces of diet soda to the oz cake mix i just measured half of a regular cake mix since i could not find a oz one you use a oz soda with a regular cake mix can you make this with a full cake mix or is it too high everyone raved about it it is one i will make over and over again
5,i have made this cake in one form or another for years and it is always a big hit with family friends and co workers
5,how does a cake with trans fats in both the cake and the frosting get a heart healthy rating

5,this not only taste good but easy to make and real pretty to serve or give as a gift to someone thanks for the recipe
5,i used to make this cake all the time until i realized that box mixes the ones ive looked at anyway have hydrogenated oils does anyone know of a cake mix that doesnt have hydrogenated oilstrans fats i stopped using cake mixes for this reason same with whipped toppings they claim no trans fats but they have hydrogenated oils which are trans fats i only use the cans of topping now
5,my mother in law has made this for years and it is always a hit you can substitute a can of cherry pie filling instead of the pineapple for variety its also quite yummy
5,ive made this cake for years but use a pineapple cake mix instead of yellow much more flavorful
5,this cake is yummy with a capital y try substituting a pineapple or coconut cake mix for the yellow cake mix there are never any left overs
5,husband does not like cream cheese what can i substitute for it
5,my absolute favorite recipe i add extra bananas if i have them and keeps it extra moist i also use powdered buttermilk to make the cup buttermilk so i always have buttermilk available in my kitchen highly recommend this recipe
5,my family loves this recipe ask for it regularly
5,i have made this several times and everyone who has eaten this says this is the best banana bread they have ever eaten if i dont have buttermilk i will use milk with about a tb of vinegar and it still has been great this is very moist and delicious
5,emily thank you for adding your comment of using bananas amp not adding the oil this is great less calories there is added value when adjustments are made to the recipe this helps to cut down on calories or use substitutes very much appreciated
5,very good recipe but on the sugar i used brown sugar and regular white sugar i also added tsp cinnamon
5,i have made this banana bread more times than i can count its the only recipe i use and as my husband is a diabetic i make it with cup of splenda it is plenty sweet and delicious besides the walnuts i sometimes add craisins
5,our family loves this recipe so much that i keep the right amount of buttermilk frozen in baggies just so i will have it on hand when our bananas get a little too ripe and i make this bread my grandson suddenly stopped eating bananas and as it turned out he was letting them get too old so we would have banana bread
5,i really wanted some banana bread but did not have a go to recipe i trust taste of home so i came here to look for one this one rocks easy recipe with basic ingredients turned out great its a keeper
5,my grandson hes and i love this recipe he loves that we have a dry bowl and a wet bowl sometimes when our bananas arent rotten enough we will pick up some organic banana baby food works great he calls it our banana buck bread we like pecans as our bucks instead of walnuts
5,this recipe is fast easy and delicious i also used less sugar and oil than specified along with extra banana and milk i also used half brown sugar instead of all white and i added some cinnamon and allspice i love the idea of putting some of the nuts on top before baking ill be sure to do that next time also i made muffins and that baking time was about min yummy
5,ive been making this recipe for years i found it in a church cookbook im now famous for this recipe among my family friends and coworkers its so moist unlike most banana bread recipes yes it comes out dark it has sort of chewy crust that everyone loves i cant say enough about this recipe its absolutely the best
5,omitted the walnuts due to allergies sprinkled turbinado sugar on top before baking it disappeared fast definitely will double the recipe next time
5,whenever i have extra bananas this is the recipe i reach for to make banana nut bread in fact i have shared it times with different friends its that good
5,this is definitely the best banana bread ive ever tasted my whole family loves it
5,just made this last night without the capers whatever that is lol for the first time loved it sooo good im making it again tonight lol
5,thank you hope for sharing this awesome recipe quick delicious and easy clean up bonus i couldnt find my dried oregano so i substituted italian dried seasonings instead it was awesome
5,been making this recipe since when i first started college and was a broke college student never used capers cuz i never knew what they were and never had them but even without those this recipe is really good its very light and airy pair it with some rice and broccoli and you got yourself a quick affordable meal also to the person saying this recipe is bland i recommend using the lemon butter mixture before you cook them and when they come out put more of the mixture on it this helps with the flavor btw if youre not a huge fan of lemons like me i would probably use alittle less lemon juice than it asks for cuz the lemon can get pretty bold compared to the other flavors this makes a great meal prep also
5,this was wonderful i have always cooked my tilapia in a skillet and decided i wanted to try baking it i searched for a good recipe and this was the first one that actually appealed to me i am so glad we tried it we will be using this recipe a lot
5,this was so good and easy to make ive even given this recipe to my aunt
5,came out delish
5,this recipe is a favorite of mine for a quick tilapia dinner i have subbed white wine for the lemon juice and its soooo good i actually prefer the wine to the lemon juice i also upped the amount of butterwinespices by this has become one of my staples for a quick easy weeknight dinner

5,i made this for my husband who is not much of a fish eater and me he had two servings and said he would definitely eat again another plus is filets can be frozen and just bake awhile longer and it didnt leave the kitchen smelling like fish
5,this was a fantastic easy recipe i usually bread and fry my tilapia this was actually easier healthier and tastier than what i am used to i could actually taste the tilapia rather than just smothering the tilapia with tarter sauce and not actually tasting the fish a great recipethank you
5,i have made this several times i add a few dashes of old bay seafood seasoning to each filet prior to the capers as well as all the seasonings according to the recipe it really turns out flavorful and great my husband and i love this recipe its a keeper
5,i tested out this recipe for the first time id omitted the capers and scaled back on the butter lemon juice garlic powder and kept the salt and paprika as is i used italian seasoning crushedabout tsp i used a smaller pan an inch square baking pan coated with nonstick cooking spray i used tbsp to tbsp sweet pickle relish in place of the capers the butter id used tbspthe lemon juice id used to tbsp and garlic powder id used tsp i baked fish for minutes this is a very tasty dish its moist too the sauce adds a nice flavor delowenstein
5,my family loved it such a quick and simple meal
5,followed as is only put capers on half to follow kids choice and sprinkled a few green onions on top crazy good
5,what can i use instead of capers
5,i used dill pickle chopped fine same measurement in place of the capers such a great recipe
5,made this as written my husband and i both thought it was great loved the capers i will be making this again soon i might add some chopped olives thanks for sharing
5,we had it for dinner and was very very good and quick to make give it a star mary
5,really enjoyed this i added some sliced olives because i had some open very tasty
5,wow hope these are the kind of recipes im always looking for its easy but doesnt skimp on flavor when my spouse was released from the hospital and needs to be on a bland diet this was great but there is nothing bland about it its just plain delicious
5,this is a fantastic recipe everything about it works wonderfully and the taste is fantastic i do not enjoy fish much at all and i especially usually dont enjoy the taste of tilapia ive tried several recipes and theyre ok but this one made the fish taste terrific i grabbed this recipe about an hour before i was to cook and was out of capers so i searched for a substitution my google search result recommened subbing with something tangy that has a bit of a bite to it there were several options i chose to substitute capers with a spicy baby dill pickle all it took was one and it worked great if you use a spicy baby dill also be sure to mince it up really fine because it spreads the flavor out evenly over the fish when its cut up tiny the only other substitution i made was using tsp fresh minced garlic cloves because i think it tastes better than garlic powder just my taste preference everyone loved this recipe and i definitely will be using it whenever we eat tilapia in the future well done toh
5,this is the best tilapia ever and quick and simple to make
5,love the flavors of this quick easy meal
5,ive made this twice and have yet to try it im a vegetarian but my husband loves it said its the tastiest fish hes ever had

5,delicious loved the lemon flavor and the simplicity of the recipe
5,excellent easy and quick i didnt use capers and i only had about ½ tablespoons of lemon juice so i substituted ½ tablespoons of juice from a jar of dill pickles it was a weird thought sure but it worked great will definitely make this again

5,i will never look for another banana bread recipe this one completely lives up to its name
5,this is my favorite banana bread recipe i think my family lets the bananas turn brown so i will make this lol the only thing i do is dust the pansi always double it and put loaf in the freezer with cinnamon amp sugar yummmmmmmy
5,this turned out wonderfully i used bananas that were black to get a great banana flavori think i may try less sugar next time perhaps cup
5,its in the oven now sure smells good baking i checked at one hour and was still gooey in center checked again in minutes as suggested by another reviewer and it was done i had lined the loaf pan with parchment paper so i cooled for minutes and lifted it out to finish cooling smells and looks delicious my whole house smells like bananas
5,a really really good recipe i dont usually tried recipes that are labeled best ever but i had the ingredients for this one the bread is moist is has the right texture and strong banana flavor a definnite winner i used a scant cup on the oil simply because i ran out and it was still very moist
5,i have a similar recipe use cup sugar cup oil and bake in smaller pans which are great as gifts or to keep in the freezer i spray the bottom of the three pans and sprinkle with oatmeal to keep from sticking bake at degrees for minutes my husband likes blueberries rather then nutsso good hard to keep them on hand
5,i have been making this bread for many years i double the recipe and do two x loaf pans i always start my timer for minutes and then start checking the bread after that for doneness it truly is the best ever banana bread
5,this is amazing i made a few adjustments based on other reviews and cant believe that everyone in my family likes it even my daughter who said eww banana bread lol she loved itmy adjustmentsi substituted of the white sugar with brown sugar used bananas and reduced oil to cup used tsp vanilla paste for the vanilla added tsp cinnamon and a tiny pinch of ginger and nutmeg it does take quite awhile to bake but be patient its totally worth it
5,i have been using this recipe for years on end whenever my bananas are ripe and it has never failed my expectations i substitute the canola oil with safflower oil only put in cup of sugar and use more banana than recommended instead of using buttermilk which i never have in my fridge i use half and half and it works perfectly finelove love love this recipe its totally worth a shot
5,i made this delicious loaf today and it is a winner i made only two minor changes i substituted sour cream for the buttermilk which i did not have and used pecans i opted to sprinkle chopped pecans over the loaf just before popping it in the oven we love this bread and i will be making it many more times i highly recommend this recipe volunteer field editor
5,this was the first thing i have ever baked from scratch and it was incredibly delicious six stars in my book
5,i made this recipe as is no changes or substitutions i found it to be moist and delicious loaded with banana flavor highly recommended
5,this is really the best recipe for banana bread i made this bread many times with the great result every time when i tested this bread i followed the recipe exactly did no substitutions and my bread turned out perfect easy to make and delicious i made this bread with substitutions too yogurt or sour cream for buttermilk raisin for nuts more spices and it has never failed my expectations i highly recommend this recipe you will not be disappointed
5,this was very good and had a great taste i think i would make it with olive oil instead of butter so it would be a healthier recipe
5,this is one of our favorite seafood recipes we really like it with the recipe for roasted potatoes and artichokes
5,great flavor i fell in love with capers because of this recipe
5,this was tasty so easy to cook with a short amount of time involved it definitely will be a staple at our house
5,easiest yet best tasting recipe using tilapia that i have ever made only thing i changed was to season the filet with the garlic powder and salt instead of mixing it with the butter and lemon it was perfect i will say that buying fresh tilapia versus previously frozen fish will make a huge difference in taste
5,this was a big hit for my family even my daughter who is a very picky eater loved it
5,wonderful melt in your mouth buttery flavor with just a hint of lemon seasoning is perfect fast to make thawed individually vacuumed wrapped tilapia in cold water for just a short time to thaw and had this on the table in no time at all
5,used it to bake swai it was awesome melts in your mouth absolutely no fishy taste will use on differenttypes of fin fish
5,i only have one picky fish eater in the family and even she loved this fast lovely taste and perfect for a light easy meal love it
5,very delicious i didnt have the paprika but it turned out just fine without it it was a little colorless which i assume was because i omitted the paprika it did need more salt but it was still tasty as is i will definitely make this again
5,we love this recipe so easy and so flavorful
5,this is very good i have made it twice very good and very easy to make cant get enough of it thank you
5,i make this over and over we love it
5,i am not a cook i rarely cook anything also i generally do not like fish i started a low calorie diet and decided to try fish again this recipe was so easy to make and the fish turned out great my fiancée and i both really enjoyed it
5,im not a huge fan of tilapia but this dish is excellent the capers compliment the lemony sauce my family loved it and i will be making it again

5,excellent recipe my husband loved it ill definitely make it again
5,easy delicious and healthy i used salmon and t pineapple juice for some of the lemon juice yum
5,i fix this recipe about once a week i use a little less lemon juice omit the oregano and use dill weed instead my family loves it
5,this is an easy and yummy recipe
5,this was delicious i didnt have tilapia so i made the recipe with sole and i doubled the recipe for my larger family i also used dill instead of oregano the sole had a lot of water in it creating so much liquid that the fish was more poached than baked when it was done i thickened all the extra liquid with a little cornstarch and drizzled it over the fish oh my goshit was so good the combination of butter lemon dill and capers was fantastic we will definitely be having this for dinner again soon
5,i made this recipe in my electric skillet rather than using my oven the fish cooked in a flash and we were sitting down to eat in less than hour from starttofinish went great with green beans amandine too
5,i didnt have capers so i just left them out my husand and i loved this the fish was tender and the flavor was just enough without being overpowering great with aparagus
5,this is now in my favorites cookbook so quick and so delicious i plan on trying different types of fish with this recipe
5,this recipe was pretty good instead of capers i used pepper
5,wow this was an amazingly easy and delicious way to fix fish the sauce tastes exactly like the chicken piccata sauce from my favorite italian restaurant i will definitely be making this one over and over
5,if i could give this stars i would my cakes turn out just like the picture and are absolutely wonderful because it is loaded with calories i save this for very special occasions
5,i made this for my daughters birthday it was amazing i have been baking for years and never expected such deliciousness from a recipe based on a boxed cake the frosting was decadent instead of making the chocolate lace for the top i used chocolate covered strawberries i am going to try alter this recipe to make a white chocolate cake for anyone thinking of trying this recipedo it you wont be disappointed
5,this is really good i made it in x pan because i had to travel with it and didnt want to worry about it falling over the strawberries at the store werent looking that good right now so i used canned cherry pie filling which was great i just drizzled the ganache over the top of the cherries ill make it again with strawberries when theyre looking better the frosting was great for those of you who complained about the butter you should try itits very good the one i made today was for a party at work and im making another one tomorrow to take for christmas eve dinner
5,deeelish a friend made it for my birthday and wow ill be making it for dads birthday

5,of all the desserts ive made this one is the one that has been the biggest hit amazing frosting on this cake and dont skip that ganache
5,ive made this several times very moist and delicious i did only use cups of real butter it worked fine the presentation was fabulous
5,i started making this recipe in when i was it in the magazine and havent stopped it is very rich so i only use a single layer at a time the cake minus frosting also freezes very well then i can thaw the cake and frost it for an easy item to bring i make of the butter frosting recipe for the single layer but keep the ganache the same i top with a variety of fruits including strawberries raspberries blue berries amp kiwi each single layer piece is still packed with flavor and allows for more servings with a large party
5,awesome super moist amp chocolatey i added strawberries to eat i definately think it was the best desssert at the party will make again
5,i made this cake for an auction the cake itself and rich and decadent the frosting seemed more like a mousse to me it wasnt too sweet but airy nothing to add on the ganache and strawberries they are what they are the auctioneer saved this to be the last thing auctioned off because it looked so good it sold for wow
5,i skipped the frosting all together and just dressed it up with ganache dribble centered with strawberries and blueberries i skipped the oil and did it with applesauce what a beautiful cake i wish i could post a picture im proud
5,super great recipe the cake was delicious and my family loved it the only thing i would change is the butter in the frosting just because i thought it was a little much it made a lot more than i needed so next time id reduce everything by half other than that perfect

5,delicious
5,very nice banana bread extremely easy and quick to make i doubled the recipe and instead of sugar i used a sugar substitute called whole earth sweetener co so i only needed half of the amount of sugar because its very sweet i baked it in a round cm pan on degrees im in australia for hours and for the last minutes i had to cover it with a piece of foil to stop it browning too much its quite moist and flavourful perfect with a cuppa next time i might add some cinnamon to the mix before bakinghmmmmmm thank you for a beautiful recipe my four children lloovveedd it my year old ate at least pieces in one sitting very good

5,my family loves this cake i have made it for birthdays and as a grooms cake i wish i would have thought to dip the strawberries first because that was my only complaintthat the berries release their juices when they touch the frosting i will continue to make this cakefantastic
5,i first had to make this cake for a christmas party people loved it and i have been making it ever since for the past couple years everytime someone has a party they call me for this cake it is delicious very rich easy to make and it looks like it takes forever i havent met anyone who dislikes this cake
5,i have been making this cake for over a year now lets just say anytime one of my kids or nieces or nephews have a birthday coming up they always request i make this i have doctored it occasionally substituting strong coffee for the water amp tbl of coffee liquor amp tsp of instant coffee grounds to the cake part i have also added the liquor to the frosting amp ganache i dont drink coffee myself but it really brings out the chocolate flavor i have also substituted the strawberries with raspberries if they look better at the store i have also added raspberries in between the layers amp i have chocolate dipped them on occasion to change it up a bit once you make this you will make it again enjoy
5,loved it
5,love love love it only change i would make is using chocolate mouse for icing color and taste work perfect with the rich ganache remember dont put the piped swirls in the freezer to set them they will be too soft at room temp
5,i have made this several times and it is excellent ive made both cupcakes and cakes using this recipethe only problem i have is that the cake always falls once i remove it from the ovendoes anyone else have this problem i tried lowering the oven temp to and baking it a few minutes longer but it still fallsany suggestions
5,ok so i teach high school culinary amp one of my students chose this recipe for our rodeo baking contest not only did she win st place in her division she won best of show amp the judges were asking for the recipe the only change we made was the frosting we used the wilton buttercream icing recipe amp it was perfect
5,this is an incredibly dense moist amp delicious chocolate cake it is similar to a recipe i got years ago for a bundt cake but this version uses less oil and works for a layered cake highly recommend
5,this has to be the best cake i have ever had i made this for a family gathering i followed directions exactly and it came out perfect it even looked like the cake in the pic everyone at the party commented on how delicious it was even my sister that is the district manager of the bakerys for a very well know grocery chain that trains employeesi am wondering if i could make a vanilla one using this recipe and subbing white cake mix and white chocolate chips i think ill give it a try
5,does anyone know how to convert this recipe to yield servings in a sheet cake shape instead please help baby shower in less than a week
5,i made this for our christmas day dessert it was a hit i loved making this beautiful cake the chocolate swirls were so easy and beautiful everyone was in awe thanks for such a great cake
5,i know its a strange question but what do you consider a regular size cake mix because im from the netherlands and i dont know if our cake mix is the same size but it looks amazing and i cant wait to bake this cake
5,delicious i used white chocolate flakes as a garnish instead of melting chocolate and making designs and i used store bought frosting the cake i followed the recipe exact and it was sooo good
5,i used all the ingrediants and followed the recipe exactly except that i coundnt find my cake carrier so at the last minute i made them into cupcakes they were perfect it made exactly cupcakes that i baked at the same temp as the recipe and minutes of baking was just right i had so many people tell me that it was the best cupcake they ever had i took me all day to make them since i have little ones at home but it was so worth it if you try this recipe you will not be disappointed i cant wait to make them for christmas eve
5,amazing taste and does not taste like a box cake i have made it several times i just leave out the decorative swirls they just melt every time i try to make them
5,pure yumminess
5,i have made this cake several times and it gets raves galore was told by an elderly gent that it was by far the best chocalate cake ever i have to agree it is moist and noone would ever guess it begins with a cake mix there is never any left overs
5,this cake was so easy to make and an absolute hit of the party
5,i have been making this cake since in appeared in the toh magazine a few years ago it is the most requested birthday cake in my family made one for an auction to raise money for our youth at churchit sold for i do put cups of confectioners sugar in the icing when i make it also if you dip the stem end of the strawberries in melted chocolate and let them cool on wax paper they dont leak on the icing when you make this cake in advance this one is really worth the effort
5,should clarify on the frostingwhen i make the inch cake i cut the butter in half i make the full pound of butter with cups of confectioners sugar and cups of cocoa when i make a inch layerdouble the cake recipecake plenty of frosting for the big cake
5,this caught my eye when i was looking for a cake to make for my moms birthday amazing made it a few times since then and have gotten a few joking marriage proposals because of this cake it was that good so rich and decadent i used frozen strawberries because they looked prettier and i did notice that i had way too much frosting if you want to make this cake even easier than it already is just get some basic milk chocolate frosting i used betty crocker and use that instead tasted exactly the same
5,this was so delicious the combination of chocolate and strawberry is amazing and i got many compliments on it the only problem i had was with the chocolate garnishes i got them made and on the cake but they got all droopy and wouldnt stay up after only a couple minutes also if you make this in advance i would follow georgeannes advice about dipping the strawberries first because i didnt and they did leak onto the frosting but it was still delicious
5,this is the best chocolate cake ive ever tasted it has had many compliments and to think that i made it
5,perfect texture love the chocolate frosting i went with a strawberry filling in the middle instead came out beautiful
5,i made this for two christmas parties last year and it was a hit with everyone i made the chocolate garnishes into musical notes very impressive when put together and not difficult at all to make a chocolate lovers dream
5,this cake was fabulous i had a difficult time eating too much of it knowing how much butter was in the frosting sticks i think next time i will use my own chocolate buttercream frosting recipe that calls for cup of butter instead the texture of the cake itself was superb the ganache and the chocolate garnish on top were very easy to make i loved the overall taste and appearance of the cake and will definitely make it again but with a less buttery frosting
5,i made this for my husbands birthday and had several people over everyone loved this cake and there was no leftovers my husband has already requested this every year in advance for his birthday cake the ganache was easy to make and so was the decorative garnishes which i actually spelled out his name i was worried because i only had a chocolate fudge cake mix but it turned out fine the cake was very moist and the icing was nice and smooth i will definitely be making this again
5,this cake is worth the time and effort my husband said it was the best looking and best tasting cake ive ever made
5,i made this cake for my sons birthday and it was so fun and delicious very moist and yummy he said it was the best cake he had ever had
5,got lots of compliments on this cake like eating chocolate covered strawberries best to let the frosted cake set upchill in the refrigerator before adding strawberries and ganache and then keep refrigerated until ready to serve the chocolate garnish are fun and easy to make and are a nice touch to an already beautiful and tasty cake
5,i made this for mothers day and a baby shower yummm best chocolate i have even made kids loved it
5,best chocolate cake ever
5,i love this cake any time i need a chocolate cake this is the one i make i dont always use the same frosting or toppings though
5,this frosting has a pound of butter in it but you know what this frosting is amazing the ganache just puts it over the top but the frosting my oh my use it on your own choc cake recipe if you arent sure about the cake part
5,try using coffee instead of the water omgosh good
5,there really is no other choc cake recipe tha compairs i leave off the strawberries and add just a sprinkle of sea salt in the middle and on the top yum
5,i made this cake for my sons high school graduation party it was awesome everyone loved it so fun to make it was almost too pretty to eat cant wait to make again
5,this was a hit at our family christmas party i put more ganache on and grandpa asked if i really made it or bought it
5,this cake is delicious ive made it twice now and i definitely prefer using a devils food cake mix over a milk chocolate mix the chocolate flavor is more intense which i prefer im usually not a fan of buttercream frostings but this one is pretty good and i love the ganache over the top it really balances out the sweetness of the chocolate buttercream i personally dont like really thick frosting on my cakes and i felt there was too much buttercream the second time i made this cake i only made half and it was the perfect amount of frosting in my opinion very delicious cake
5,i did a fundraiser at a missions trip youth auction to do a dessert a month for months i did this one as the first one to present that day so people could see what kind of goodies they would be getting people thought it was fake it was so pretty it helped bring in for the auction this was well worth the time
5,i made this for our christmas dinner for work dec it was awesome i made to of these cakes last christmas i am planning to make it again in the next few weeks sue
5,very excellent everyoneone loves it
5,made this for my grandmothers birthday got more compliments on this cake than anything ive ever made before i dont like chocolate on chocolate cake typically but this is my favorite cake now
5,i tried this cake just to see if it was like other chocolate cakes but it is much more my family always calls me to make this special cake on all occasions it is fun and decorative and is fun for all to enjoy i even made cupcakes out of it for a birthday party and it was a huge it thank you to the lady who was runner up its with my famil
5,sooo beautiful it was very rich but my husband loved the richness
5,the cake was moist and delicious and it wasnt too much trouble to make i would probably use my own ganache recipe for the top next time as i like it better but this is a fabulous recipe for a great chocolate cake
5,got many rave reviews on this cake wasnt so sure that it was going to be so great because i thought that the cake was dense and that their was too much butter in the frosting but after it was all put together and chilled in the fridge it was excellent
5,deliciousso rich and heavymy new go to cake for a grooms cake or tiered chocolate the cake alone is heavy enough to hold up to stacking this cake was very moist and delicious and i recieved many compliments i would definitely make this againicing needs either meringe powder or less milk for decorating purposes but if made as shown in the picture the recipe works great i would definitely make this cake again and again and again
5,i made this cake for my sisters birthday and there were no left overs it was very good it took a while to decorate but it was very fun and easy to decorate so time actually went by really fast i will definitely be making this again
5,very very good cake will make again next time raspberries after reading some of the reviews people were having trouble with the frosting i creamed the butter and alternated the powdered sugarcocoa and milk turned out great the ganache was a little runny next time i will add c whipping cream i made this for a dinner party and everyone cleaned their plate they like that it wasnt to sweet
5,i thought this cake would be hard to make but it turned out beautifully it tasted fantastic and i got tons of compliments this is a great cake for entertaining and turns out just as pretty as the picture
5,i have made this twice it is so delicious and moist everyone loves it
5,awesome recipe simple and delicious
5,love love love this recipe and was so easy to make moist and delicious gone in a couple of hours
5,this is now my go to recipe for banana bread we made a loaf with chocolate chips and a loaf with walnuts excellent
5,this was delicious i made one with chocolate chips and the other with toasted walnuts
5,just as it says the best ever banana nut bread i have made this nut bread six times three times for friends and three for myself i did however use coconut rum and vanilla extract one teaspoon each and raw cane sugar instead of regular sugar the very best ive ever had
5,this banana bread is very good and moist ive made it several times with and without the nuts and everytime its tasty the cook time might be a bit long bc mine comes out a little darker than id expect but the taste is still really good regardless
5,this banana bread is outstanding i have never had better and so simple to make i have made at least times with a perfect outcome each bake i do use mashed bananas and like another viewer use just a touch of sugar on top before baking any banana bread ive ever tried was too dry but not this one super moist and sooooo delicious winner here i highly recommend cnaquin
5,the title says it all i use brown sugar instead of white i leave out the nuts just a personal preference sometimes i add chocolate chips in place of the nuts
5,excellent ad easy i sprinkled some sugar on top and it was excellent with our morning coffee i said was it was gone fast i will be making this regularly
5,my family and i loved the bread i used pecans instead of walnuts i only used cup of buttermilk i dont understand how an extra tablespoon could make a difference i will definitely make again
5,this is without a doubt the best banana nut bread recipe i have ever found i always have bananas and have made countless different recipes but never found one i really liked until i made this one i followed the directions from start to finish and wouldnt change a thing this bread is so moist and has the best flavor i would completely agree with its namebest ever banana nut bread
5,i have used this recipe for yearswith the addition of cinnamon nutmeg cloves and ginger i personally find banana bread boring without the spice i also add walnuts and sometimes chocolate chips to batter the best base recipe in use this for making pumpkin bread or zucchini it freezes very well and often is better once thawed out
5,banana bread has never been my favorite turns out i had the wrong recipe after making this its now my favorite title didnt lie this is the best ever banana bread
5,ive tried many best banana bread recipes but this one really is best it is very moist and ive found others too dry for my liking i did the recipe as written except had bananas that needed to be used flavor is good and makes large loaf i will definitely be making again
5,this cake while very fancy looking was extrmely easy to make it was rich and delicious i made it to take to a friends house when we went for dinner and everyone loved this cake even those of us who are not normally thrilled with chocolate cake my only suggestion do not read the nutrition facts just enjoy the cake i definitely will make this elegant cake again
5,this was so simple and easy i am making it for a bridal shower as the bride requested chocolate and strawberries how perfect i made a practice cake before the shower and it was so easy except i used a choc marshmallow fondant over the icing because my icing is never perfect it was delicious
5,i have made this cake a couple of times it was really good one thing i did leave out the second time was the cup of milk in the frosting the frosting to me did not need the milk it was much easier to work with without it but a great cake
5,made for christmas did not use strawberries but decorated the top with holiday mampms i decreased the frosting a bit used less stick of butter and slightly less sugar cocoa and milk it still turned out enough and delicious one of the best chocolate cakes ive ever had
5,absolutely fun and fantastic yummy did not follow frosting recipe felt it was too much butter used a chocolate butter cream recipe that used tablespoons just as good will definitely make this again
5,two teenage girls made this with little help it was delicious and moist wonderful combination of ingredients we will definitely make this again
5,the best chocolate cake i have ever made it was so impressive and so delicious i dont ever want to lose this recipe
5,i already reviewed this and not sure why it didnt post ive made this cake times to rave reviews there seems to be some question about the amount of butter in the frosting it is correct the flavor is chocolatey and butter and the consistency is soft but oh so good
5,i made this for my sisters birthday and it was a very big hit would definitely recommend it
5,this cake is to die for probably the best chocolate cake ive ever made absolutely delicious and pretty easy to make just dont look at the calories and fat
5,i made this in square x pans and bunched straberries to the center it looked amazing and i was told by baking women that is was the best chocolate cake they have ever had
5,i just made this for my husbands birthday via a request from him after he saw the magazine cover picture it turned out very delicious i would not place the strawberries on top next time although it makes for a beautiful cake the strawberries go bad before we can eat the cake i would serve it with strawberries on the side next time i dont understand the others problems with the frosting we loved it not to sweet and it wasnt too soft as others saidbeing as it is december i had a hard time finding nice strawberries my husband loved it i would also leave off the ganache as it is just not needed the frosting is rich enough without it
5,fantastic cake recipe and very easy super moist my family isnt crazy about the butter icing so i switch to a cool whip and chocolate pudding icing the combination of chocolate and strawberries was delicious and it looked beautiful i took this to our annual family christmas gathering and it was a hit
5,a showstopper a bit laborintensive but so worth it the frosting is amazing would make this anytime for a special occasion
5,i made my own chocolate frosting which was similar to this one and we loved it this cake was easy and a total show stopper next time though i am using raspberries rather than strawberries as we prefer those
5,made this for christmas day and everyone loved it definitely a cake that gets noticed thinking of making a th of july version and make white frosting and white choc swirl sticks and then have blueberries and strawberries such a great recipe
5,this was the best cake id ever madeso delicios
5,made it for my daughters birthdaycould not justify lb of butter in the frosting so used sticks and it turned out great
5,this cake got rave reviews at christmas very light and airy not overly sweet or rich at all the frosting was just delicious
5,this is the best chocolate cake i have ever made it is moist for days after its made this will now be the cake i will always make when choclate cake is requested excellent
5,won rave reviews will definately make again i agree this is laborintensive especially because i doubled it the first time i made it and was worried to try it out christmas day i used cake mixes in x in pans was afraid it wouldnt be enough for everyone i had to increase the baking time of course kept checking for doneness ended up minutes at same temp didnt need x frosting and really not x ganache but i used all of it i cut the strawberries in half to cover larger cake surface i used choc chips for the semisweet chocolate and melted in microwavethat worked great next time i will use a plastic bag with hole snipped in corner to pipe the decorative designs never got runny enough to drizzle from a spoon and was a mess to get out of my cake decorator once it hardened transported the decorations in a shirt box wrapped in waxed paper and inserted just before we ate dessert swore i would not make again if it was only as good as the box mix but everyone raved i guess it will become a tradition
5,oh my goodness would i make this again absolutely i made it for a family gathering over christmas and everyone loved it im making it tonight for a coworkers birthday tomorrow one little tip wrap your cakes in saran wrap then reynolds wrap and freeze until firm this really helps in making the cake easy to trip and frost such a beautiful and scrumptious case i dont mind the time involved whatsoever
5,cherries and almond is a perfect combo
5,i love when you dont have a slew of ingredients to make a great dessert as tasty as this the eggs gave this the rise it needed and the cherries and almond glaze topped it off perfectly great recipe that is definitely a keeper
5,i cut the ingredients in half and baked in a x baking dish i also used a cookie scoop to put the remaining dough on top its more cake like and the top looks like individual biscuits with cherry filling tastes delicious i used a combo of heavy whipping creamwater in the glaze since i was out of milk wondering if this needs to be refrigerated since the glaze has cream in it
5,whoever did the cooking in this video has the most beautiful hands
5,i baked half a recipe in a x glass baking pan for minutes i havent tried it yet as its still cooling but its golden brown on the top and bottom thanks so much for sharing an easy recipe they look delicious
5,loved this recipe my husbands favorite but why no print icons to use anymore
5,ive made these several times and everyone loves them especially my picky husband the only change i made was i sprinkled a handful of slivered almonds and a couple pinches of cinnamon over the top i did bake minutes and was perfectly light golden brown and done easy tasty and beautiful on the dinner table thank you
5,these were really good bars i had a can of strawberry pie filling to use up so i only made of the bar recipe but used the glaze recipe to pipe on top and made it a really thick consistency topping once they were completely cool i made this in an x baking dish and it came out perfect although i did allow it to bake for minutes next time ill try the recipe in a x i think the key is to have a thin layer of bar on the bottom and increase the time a bit to assure its done i didnt use the almond extract that seemed odd to me but will try the almond slivers like others ill be making these for company in the future i think theyd be wonderful on a brunch buffet
5,the cake looked so great we didnt want to cut in to it it was easy to make and delicious
5,i thought this was heaven the frosting was alittle too soft so i just kept it chilled yum
5,i made this for my neighbor for his birthday he raved about it repeatedly his wife said it was the very best chocolate cake she had ever eaten i had to agree in baking this cake i found that it took longer than the minutes it called for to bake throughly the frosting was soft but easily spread without running and it was delicious i couldnt get the ganache to harden so i just dripped it over the strawberries and down the sides of the cake it was superb and the cake i thought was going to be dried out from extra baking time but it was beautifully moist a real surprise for excellency because it was formed from a cake mix i will definitely bake this again
5,this recipe was very easy i made no changes and had no difficulty getting the crust to cook completely i did not have to bake the crust separately as one reviewer suggested i used this recipe to make for my customers the bar was absolutely delicious the crust was moist yet sturdy to hold the cherry filling will definitely make again
5,this recipe turned out very well i used one can of cherry pie filling and one jar of preserved sour cherries because thats what i had on hand i will definitely make this again

5,i have made these bars several times very good and easy to make
5,with a few left over pantry items during covid quarantine this was a hit i didnt have almond extract so used a bit more vanilla extract crust was amazing good cherry pie filling was ok but would have added some fresh cherries to really make it pop

5,this has become a family favorite it is easy to make and everyone loves it
5,good recipe i substituted cup brown sugar plus cup white sugar i also slightly toasted and cooled the walnuts prior to folding them into the batter i buttered the pan and coated it with flour as well i like the buttermilk the texture was outstanding i will make this often
5,best flavored banana bread i have ever had the english walnuts add that special crunch and flavor this is a keeper i didnt change a thing it will replace my regular banana bread recipe thank you
5,i havent actually put this recipe to the test yet because we just installed a different oven last night and i still need to clean it but the main reason is that i have a special needs diet so i will have to substitute almost every ingredient in order to be able to eat it safely im not sure if anyone else out there is a vegandiabetic with no immune system but if you are then youve got a friend the good news is that so far the things i have made substitutions for have been on me and my family so i will be happy to share the rating and the substitutions used if anyone is interestedor i could just write a book lol
5,so easy and tasty this truly is delicious the taste that i was looking for weve toasted our slices and had it with butter and it was simply delish thank you for the recipe for the first time ever i wish i had more bananas to bake more breads
5,delicious and tasty used cup less sugar and it was plenty sweet husband says it a keeper shared with family thank you
5,as advertised this recipe truly is the best banana bread ever since finding this recipe a month ago i have made three loaves my husband can not eat it fast enough i shortened the cooking time to hour minutes i think it depends on the type of pan you use results are amazing definitely will cook again and again
5,i have used a lot of different recipes but this one is by far the best my mom always put the bread on a paper plate when almost completely cooled and placed into a sealed plastic bag overnight and it makes it so moist i will use this recipe again
5,it was wonderful i made two loaves and put chocolate chips in one they were both delicious this recipe will be added to my favorite recipes
5,i love this banana bread never ever had i used a different recipe
5,my favorite banana bread recipe i make it as muffins which bake for around minutes delicious
5,its true its the best banana bread that ive ever made or tasted i used pecans as thats what i had on hand muffins great idea be sure to use a larger loaf sized pan baking time varies my bake time over an hour vfe a must try
5,absolutely delicious this really is the best banana bread mine baked at for about an hour and a half i used the chocolate chip option instead of walnuts and threw in a handful of leftover toffee bits as well this bread is moist on the inside with a crispy crust on the outside cant say enough about it we loved it and will definitely make again vfe
5,so delicious and easy to make you can put add ins if you want to change it up for your family but it is good just as written will file this one for future use
5,i made the recipe as given but substituted toasted pecans for the walnuts and baked in paper lined muffin pans this recipe made regular size muffins these were very moist and delicious i will definitely make these again
5,very good recipe delish question i would like to add chocolate chips instead of the walnuts grandkids prefer the chocolate chips how much would i add cup like the chopped walnuts and what about a mixture of chocolate chips and nuts cup of each
5,so delicious reminds me of a pastry we use to make at the bakery i worked at in during high school
5,perfect for our canada celebrations this up coming weekend cooking for and this is one of the desserts i chose to make perfect amp festive
5,these cherry bars are sooo moist but not too sweet we love these the possibilities are endless with canned pie filling and extracts used to complement the fruit yummy
5,heres a little trick i use to make my glaze sugar free i take sugar free vanilla frosting and put it in the microwave for seconds make sure the foil top is removed just long enough to be pourable as a glaze i dont use much just enough for squiggles on top flavorings like almond extract can also be added by the teaspoon after microwaving
5,my husband and i loved this recipe i will reduce the sugar by and continue to use the icing next timei halved the recipe and used x baking pan and cooked min delicious
5,this is a fantastic dessert to feed a crowd i was a bit skeptical of how thick my batter was to spread on the bottom of my pan but it all baked up just fine these cut best for me after chilling slightly delicious
5,when you really want a pie but want to make it in bulk these bars are the answer this is now top of my potluck recipe list i didnt have a x pan so instead used two x cake pans and just split up the recipe between the two so my bars probably werent quite as thick but were still delicious this was so easy to make and its flexible too you can use blueberry or some other pie filling for a different flavor also this keeps well it doesnt need to be refrigerated and can sit out without getting weird making it perfect for any party or to have on the counter at work to go with the daily coffee break
5,i first made cherry bars when they were published in taste of home in but after moves misplaced the recipe so glad to find it here this is quick easy absolutely delicious keeps well and travels well as some other have noted the glaze is quite sweet and about half what the recipe calls for is enough for me a real keeper
5,i made these for work to celebrate birthdays and work anniversaries they were a big hit
5,this was a great recipe everyone loved them and pretty easy to make loved it
5,i made this for the first time yesterday july i did not make the glaze as others recommended this is delicious i will definitely make this again and again
5,super easy to make like others recommended i used only one can of pie filling flipped the proportions of vanilla and almond extracts and sprinkled a handful of chocolate chips could also do without the drizzle or at least reduce it by half hubby thought the bottom cookie was too thick but i liked it next time ill reduce the dough on the bottom and add it to the top i also baked it for minutes and then turned the oven off and let it sit in there for another min with the door cracked it was perfectly done portions seems optimistic but even small bitesized squares hold up nicely as a finger food dessert
5,we love these bars at my house i have made them several times and have even taken some to school for a bake sale
5,made these today as a valentine surprise for home they are so easyexcellent flavoreveryone loves them made exactly as written will try again with blueberry pie filling and raspberry bet they would be great with lemon curd too
5,with a few minor differences this has been a favorite recipe in my home and community for a good many years we use only can of cherry fillingi cannot imagine how wet it would be with cans try using an apricot pie filling for another very special treat havent made them for quite some time but we all cut them to be a generous size so the yield is not out of a jelly roll size panfarmerjoy
5,very good will make again i added tsp almond extract instead of the th i also had to increase the baking time to mins i used powdered sugar instead of the icing
5,i loved these and adjusted nothing except adding some minutes to the bake time they remind me of something my grandma used to make but better with the glaze and almond flavoring they were a big hit at the family gathering too
5,a total hit with my family i adapted it for fewer servings using an x pan and omitted all the almond extract because im not a fan i added sliced almonds on top of the pie filling instead mine took the full bake time definitely making this again
5,we liked this recipe i made as is
5,i made the recipe exactly and put on smaller cookie sheet it was deliciousand simple to maketry with a scoop of vanilla icecreamyummywill definitely make again
5,delicious is kind of like a cherry pie with a sugar cookie crust didnt have the right sized pan i need another piece of bakeware like i need a hole in the head so i used a x because of smaller pan the dessert was too thick and juicy to cut into bars even though i cooked it quite a bit longer will continue to tinker until it works in a x it really doesnt matter about pan size because its going to be fantastic no matter what
5,very good easy will make again i also used only one can of cherries amp extra almond extractamp cooked minutes longer pays to look at reviews i loved the cherries and will try peaches too
5,i have made this many times and it is my brotherinlaws favorite dessert people love it i have also used peach pie filling
5,i have tried this recipe and have found it to be a very good one it was very delicious and i would use it again

5,i have used this recipe for over years my family loves it i even make it in round cake pans and take it to bake sales and they are gone in minutes for a good price i also change up the pie filling mine doesnt call for the glaze it has you sift powdered sugar over the top after it is cool we love it as coffee cake in the morning too my grandchldren cant get enough of it
5,these bars are exceptional soooo delicious i made these bars and took them to church i had so many people come up to me and tell me just how yummy they are i made these exactly as the recipe states except i used blackberry pie filling instead of the cherry thank you
5,really good i will definitely make these again but will cup less sugar
5,these are great to you people who dont bake well dont comment unles you make them why would you comment about them not sweet enough with cups of sugar then another cupof sugar in the glazedont bring down the rating on a winning recipe ikeep seeing the same people with down grading great recipes very intrested in the blackberry filling this recipe can be used with many different fillings
5,better than i expected they were great i used raspberry filling since that was what i had on hand
5,these bars are sooo good the only changes cup less sugar and added tsp baking powder excellent recipe
5,i tried them for the first time for easter they went over very well and were easy to make i used can pie filling mixed with frozen cherries picked last year to make up the difference for second can no extra sugar was needed and turned out great i did add tsp baking powder to dough will be making again
5,these were easy to make and very good i did add slivered almonds to the top and that made it even better
5,very good and easy to make i also reduced the sugar by cup added tsp baking powder and omitted the almond extract i have made these cherry bars in the past with powdered sugar sprinkled on top but the hint of glaze was even better
5,two big thumbs up from our family of four easy simple and delicious recipe we halved and made in a x casserole dish cooled and drizzled the glaze looks and tastes as good as it came from a bakery yes i did bake an extra few minutes to obtain the golden color loved the almond extract flavor will be making again soon i am sure and would like to experiment with different fruit filling for variation yum ps just made a pan using peach filling still amazing this is a fabulous recipe
5,love this recipe i never liked banana bread but this recipe has changed my mind i have mad it several times now and also gave a loaf to relatives who also loved it easy to make and freezes well my mom likes to slice and bag it separately for the freezer then she has a snack that thaws quickly i would do the same but we wind up eating it all before i can freeze any definitely recommend trying this recipe
5,i use cup of bananas whatever nuts i have on hand sometimes i add cups blueberries takes longer to cook sometimes apples i like to cook these in miniloave pans i get four out of the recipe for blueberry i cooked for min all others mins
5,very easy moist and delicious a keeper for sure

5,this really is the best banana bread recipe actually i use the pampered chef brownie pan and make muffins using the recipe makes and baking time is about minutes i lessen the sugar to cup sometimes i add mini chocolate chips i also use this recipe with ground zucchini using the full amount of sugar i grind or finely grate the zucchini and squeeze out the moisture
5,i made this recipe into muffins yield medium sized and mini muffins i swapped cup of the sugar for splenda and used cup of regular sugar i added mini chocolate chips and cup of walnuts excellent will make it into a loaf next time as well
5,i had ripe bannas so i used all of them in this recipe used cake flour i did not have butter milk but made my own with heavy cream and white vinegar which turned into a sour cream consistency used banna extract and vanilla omitted the nuts poured into bundt pan for some reason some of it stuck to the sides of the pan so will try loaf pan w parchment next timemade a frosting with heavy cream powder sugar pinch salt cinnamon this was a hit i will definitely use this recipe again

5,i have made this recipe several times my family and neighbors like it at it always burns the bottom and the ends today i was determined to get a good one i started at but after reading some reviews lowered the temperature to that made a nice banana bread not burnt the bread bakes dark also i baked it for hr min given how many people have the burnt ends i think taste of home should make a correction or a comment
5,this recipe has an amazing flavor i did change a few things i divided my sugar cup white cup brown sugar i also used milk with a tablespoon lemon juice to substitute for the buttermilk that i didnt have i also lowered my temp to i was using a cast iron bread pan it cooks hotter i only cooked it for hr then let it cool for the minutes loved the parchment paper it definitely made clean up easier thank you for a tasty recipe
5,great recipe i like my mac and cheese creamy like this i added some panko to to the top for a little crunch
5,thumbs up because my mama taught me not to talk with my mouthful nom nom nom came out perfect and i doubled the recipe this recipe is a winner
5,hands down the best macampcheese recipe the entire family loved it it is very creamy and smooth instead of velveeta cheese i used medium cheddar and i doubled the amount of parmesan cheese i also used heavy cream instead of milk you only need about cup of heavy whipping cream
5,was sooo cheesy wonderful no more instant box macaroni and cheese
5,instead of using the velveeta cube i dont like the way velveeta taste i substituted it with cambells cheese soup and it turned out great
5,this is one of my favorite recipes i noticed a lot of complaints at the sauce so heres what ive found you can really half the sauce to the same amount of pasta or you can add in some extras like broccoli or ham etc i sometimes like the extra sauce so i will make an extra cup of macaroni to the regular sauce i was really wanting this macaroni last night but didnt have any velveeta i used monterey jack cheese instead and it still turned out yummy
5,the very best mac and cheese recipe loved it
5,best mac n cheese i found yet if you love cheese this ones for you did have a lot of cheese sauce so i added more pasta

5,let me start by saying i never review recipes that i try this one i had to i found this recipe about months ago and made it not holding out much hope that my kids would like itthey never like homemade mac and cheese the family devoured this casserole then i lost the recipe and couldnt find it until yesterday they devoured it again some changes did have to be made i used a whole box of bow ties and needed a little bit more it was very saucy i like it like that so it didnt bother me yes the sauce does get a little too thick i just slowly added chicken broth to get to a good consistency for us grate your own cheese it makes a world of difference in that grainy taste plus its cheaperi can finally stop looking for a mac and cheese recipe this will be the only one i ever make again thanks for a great recipe
5,i have made this dish to pass at church carryins and most recently to my inlaws for thanksgiving dinner everyone who has tried this has loved it it is easy to make and the thick creaminess cant be beat i almost always have the ingredients for this on hand this is hands down my familys favorite homemade mac n cheese

5,terrific best macaroni and cheese ever
5,this mac and cheese tastes as good as it looks in the picture its definitely a keeper i followed the recipe as written but did omit the cheddar cheese it was plenty cheesy without it i also added panko bread crumbs to the top of the casserole when it came out the oven yum this recipe was easy to split in half i used a quart baking dish and baked it for minutes at degrees for half the recipe excellent
5,made this for my book club but used sour cream instead of buttermilk which i was out of it came out great they all asked for recipe
5,in place of the cup of oil i used another cup of mashed banana ate it with a spread of butter on each slice delish
5,i made this bread with one minor twist i live in fl and i have been collecting fresh mangoes every day on my way to work i only had one ripe banana and a plethora of ripe ripe mangoes so i did g of ripe banana puree and g of fresh mango puree it turned out super tasty with gorgeous hues i divided the batter into mini loaves and baked for minutes in my mini bread stone pan until the toothpick came out clean this way i was able to share the love a little further and pass out mini loaves to my coworkers neighboors and friends
5,this is the best recipe for banana bread ive ever tried ive used it for over years it says it doesnt double well so i tripled it it makes two large loaves after tripling my question is can i substitute pumpkin purée for the bananas to make this into pumpkin bread with the appropriate spices i know i could experiment but id rather ask first thank you

5,my family loves this ive altered it only a bit instead of heavy cream i just use regular milk because i always have it on hand it tastes the same great recipe
5,absolutely awesome ive been making this since i first saw it in the magazine years ago ive sometimes used pinto beans instead of white beans to save money and adjusted the heat level depending on who would be eating it but i always have people beg for the recipe
5,we thought this chili was absolutely fantastic my husband said he would take this to his next chili cook off at work although the chili was great it was a bit too spicy for the younger ones in my family but to be fair they really dont eat anything with any spiciness at all we will make this again and again
5,i made this on thanksgiving for my family and everyone loved it best mac n cheese ever and the kids kept going back for seconds lol

5,finally my quest for the perfect mac amp cheese recipe is over this is exactly what ive been looking for
5,this is the best mac and cheese recipe ever however i do use an entire pound of macaroni elbow or shells its still very cheesy make in xx pan i use lower fat cheese to help reduce a few calories you can substitute mayonnaise for the sour cream if you dont have any on hand my tip for making this is to measure all the ingredients ahead of time and have them all laid out on the counter ready to go yummy
5,best mac and cheese ever i only used about tablespoons of flour makes alot of sauce very yummy
5,yum this was both easy and tasty butter cheese more cheese a really good dinner

5,ive made this recipe several times and it just seems to get better every time i make it super easy recipe and very tasty
5,oh yeah this mac amp cheese really rocks i did follow another raters advice in that i increased the milk to cups and reduced the flour to cup and it proved to be the perfect consistency i admit this is not a lowcal or lowfat dish but its fun to splurge once in a while and this one is worth it
5,amazing dish which was easy to cook and tasted great the next day as left overs
5,i am a cook at a retirement home everyone loves my mac amp cheese old time recipe i tried this one on my family amp they loved itwe think this is the ultimate macaroni amp cheese the only one i will make for my family now thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe

5,have made these cookies several times and always get rave reviews i send these cookies to my grandsons in japan every christmas and easter number one on their wish list
5,i did not need dozen cookies so i used half of all ingredients except for the oats i used the cup the recipe called for and omitted the nuts i also sprinkled flake coconut on top this is now my favorite oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe the vanilla pudding really adds body to the cookies and the texture and flavor are terrific
5,these are soooo good will be making them again for sure
5,this was an amazing recipe i and my mother did it and the family had a special treat for after dinner so good and scrumptious
5,everyone i share these cookies with always raves about them
5,what a great oatmeal cookie since its just the two of us i did cut the recipe in half the cookies were delicious and i will definitely be making them again
5,i made these and used them for ice cream sandwiches they were a hit and everyone loved them with the homemade ice cream i did not use the pudding mix since i did not have any
5,great cookie made about doz but i used a tbsp size scoop so i am sure that made a difference very moist and chewy in center
5,yum so easy to make and really good
5,can you use baking powder turns out i dont have soda i have made these before they are always delicious
5,this is a very good recipe everyone loves it every time i make it
5,i sprinkle a can of cheddar flavored french fried onions over the top of this before putting it in the oven my husband who claims to only like boxed macaroni and cheese loves this recipe every time i bring it somewhere everyone asks for the recipe and raves about it
5,the only thing i changed in this recipe was that i sauteed some onion with the butter my husband loves onion with his macncheese fabulous recipe
5,i used milk amp used all reduced fat cheeses amp sour cream amp this was great nice amp creamy thick amp rich great dish will definitely make again although i question it serving mine made a by baking dish amp when used as a side would easily feed maybe if it were the entree
5,this was just the recipe ive been looking for for a long time i used new york sharp cheddar for my shredded cheddar the sauce seemed a bit thick so before baking i added more milk to it bringing the total amount of milk to and cups i needed to bake it for minutes to get it golden brown and bubbly this recipe is a real keeper
5,this is my new mac amp cheese recipe it does seem a little thick when youre making the sauce but hang with it when it comes out of the oven its amazing
5,i am not a baker but you dont have to be these cookies i baked for church were fabulous and so easy rave reviews
5,to make things easier i melted the butter before whisking in the sugar and i made them into bars using a xx jelly roll pan baking for about minutes until lightly browned around the edges let them cool completely before cuttingeating because they probably wouldnt have held together too well out of the oventhey were absolutely delicious the oats were a little crispy and they were very tasty my husband is trying to keep them all for himself i usually wouldnt make a recipe using convenience items like vanilla pudding but i happened to have some in bulk i needed to use up cup a package
5,these were quite tasty i loved the texture additions of the oatmeal and nuts they are a nice change of pace from the usual regular chocolate chip or oatmeal cookies
5,i changed a few things i used sugarfree pudding and chocolate chips splenda to replace white sugar splenda brown sugar blend cup and old fashioned oats because thats what i had they were a little drier than other cookies i have made but they did hold together just fine i was surprised mine did not flatten out but looked like haystacks when baked nd batch i flattened before baking they tasted fine either way and i will make these again thanks for a healthier cookie recipe i only got dozen but used a medium cookie scoop so that is probably why
5,perfect cookie for dunking crispy on the outside soft on the inside i used a medium cookie scoop and baked them at degrees for minutes convection setting i flattened them slightly when they came out of the oven
5,amazing this might be my new favorite cookie plenty of chocolate chips even for this chocolate lover i only had while chocolate pudding mix but otherwise followed the directions exactly other than making the cookies a bit bigger
5,the absolute best oatmeal cookie recipe i have ever made
5,these cookies are delicious they turned out chewy and have a nice amount of chocolate i used old fashioned oats as i did not have the quick cooking on hand
5,not fair to rate a recipe lower because it sounds good but you havent tried it dont rate it until you try it and for heavens sake dont change an ingredient ie quick oatmeal to old fashioned and blame the recipe if your cookies are dry old fashioned does make a drier chewier cookie as it soaks up more moisture from the eggs and butter the oats are uncut and uncooked i always substitute while oats but then it isnt the same recipe is it
5,these are great they have a nice crispy surface and chewy inside ill be making these again but perhaps adding c chips i bet theyre great with dark chips as well thanks for sharing
5,very good but my cookbook taste of home best loved recipes says rounded tsp not tbsp so minutes was the max time as they browned pretty fast
5,these are phenomenal i added shredded carrots and peanut butter to die for
5,i just made these and i love the texture but they are too sweet for my taste i wonder if i left the pudding out if it would change them too much
5,these cookies were simple to make i omitted the nuts food allergy but otherwise followed the recipe exactly they were delicious this recipe makes plenty of cookies so i froze half this just might be my go to chocolate chip cookie recipe from now on
5,perfect cookies and easy to make
5,stop looking this is the best oatmeal chocolate cookie recipe not only did it make a lot of cookies each cookie looked great baked for min then let them sit on cookie sheet as a volunteer food editor for taste of home friends and family expect great cookies from my kitchen these cookies did not disappoint
5,absolutely delicious i didnt have instant vanilla pudding mix but i did have chocolate pudding mix they turned out so well especially since im a chocolate addict
5,never know for sure when it says butter is it salted or unsalted
5,excellent cookie ti enjoy with a cup of coffee my granddaughter wanted to bake cookies today we did the only change we had to make was not enough of regular choc chips used to different brands as well as size of chip baked each batch for only minutes
5,these cookies are fantastic i followed the recipe exactly and my cookies came out perfectly best choc oatmeal cookie recipe ive come across
5,i made these twice over memorial weekend to bring to two different events and these were a huge hit at both places i think this may be the best chocolate chip recipe yet
5,great cookie recipe i left out the nuts just because i am not a fan but these still turned out really good however where the recipe says to drop by round teaspoonfuls they mean really rounds ones i tried just regularly rounded to begin with and my cookies were about the size of a silver dollar they still tasted good but they were a little hard in the next batch i really rounded up the teaspoon and got the correct size of cookie and it was softer in the centerthe only thing i might change next time is to try adding some raisins
5,ive made these twice now to take to gatherings with friends and they always receive great reviews the only thing that i would note is that i dont think the recipe makes dozen cookies i made a half batch last night and probably got around small cookies out of it
5,delicious perfect when craving oatmeal and chocolate
5,these cookies were delicious the only difference is that i cut the sugars in half everyone raved about them
5,everyone liked thesei made half a recipe and got cookies using my small tbsp cookie scoopi also cut the sugar but only to about of the original amount they still are sweeter than i like them i also used whole wheat flour
5,these were simply delicious the only thing i did differently was i use the small chocolate covered raisins in place of the chocolate chips i had some left over from the holidays and thought this was a great way to use them up will continue to make this way for my family but if you are not a raisin fan these are outstanding as the recipe is written
5,pawesomep
5,awesome
5,i didnt have the beans so i made it without amp it was more like a soup it was delicious i will definitely make this again and again and again
5,my husband is very picky he loved it
5,this chili is really good i add milk instead of whipping cream i think the whipping cream is too sweet only one can of chilies and cup grated cheddar cheese right before serving my husband said it tasted amazing

5,been making this for years for church and famliy events when we take it to the chili cookoffs its always the first to go and usually the pot is scraped almost clean its always a big hit i have even used turkey and cooked dry white beans in a crockpot to make this still just fantastic

5,these are excellent my family loves them my husband had accidentally bought cook and serve vanilla pudding and i couldnt tell any difference they were delicious
5,since i didnt check my pantry before starting the recipe i used both crisco and butter in place of the latter one packet of dream whip in place of the instant vanilla pudding only one cup of chocolate chips since thats all i had and one cup of toffee bits to make up for the missing mixins despite all of these changes the cookies were chewy moist and very tasty ive added it to my recipe box

5,this is the best oatmeal cookie recipe ive ever come across i brought some to a party this weekend and everybody said the same thing they are delicious i made them with minichocolate chips instead this is now the only oatmeal cookie for me and my family
5,im not sure how this is lowerfat but they are definately yummy my whole family loved these chewy cookies i only got dozen cookies instead of the the recipe suggests so the recipe cookies must be bitesize cookies yummyyummy
5,these cookies are fabulous i have replaced my old recipe for this one this is a keeper my husband love the dough and my children love the cookies with all my cookies i will use my pampered chef mini scoop and make cookie dough balls and line them up on a baking sheet then freeze them until hard i then store the dough balls in a marked ziploc bag in the freezer this way we can have homemade cookies whenever we want and not have to bake or dozen
5,these are great as written but i added a twisti used banana instant pudding i love the combination of banana walnuts amp chocolate the banana flavor was very lighti may kick it up a bit next time by using tsp vanilla and banana extract be sure not to overbakemine definitely had to come out of the oven at the minute mark to be soft amp chewyenjoy
5,update the next day the cookies were on the hard side i put a slice of bread in with them and they softened up when i make them again i plan on adding a mashed banana as suggested by another reviewerim hoping that will make them softer and give them a little banana flavor
5,mmmmmm very yummy cookie everyone i shared them with thought so too the second time making them i used white chocolate flavor pudding hard to imagine them tasting any better than the original but they were it was a very subtle difference but a good one im a stickler for freshtasting baked goods and these were too dry for me the second day they were still very good just not the same as the first day when they had that wonderful crispy outer layer and chewy inner layer i solved the problem with my second batch by baking only the number of cookies i wanted each day and storing the rest of the batter in the fridge voila freshbaked flavor every day next time ill try freezing some too and see if that works wellbe very carful not to overbake them one pan of mine came out quite brown on the bottoms not burnt though and they didnt taste good at all to me
5,every body around my office liked them
5,this is by far the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe i have ever made or eaten they are delicious and i will definitely continue to come back to this one thank you taste of home
5,this is my alltime favorite cookie recipe i have made it many times for a snack at home or to take to a gettogether always a hit among my friends i enjoy using a cup of chocolate chips and a cup of dried cranberries for a sweet chocolately flavor wonderful taste texture and small enough so that one or two cookies wont ruin your diet
5,best oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe ever the vanilla pudding adds a depth and richness chewy even the next day ive used regular cookandserve pudding and instant and it worked great using either my family cant stop eating these cookies
5,phenomenal recipe outstanding in every way texture tasteit is all wonderful
5,these were a definite winner in my house i left out the nuts and used butterscotch pudding very yummy
5,wow love these cookies they are soft and chewy and the flavor is fantastic i also added a cup of raisins and only had french vanilla instant pudding but it worked just as well i had to bake them for minutes but i may have made mine a little larger instead of butter i used smart balance these cookies could not have been better and i will make them again and again
5,so good and chewy i substituted the nuts for mampms be sure not to overcook though i also tried this with chocolate pudding and it was also really great
5,this recipe turned out great it took a while but was easy to make particularly for candy i look forward to taking them to my christmas party tomorrow since they both look and taste almost like reeses peanut butter cups i am glad that i realized that the recipe calls for teaspoons of butter not tablespoons
5,very easy though a little bit messy but they sure are good ive always been a reeses fan but they just lost a long time customer
5,these are so easy to make i put the chocolate in a freezer bag and cut off the tip it works great for putting the chocolate into the liners without making a mess i also double the filling for more peanut butter inside the candys
5,this is a good recipe very similar to mine i use paper candy cups so the candy doesnt stick
5,love this recipe but i melted the chocolate on my stove im not good with the microwave my husband absolutely loved these his opinion is theyre better than the ones you buy in the store this will be a staple in my cookie trays from now on
5,was a hit with everyone who tried them they are better than r
5,looks great havent made them yet but was wondering if natural peanut butter will work thats all i buy these days but would love to make these and dont want to ruin them thanks
5,we made these today with our daughter it was an excellent recipe
5,this is similar to a recipe i make i found the recipe years ago but i dont care for peanut butter so i simply use marshmallow cream and whip it up in the mixer and then continue with the recipe replacing the peanut butter with the marshmallow cream these make great mallow cups i keep the recipes ingredients around for when i get the taste for some chocolate i make them in a regular cupcake pan and then wrap and take them to church for others so i dont pig out on them
5,these are dangerous my family all agreed they tasted better than reeses peanut butter cups our favorite candy this recipe was easy to follow and perfect as written but i tried some variations i made them regular muffin sized and another time i substituted white candy melts for the regular chocolate coating make these at your own risk
5,these are excellent i double the peanut butter mixture and use regular cupcake paper and put a layer of chocolate down then a nice size dollop of the peanut butter mixture then more chocolate make sure the peanut butter doesnt go to the sides otherwise the chocolate wont seal around it all the way put them in the fridge until cooled then take scissors and cut the remaining paper above the chocolate off this will make the original size peanut butter cups these are so much better then the store bought ones and well worth the work
5,these were amazing easy to make and totally addicting love the mixture of the two chocolates taste like reeses peanut butter cups this is a definite keeper
5,these are so simple to make and taste fantastic love giving these as easter gifts i always double the recipe
5,i made these yesterday and they are delicious i made them with natural peanut butter truvia powdered sugar and sugar free chocolate they tasted just like a regular peanut butter cup they are very rich so the smaller size worked very well i got cups and just peanut butter filling because i ran out of chocolate but that was plenty will definitely make these again
5,i love them they are absolutely delicious my grandma just got out of surgery and she loves these treats it is all my families favorite ingredients i love how they made the pattern with chocolate and peanut butter making it taste even better
5,great recipe and easy to follow instructions ill be trying these soon my favorite
5,easy to make and just as tasty as the store bought candy
5,very good and easy to make
5,made a double batch today so easy and sooo good i added a tsp of mexican vanilla and omitted the salt i used a honey peanut butter these will be added to one of my favorites
5,i used only the filling ingredients plus t vanilla to fill some melted belgian milk chocolate disks in silicone molds dusted top with toasted crushed dryroasted peanuts using a sieve to keep the big chunks out results in a fluffy filling in chocolate these cups taste best when chilled before eating i liked the size better than the size i made prepared at saint paul college culinary arts school pastry class chef said russell stover move over when he tasted them for my proficiency grade
5,i added a couple ounces of cream cheeseyum smooth
5,my family and i followed this recipe and it was fantastic we used pipping bags and zip lock bags to put the chocolate and peanut butter into the mini cupcake cups this made it go very fast and easy we will be making these again
5,these are so easy to make and they are delicious i followed the recipe exactly
5,taste like the real thing

5,easy to make next time i will use less chocolate and more peanut butter
5,peanut butter cup barsokay so i tried making the cups prior and it was a mess and looked a mess the paper cups collapsed i couldnt get them to look perfectso this time i decided to make peanut cup bars for easter gifts thy look perfect so much easier to make and you lessen the risk of not using the chocolate in time for it going all dry and lumpyi bought candysweet clear bags i tripled the amount of mixture i used a non stick reusable sheet and lined an oven tray it covered almost half the tray the layers i used galaxy bars no cheap chocolate chips so much smoother a taste for the chocolate really adds to the taste from what ive been told and i added himalayan pink salt to the mixture of peanut buttermicrowaves are bad for you so i didnt use one i dont have one it changes the cellular structure of food and is harmful to dna i just used a stainless steel pot on the cooker filled with water on and a smaller one on there for the chocolate mix and the the peanut butter mixi did first layer put in freezer for mins then did the peanut layer easier to spread it when bottom layer is hard same in freezer mins then last layer of chocolate back in the freezer for mins then using a cleaver i cut it into big bars looks perfect and greati got pounds ounces worth of bars and big bars out of it much much easier to make these than to try make perfect cups anyone ive made these for prior absolutely lovesssssss the tasteso going to wrap in greaseproof paper then in yellow tissue paper inside the bag then put into the clear bags tie on yellow ribbons and glue a chick and an egg on ribbon and hand out for easter would be great fora photo upload function
5,yes these are the best my brothers loved them
5,easy to prepare and easy to eat i make these often for holiday treats and they can also be frozen these come out twice the size of regular reeses cups so yummy
5,easy peasy i made another batch so i was expecting to get peanut butter cups i ended up with dozen i had to melt some more chocolate maybe i wasnt using enough peanut butter mixture in each one at any rate they were a hit i cant eat them but my kids amp hubby said they were awesome
5,excellent change of sprinkles and mini liners make them perfect for any party they are a hit on any holiday tray
5,these are delicious made them for a christmas dinner party people requested the recipe only made them as miniature size cause they are rich i used a spoon to spread chocolate around sides of cups before dropping peanut butter the top chocolate is easier to spread to cover
5,ive been making these for years at valentines day theyre very cute putting the peanut butter in with the melted chocolate gives them a softer texture my daughter loves them they are a fun and inexpensive candy to make
5,very good
5,they are a family favorite at christmas easy to make also
5,these are very good and i make them every christmas as part of my candy cooking i use less salt and make one one quarter of the filling recipe
5,this turned out great and yielded exactly the quantity it stated with no leftover ingredients
5,yum so easy to make i didnt have the candy bars required so i just used all milk chocolate chips and they still came out delicious and cute
5,these are delicious i will definitely make these at christmas and valentines day from now on
5,omgoodness we are hooked my family loved these so much they said they should be illegal thanks for the great copycat receipts we love them
5,same way you make peanut butter bars
5,delicious i will make these again pleasewhat happened to our choices to print recipes
5,made these last evening after receiving the email took about an hour start to finish yummy easy amp look fabulous more delicious than reeses my valentines will love them just like i do
5,was so easy to make for my valentinesi added cup chopped fine salted peanutsto filling for the same texture as reeses and they are the bomb husband and son love them said better than reesesthank u
5,very good i had no trouble melting the chocolate mixture in the microwave i used half power and checked and stirredevery secondsno problem i did increase the powdered sugar to cup and rolled the mixture out into logs each inches and them scored them every inch and refrigerated them until firm then followed the directions for putting them together in the recipe putting the little chucks of peanut butter mixture in each cup instead of having to spoon it in i was really impressed that this recipe worked out perfectly with the quantities given and made the cups exactly ill use it again
5,i know i already posted a review but have some other helpful hints i used a teaspoon melon baller to scoop heaping spoon of melted chocolate into cups then a slightly smaller one for peanut butter then back to larger one for top chocolate also put your cups on a tray covered in foil or pretty paper then you can refrigerate and serve on same tray i dont think it was messy at all and when i melted chocolate and peanut butter i put pb on bottom glass dish then choc melted about secs stirred then another secs wonderful and very easy
5,i have a son who is allergic to peanut butter before he became allergic he enjoyed peanut butter cups hasnt had one in years so for valentines day i decided to substitute soy butter for the peanut butter in this recipe and it turned out awesome you really cant tell the difference and he got to enjoy a long lost treat i did prepare the soy butter filling ahead but only added an extra c conf sugar because the soy butter is a little dryer than peanut butter and didnt want filling to crumble think next time i will add some crushed up pretzels to this and enjoy great tastes together excellent alternative for people allergic to peanuts
5,these treats were so easy and delicious the recipe is simple to follow and the peanut butter cups look professional i made them for valentines day and my family keeps asking for them again
5,yum time consuming but worth it
5,love it husband begs me to make this over and over again
5,well i did something completely different i made peanut butter eggs took a deviled eggmold amp made a chocolate shell filled with peanut butter mixture amp omg they rocked much much better than a reeses cup xoxoxox sue
5,these were a hit at potlucks very easy to make and can be poured into themed silicone molds for different occasions did not modify the recipe at all
5,can be easily poured into silicone molds skip the cups and its much less time consuming these were a hit did not modify the recipe at all
5,these were delicious and pretty simple the filling is so tasty by itself just like reeses the hardest part was finding the right chocolate to peanut butter ratio mine did melt really easily in my hand but that is my only complaint
5,i have made these a couple of times now my family loves them just as much as reeses i no longer take the time to make individual cups i spread half the chocolate mixture in a bar pan lined with wax paper sling chill the bar pan until the chocolate is set enough to spread on the peanut butter mixture spread on the remaining chocolate it may have to be reheated then cut into pieces
5,i have made these peanut butter cups quite a few times i really enjoy them they taste better without the sprinkles but this is a personal preference i make them at christmas
5,loved this recipe made for valentines day easy and yummy
5,i like peanut butter cups but was amazed at how good these really taste they taste better in my opinion than the name brand and my yr old daughter had a blast helping me make them as well as putting her own sprinkles on top i would definitely make again

5,very tasty try increasing confectioners sugar to a scant cups knead with hands as it is much drier in texture roll into one or two logs slightly smaller in diamiter than the paper cups you are using chill cut into rounds follow directions for filling paper minature muffin cups much faster and easier
5,made these in both small amp larger sizes at christmas they were quick amp easy amp the best peanut butter cups family loved them
5,so easy and delicious everyone loved them at work
5,everyone loved these i did alter them slightly instead of using cup pb with the chocolate i used tbs oil it made the chocolate very rich and creamy i also needed extra powdered sugar to get the pb to hold together and added a splash of vanilla as an afterthought a great basic and quick recipe that can be altered to fir your tastebuds
5,these were pretty easy to make with absolutely todiefor results and they look pretty too my husband and i loved them i did run out of chocolate at about dozen but next time and there will definitely be a next time i will be more careful with spooning out the chocolate yummm
5,delicious this recipe is a winner to my family and i very easy and fun

5,very good recipe just make sue you use a deep dish skillet to stir everything i usually use a bag of frozen mixed vegetables have made it several times and it always a hit
5,goodeasy recipe for all u snarky bullies who feel the need to comment that its not technically shepherds pie please get over yourselves many recipes that refer to themselves as spaghetti sauce or enchiladas are not necessarily authentic but rather americanized versions of delicious dishes smh
5,this looks good i tend to makes same dishes for a long time its time for some different meals especially ones that are easy to copy i can change it as i see fit and thank whoever wrote it for sharing
5,i found this to be very tasty and easy to make for those who find ads are covering part of the recipe try a different browser the ads im seeing are below andor to the right of the recipe ingredients and comments
5,delicious amp easy
5,i was worried there wasnt going to be enough flavor with the ingredients measured as written i was wrong this is a wonderful dish made as originally listed will make again was almost better as leftovers
5,this recipe is wonderful as written its been on my rotation for months i also switch it up using sausage and whatever veggies i have in the freezer its easy tasty and satisfyingly filling stars
5,this is easy to prepare and very tasty i doubled the recipe and fixed it in a dutch oven it one of my sons favorites
5,really enjoyed this the whole family even the picky eaters ate it up i liked that it was not labor intensive for such a flavorful meal
5,the whole family really enjoyed this i liked that it was easy to make on a weeknight i used a cast iron skilled and then put it in the oven to heat with foil over it then broiled the cheese for the last minutes
5,everyone loved this i love how quick it was to make so easy if you use the prepackaged containers of mashed potatoes i used canned veggies and one beef bouillon cube the sour cream was a nice touch
5,love the recipe i divide it in half a make two dinners one now and one to freeze or give away
5,excellent recipe it is versatile and i made a few tweaks for our familys taste but everyone enjoyed it and will be making it again
5,i made this last week and it was very good the sour cream adds richness to the dish i added salt and pepper to taste and used white cheddar cheese im allergic to annatto the food dye used to color many yellow cheeses and other foods my husband loved this dish so i will be making it again
5,while this is a yummy recipe its actually not a sheppards pie sheppards pie is made with ground lamb what you have made it a cross between a cumberland pie beef and breadcrumbs on top and a canadian pâté chinois beef
5,this dish was phenomenal hubby and i both loved it the only change that i made was using tomato paste rather than ketchup which was a kitchen tip i also put the tomato paste before the peas and corn to let it cook out and develop flavor then worcestershire sauce and garlic stirring to incorporate before adding the vegetables i also divided in half topped one with our cheddar mashed and cheese and froze the other just the meat mixture so when we are ready to eat we just need to top with potatoes and cheese
5,this is my all time favourite recipe i actually make it with gardein vegetarian ground beef and use vegetable broth instead of beef broth as im vegetarian and its soooooooooo good my meat loving husband and stepson request this meal all the time lt
5,a family favorite i make several times
5,long back my aunt made a shepherds pieguess that was some or years backnever had shepherds pie since thenloved it then and am happy that i was reminded of those days and lovely recipeyummythanks
5,i made this a couple of weeks ago and my family enjoyed it so much they asked me to make it again so i made it tonight i didnt add the sour cream because my husband doesnt like it i didnt have any more worchester sauce left so i substituted a sauce also i used canned mixed vegetables which i drained and washed to get rid of salt still delicious winner
5,my mother used to make this but she would pour the mixture into a baking dish before adding the mashed potato topping then she would bake it in the oven for minutes at degrees fahrenheit it was a wonderful meal on a cold winter evening
5,delicious recipe fyi chicken or beef bouillon granules can be found in the soup aisle herbox is the only kind i have seen comes in a small jar
5,we got snowed in so i made this it is so easy
5,this recipe is cottage pie not shepherds pie shepherds pie uses lamb my tweeks i did not use corn or sour cream i baked it in the oven after putting it all together i used peas and carrots and mashed cauliflower it was superb i made it again with ground turkey
5,this recipe was super easy to make and my whole family loved it including my picky and year old girls glad i found this will definitely add to my rotation of meals i typically have all these ingredients on hand
5,this is definately a new family favorite my kids loved this as much as i did not to mention my picky husband

5,delicious lots of flavor very quick and easy i boiled the chicken in broth with the garlic and onion shredded it then added it back in with the rest of the ingredients mashed some of the beans also added some cream cheese a handful of jack cheese and thickened it with some corn starch
5,delicious lots of flavor very quick and easy i boiled the chicken in broth with the garlic and onion shredded it then added it back in with the rest of the ingredients mashed some of the beans also added some cream cheese a handful of jack cheese and thickened it with some corn starch
5,why do people get so hung up on recipe titles ridiculous
5,after helpings of this dish my husband said i could add this dish to our weekly dinner rotation i added chopped carrots instead of the corn along with a teaspoon as thyme and it was delicious definitely a keeper
5,this shepherds pie has a wonderful taste to it it comes together quickly i substituted canned green beans amp corn for the frozen because that is what i had on hand will definitely be making this again
5,this is easy to make and has good flavor i added tsp of salt and tsp of black pepper to the meat and onion mixture based on what others had said i didnt have any sour cream and i used canned corn instead of frozen and topped the potatoes with white cheddar my husband gave it a thumbs up
5,if i want comfort food and i want dinner this is the perfect recipe very easy to make all though ill admit i left out the worcestershire sauce and added in a few other spices instead butt hats just personal preference
5,i dont care what its called we call it darned good very comforting dinner and easy to prepare
5,ive been making this since high school in the s and always used hamburger meat so the ingredient to use typically depends on which contry your from in the us is typically beefsee from wikipedia in early cookery books the dish was a means of using leftover roasted meat of any kind and the pie dish was lined with mashed potato as well as having a mashed potato crust on topthe term shepherds pie did not appear until and since then it is sometimes used synonymously with cottage pie regardless of whether the principal ingredient is beef or mutton in the united kingdom the term shepherds pie is typically used when the meat is lamb
5,this was a very easy recipe it tasted great i did leave out the peas other than that i made ether same recipe
5,this is excellent i added a chicken bullion cube as well i am eating the leftovers for lunch and reheated beautifully i will make this again janet vfe
5,everyone loved this dish i made it super easy by using frozen chopped onions and instant potatoes but after reading some of the comments i can see its a very vestal recipe
5,this was really good i did add extra seasoning garlic powder onion powder salt and pepper
5,really great simple recipe like others have mention it needs more seasoning but i usually change seasoning to most recipes so not an issue for me
5,this is an exceptional shepherds pie the sour cream just adds a special richness and flavor almost like a stroganoff never would i have ever thought to add sour cream to shepherds pie filling i add fresh thyme leaves to taste and as usual swap out the worcestershire for steak sauce no anchovies for me as far as the veggies go i always use whatever i feel like even brussels sprouts once i add a couple of bay leaves and fresh ground black pepper to my potato water when boiling and then when i mash them i add a packet of onion soup mix butter and heavy cream are a must
5,this turned out well and was quite easy we dont like peas much so i added some finely chopped carrots and mushrooms and used tomato paste rather than ketchup nice dinner for a cold day
5,excellent and easy
5,i havent tried this but im giving it stars for the idea alone it sounds amazing thanksi dont use bullion but will use beef broth in place of water cant wait till the leftover turkey is all gone to try this
5,excellent my husband ate all the leftoversso ill be making this again and again
5,im giving this five stars tho i did have to make some substitutions based on what i had on hand i used some leftover beef roast about bag of frozen mixed veg medley almost a whole jar of turkey gravy with some generous splashes of worcestershire sauce some leftover mash and some crunched up tater tots to make up for my small amount of mash i layered on some processed cheese you know the kind that comes in a loaf and just left it to bubble away my husband declared it some really good comfort food which was perfect after the crummy rainy day we had so please forgive me reviewer purists out there for everyone else ill just say this recipe is very forgiving its hard to go too wrong with a combo of beef veggies and potatoes especially when you only have to wash one pan oh and i didnt add the sour cream because i knew with only the two of us there would be leftovers and i didnt know how that would hold up
5,this gets stars because both of my picky eater daughters loved itone meal and two kids liking itwow that rarely happens personally i needed to add some salt and pepper on my plate thank you for this great tweenfriendly recipe
5,this was excellent had everything in my pantry except peas so i used green beans instead hubs said this is a keeper quick and easy
5,this is very different from the traditional shepherds pie recipe that i usually make and we enjoy so i wasnt sure about this recipe that has so many vegetables sour cream ketchup etc i decided to give it a try based on the many positive comments and i am glad i did i followed the recipe pretty closely but added a bit more seasoning as others suggested and broiled it the last couple minutes delicious i will definitely make this again
5,my family loved this recipe i added carrots rather than the peas i also added tony chacheres seasoning to the hamburger mixture and paprika sprinkled on the mashed potatoes excellent
5,jim and dee likes better then other recipes that were tried
5,was a real hit with my family i used carrots and beans from our garden in place of corn amp peas and baked in the oven because my skillet wasnt big enough im a volunteer field editor and enjoy testing out recipes we loved the flavours in this dish
5,omg this is really good and quick love being able to make it all in one skillet i changed a few things up i used beef stock instead of water added some carrots too i used instant mashed taters and doctored them up with butter stars
5,made this last night pretty much as it says i used plain yogurt instead of sour creamturned out really good nice flavour i will be making this again especially in the summer when you dont want to turn your oven on but you need a hot meal
5,omg i have tried various recipes for shepherds pie it never came out to be very tasteful this recipe is by far the best this is the way i will forever make it now i changed it up just a little bitused canned corn instead no peas because i dont like them
5,this was quick and easy i also didnt realize the vegis had to be thawed and threw them in frozen still came out great everyone loved it i will definitely be making this again
5,i just made this as a matter of fact i have my empty bowl sitting in front of me still more on the stove well anyway i made the mashed potatoes from instant i could have easily doubled the amount called for in the recipe probably not if you use real potatoes i used canned veggies to skip the thawing any way you make this dish it will turn out great gotta go seconds are calling my name
5,easy to fix and delicious it freezes well and my son often takes a container to his home for dinner he enjoys shopping for dinner via the freezer use beef froth rather than water and cube which is convenient very satisfying dinner thank you for teaching an old dog a few new tricks
5,good and made with things you would normally have on hand
5,this is a great and easy recipe my husband has me freeze what is left so when he gets the urge defrost and heat does this well
5,really enjoyed this recipeand my family loved it thanks for sharing leeann treacher
5,the best thing is the flavor the second best thing is how fast it is to make i like how the minimal cooking allowed the frozen vegetables to keep their integrity and flavor i used mixed vegetables instead of corn and peas only i also upped the ketchup w sauce and beef bullion granules by half again as much to give it an extra punch of flavor a keeper
5,excellent flavors i made this in advance covered with foil refrigerated until time for dinner warmed up at for minutes uncovered continued warming for more minutes i will allow a little longer to warm up next time but it is still delicious i think the ketchup gives it just a hint of sweetness my hubby loved it and so did i
5,love love love it very easy and i had all ingredients for it kids ate it up with minimal talking at the dinner table a sure sign they enjoyed it anything with ketchup and worcestershire sauce is a hit
5,i made this tonight for my mom she loved it whenever she says its a star keeper i know she loves it she even asked for seconds which is most unusual because i didnt have any leftover mashed potatoes i prepared a full bag of oreida steam and mash russet potatoes i used packets of lowsodium beef broth because shes on a lowsodium diet i used a tad less worcester sauce and increased the amount of lowsodium ketchup but the flavor was still great oh btw i loved it too we will definitely have this again
5,excellent and easy
5,oh my goodness this was sooo delicious it came together really fast even including the time it took to make the mashed potatoes i did make double the water bullion cornstarch mixture and was heavy handed with the worcestershire because i like the filling saucy and it turned out fabulous my new favorite shepherds pie recipe
5,if you add an egg to the potatoes they wil get crispy golden brown on the top french fries onion rings during the last minutes yummy

5,this was a very easy and great tasting recipe i didnt have frozen vegetables so i used canned corn and green beans it turned out great i like it even better the next day
5,ive made this recipe so many times that ive lost track the only thing i do different is i use vegetable or beef stock instead of the boullion and boiling water this one is one of my favorite gotos
5,i followed the recipe
5,made this for dinner last night and we both loved it i did dress it up a little by adding an egg combined with about oz of ricotta then mixed half the mozz into this spread this mixture on top of each layer before adding final layer of sauce mozz and about cup of parm left the ravioli frozen and used the jarred sauce that starts with r and ends with s dish came out perfect not watery at all i like that it was enough for dinner one night and lunch another day will definitely make this again
5,this was fantastic i used one pound of ground beef and one pound of spicy italian sausage and added some italian seasoning amp garlic salt to the meat mixture two jars of newmans marinara sauce and two bags of small round cheese raviolis for the first layer of cheese i followed the suggestion of another reviewer and mixed ricotta an egg basil and i added parmesan and mozzarella to the mix i used a x glass pan baked it about minutes then took the foil off and baked it another minutes we had guests for dinner and everyone loved it

5,have made it many times for company use my own sauce and a certain brand of ravioli from publix called parla these ravioli taste like homemade no garbage ingredients and make a big difference in the outcome of your meal

5,i made this over years ago for my kids i would put the ravioli in individual ramekins and freeze when they got home from school just take a ramekin from the freezer and bake great little pickpickmeup before after school activities began this is also good with cheese ravioli leftover chicken and alfredo sauce
5,home run i took the advice of previous reviews to increase the amount of cheese and meat i also followed the advice to use italian sausage instead of ground beef more flavor next time i would also increase the amount of raviolii used a chickenspinach ravioli i think a person could put a latin spin on the recipe and use salsa instead of spaghetti sauce
5,i made this very easytomake recipe for dinner last night it was delicious the only thing i changed was to add a ounce can of petite diced tomatoes to the spaghetti sauce because i like my lasagne to be saucy also i used a xinch glass baking dish which worked well if youre looking for a quick and easy and hearty meal this is the recipe for you stars volunteer field editor
5,very easy and satisfying
5,excellent and so easy i did use some little half moon shaped raviolis that have a lot more cheese in them than your standard frozen ravioli but that is the only thing i did differently i mightve added a little extra mozzarella cheese to but that didnt change the fact that this is a wonderful and very satisfying dish i am planning to make this for christmas eve dinner yum yum
5,we enjoyed this recipe tonight i made no changes except to make a smaller amount for the two of us it is delicious and we cleaned our plates quick easy and delicious volunteer field editor

5,pa favorite of my hubby he loves the flavor of this one and so do ip

5,i absolutely love this recipe my family requests it all the time i even make it as a soup without the beans because its good either way
5,amazingly good going to test it out with lowfat sour cream next time i couldnt find chopped chillies so i used salsa verde instead really really good i might replace my old red chili recipe with this

5,this was wonderful my husband and i loved it so much weve decided to make it for the family for the holiday my husband also thinks i should enter this in the chili cookoff at our campground becuase he thinks it would win he was a judge last year and said this was better than any chili he tasted
5,i went out on a limb with this one because the guys in my family are all about the red chili and dont like to try something new when planning menu for next week the white chili was first on their list
5,great recipe easy to put together and flavor was wonderful will make again
5,will definitely make again i used sausage ravioli and spaghetti sauce with garlic wonderful flavor and so easy delicious
5,i have to say that i really liked this ravioli lasagna i used cheese and spinach ravioli and added my typical italian spices to the sauce oniongreen peppergarlicmushrooms with the browning ground beef because i wanted to make certain that it wouldnt be dry i made times the sauce it was so much easier than the typical lasagna but again it isnt the typical lasagna i will still make classic lasagna it has its own attributes
5,super easy and delicious
5,i made this dish tonight for dinner and it was a hit i used mild italian sausage instead of ground beef used sharp cheddar and parmesan cheese and beef ravioli i also added onion and garlic to the sauce this will be a dish we have once a month for dinner love it
5,made this and its fabulous now i need to double the recipe has anybody doubled it if so what size casserole did you use plus how long did you need to bake it or would you recommend make two casseroles thank you

5,so easy and sooooooo good
5,i have no idea how a recipe with so few ingredients tastes so good and its so easy too absolutely delicious i used an italian sausage ravioli to give it a little extra kick
5,this recipe is so inspiring and easy you dont even need to boil the ravioli just bake as the recipe directs i make my own sauce but any favorite will do try pepperoni and prepared pizza sauce for a meal the kids will love its one of those quick cant fail everyone loves recipes
5,great idea im glad i tried it my modification i used different types of ravioli flavors from trader joes for each layer one layer cheese and spinach ravioli then sauce and cheese next layer mushroom and cheese ravioli sauce and cheese etc i used about different types all vegetarian for my son and family loved it for the meat eaters i poured tj s turkey bolognese sauce and sprinkled parmesan cheese over the top of individual portion before serving
5,this was so good i used a olive oil and garlic sauce and italian sausage these gave it all the flavor it needed i used the cheese raviolis which i think would be what this dish needs we just couldnt stop eating it this is going to be on my table a lot thank you for this wonderful recipe
5,super easy and really tasty i used pepperoni instead of beef easy to adapt with different meat and different ravioli fillings this will be a regular
5,this dish is easy and quick to assemble my family loved it and it makes enough to feed six of us this includes hungry teenagers its nice to use frozen ravioli since you can have a couple of bags stashed in freezer at all times thanks for sharing
5,quick easy and good will try adding some sausage next time great recipe
5,this is a great weeknight dinner that is quick easy when you keep everything on hand to make it freezes great too
5,i love how easy and delicious this meal was i used a mix of sausage and beef and jar sauce however i used a jar and a half of sauce i love how versatile this dish is if i had my homemade sauce or meat sauce on hand i would use that i think it would also be good with chicken
5,i was skeptical anything this easy would be good but tried it as an option to freeze and send to my grad school son i made as directed except since i cook a lot and had much on hand i added garlic and onion powder worcestershire sugar fresh basil and oregano to the sauce as i had that on hand really whatever you do to jarred sauce or nothing would work i used cheese ravioli and lean ground beaf i also threw in about cup of parmesan with the mozzarella because i had it this was really good for what could be a ingredient recipethis could be adapted so many ways but it is surprisingly good for such a simple recipe
5,this recipe is a winner is so easy delicious and lends itself to customize to your familys taste i added the meat with the sauce and also some chopped red pepper onion and italian seasoning i used cheese ravioli i used about jars of sauce because we like our pasta pretty saucy and the picture did not seem to be but i dont think it was actually necessary i will make this again and again and tweak the recipe according to what i have on hand and who i am serving
5,perfect recipe for busy week night delicious and easy describes this dish
5,this recipe was really good i wouldnt change a thing although if i wished i could add a little more spice real easy to make
5,awesome recipe delicious and definitely a keeper
5,admission i didnt use any meat when i made my version but it was really good and well received with my picky eaters i used cheese ravioli and it was saucier than im sure it would have been with meat but it was delish super quick and easy to put together will def make again
5,this was very good definitely make this again the only modification i made to the recipe was i used a small amount of ground beef
5,ive also made this using pierogies layering them like lasagna noodles you can even make this meatless for a lenten meal
5,boiled ravioli first and reduced baking time to mins swapped ground italian sausage for ground beef added a pinch of brown sugar and t italian seasoning to sauce would be great to double and freeze
5,easy to put together tastes like it took you forever it was a great crowd pleaser
5,this was easy to make while on vacation didnt take any pantry ingredients which was great since we stayed in a place that had nothing but the pans provided it was enjoyed by everyone
5,botanner first if youre going to review a recipe that you havent tried have the decency to give it four or five stars so it doesnt lower the overall rating second just about all italian recipes can be high in sodium so whats your point third incredible amount of salt there are cheese ravioli brands that arent high in sodium per serving ditto for spaghetti sauce or make your own sauce i have to watch my sodium but ill make this dish maybe with adjustments maybe not
5,i agree with southern master seems like lately a lot of people who havent made the recipes are just using the recipes as soap boxes to trash the salt content and not rate the recipe go to low or no salt recipe websites and let the people who want to try the recipes do it
5,absolutely fantastic this recipe is so versatile that can be altered with different ingredients according to ones liking i made it for dinner last night amp my husband kept on raving about it here are my changes used ground turkey dietary restrictions instead of beef portobello mushroom ravioli amp low fat shredded italian blend cheese little romano cheese tuscan herb mixture cooked the ground turkey then added the pasta sauce to it in the same pot followed the recipe from there amp sprinkled tablespoons of grated romano cheese on top i made this yesterday morning and left it in the fridge brought it to room temp hours before baking frankly i rather make this than lasagna since its easier lighter amp tastier patricia thank you so much for sharing your wonderful recipe this is a keeper in my recipe file

5,we have people in our family and there is always one that complains every night about what we eat for supper but not tonight the family absolutely loved this i tweeked the recipe a little bit i used a bigger pan and i used one whole jar of sauce on the bottom then layered the frozen bag of ravioli on top off sauce and pushed down into the sauce then layered the hamburger on ravioli poured another jar of sauce all over the layers used the whole cup bag of cheese plus a little bit more which made a nice layer over everything to top it off i covered the shredded cheese with single layer of pepperoni cooked minutes at and served before supper was over everyone wanted to know when we could have this meal again

5,this was great used rotisserie chicken from the grocery store though will definitely make again adding a little more cayenne next time
5,smells as amazing as it tastes
5,my husband loved this i made it with the sausage instead of hamburger and he just raved about it he asked when are we having that again thank you very much
5,this is very good and extremely simple i added garlic powder to the beef and used the cheese ravioli it was delicious the second time i made this i did a mixture of beef and italian sausage and the cheese ravioli with extra cheese and it was fantastic the third time i tried the recipe with the sausage ravioli but i think you need the cheese ravioli to accomplish the lasagna tasteeffect we did not like that one nearly as much
5,quick and so good i kicked it up a notch starting with a meat sauce then the cheese ravioli topped with land of lakes new cheese blend american style slices grated mozzarela saucea layer of italian sausage crumbled and cooked sprinkled with italian seasoning then a layer of beef ravioli topped with the same cheese layeres as above then another layer of cheese raviloianother layer of sauce grated parm then more italian cheese blend i also added a extra cup of water to the sauce to ensure that the pasta cooks well it really doesnt look like it is too thin of a sauce but it does hlp this filled my lasagna pan which is larger than a x feeds an army i put this together the day before i wanted it and took it out of the fridge about an hour before putting it in my degree oven i covered it for the first mins with foil sprayed with pam olive oil uncovered it and let it brown a little please let it sit for mins or so to set up manga manga
5,oops plus stars
5,i honestly didnt think something this easy could turn out so ridiculously rich and delicious its cheesy indulgent gooey comfort food taken to the tenth poweri made two pans one using italian sausage that i seasoned with onions and italian spices for a carnivore friend and a meatless version for myself both were wonderful and garnered big thumbs up thanks to the other reviewers for suggesting sausage instead of beef it really added richness to the dishother minor changes i used two types of ravioli cheese and portabellacheese i used one jar of marinara and one jar of vodka sauce and a shredded blend of mozzarella parmesan and romanoas far as steps i followed them exactly and it was easy as pie and as tasty i couldnt believe how great both pans looked when i pulled them out of the oven or how good the kitchen smelled a keeper for sure
5,i have made this several times in the past few months since i first spotted this recipe online i have jazzed it up a bit since i first tried it the first time i made it strictly by the bookned while it was good i felt like it was lacking something taking my own cue for the traditional lasagna i typically make the next time i made this i added some chopped onion and baby portabella mushrooms and i used one package of ground beef plus i added one pound of bulk italian sausage once thry were all cooked together i layered the ravioli cheese only the sauce the mozarela cheese plus i also added a package of provolone cheese slices divided and i topped twitch one half a jar of alfredo sauce i then repeated the ayers endings with the red sauce and cheese and baked as directed it is a lot easier than putting the traditional lasagna recipe together i have served this to several friends and they all love it thanks for posting the original recipe which has since morphed into my new favorite lasagna recipe
5,i thought this was very good and tasted much like the more hard to prepare lasagna i added italian seasoning to the ground turkey and added sliced provolone cheese in between the ravioli layers with italian mix cheese on top my husband and son were less excited about it than i was but i thought that was because they dont do the cooking and so they dont know the time and effort that goes into making real lasagna
5,when i found this recipe i knew i had to make it now i did switch it up a little bit using italian sausage instead of hamburger also didnt have the spaghetti sauce that i needed to make it but to make what the recipe called for i used alfredo sauce an substituted the cheese for a mix of provel and mozzarella cheese this made it very creamy and had extra sause for it which is what i like overall very good recipe and i will definately be making this again
5,this is so easy to make and my family just loved it terri ann

5,very tasty and easy to make i added bay leaves in it after adding the can of cream of chicken soup and simmered it for minutes while my buns cooked
5,i have used recipes on taste of home for years and never left a review before now this soup is amazing i made it exactly as written and my large family loved it i used leftover grilled chicken ff sour cream and lowfat cream of chicken soup absolutely amazing will make againand againand again i may add sauted onion and celery next time but it was wonderful as is
5,i recently made this soup for my neighbors who were ill it couldnt have been easier the creamy goodness made both of our households very happy i added carrots and celery to the soup to up the nutritional value and make for a heartier meal this is going on our regular rotations of soups this winter
5,this recipe is quick easy and oh so delicious everyone i have made it for has loved it
5,great soup we will definitely be making this again
5,im a souper foodie they call me the soup queen i woke up at am cst and was browsing instagram why because why not theres a plethora of fun stuff to learn i came across this recipe and it was just what my soul was after i read the list of ingredients and low and behold i had everything can i get a whoop whoop i used cream of celery soup because i like the layer of flavor it adds i too added c diced celery and shredded carrots i didnt have sour cream who ate my sour cream but i did have block cream cheese oh yeah you heard me right itll be ready shortly im drooling thanks so much for posting this recipe souped easy and delicious
5,made this tonight so deliciousjust added some carrots yummy
5,you will not regret making this soup i made this one saturday morning while my son slept off a fever i figured it would be just what he needed when he woke up i only made half a batch and i immediately regretted my decision like some other reviewers i sautéed carrot onion and garlic in olive oil then removed from the stock pot and started the recipe as written i also substituted chicken broth for the water and bouillon added the carrot mixture when i added the chicken and added some salt and pepper it was delicious and definitely a comfort food during an arctic plunge in our region my son snarfed it down when he got up i will be adding this to my goto recipe collection very good
5,i recently made this following the instructions the soup was creamy thick and full of chicken flavor for the two of us this made enough for a nice dinner and with the left over lunch for a another day or two after reading other variations on this recipe i will be trying them as well this is an easy soup and with substance for the person who needs more than just soup
5,this is my absolute favorite chicken noodle soup and ever since i made it a couple years ago ive never made another chicken soup recipe this one is too good to pass up i do add some onions celery and carrots because i like the veggies in the soup so much and i prefer to add a big spoonful of sour crean to each serving in the bowl rather than adding it to the pot that way when i heat up the leftovers the sour cream wont break this is just beyond delicious and super easy too
5,this is a really good soup before i added the sour cream at the end i tasted it its good to eat with or without the addition of the sour cream homemade cream of chicken soup was used to replace the canned version in my soup
5,this soup turned out great i added carrots celery onion peas minced garlic basil dried parsley flakes and cheese taste wonderful
5,i ended up using rotisserie chicken and cooked it in an instant pot with a little onion powder and ounces of frozen mixed vegetables it turned out terrific and even my picky children liked the soup i will say that it needs to be cooked in a larger instant pot as it ran over in my quart instant pot minutes with instant release i put the sour cream in at the end before serving but i will make this again
5,we love this soup the only change ive made is using chicken broth rather than bouillon i frequently increase the liquid ingredients and add mixed vegetables either way its delicious
5,caught chicken on sale so i made this for lunch today it was creamy and delicious and so easy to make instead of the bouillon i used the broth i boiled my chicken in
5,i just made it absolutely delicious
5,excellent definitely will make this again
5,this is exactly the same recipe that my husbands grandma used apparently it was a special halloween aftertrickortreat meal served over mashed potatoes i love it on its own and we make it a lot more frequently than once a year its my favorite chicken noodle soup recipe weve also subbed turkey or rabbit in for the chicken and its just as delicious weve also added other vegetables like onions carrots and peas but the base recipe is still fantastic all on its own
5,this was super easy to make and it tasted great the recipe makes a lot so id recommend halting it unless you have a large family
5,this was so easy and everyone thought it was fantastic i did change a few things instead of water and chicken bouillon i added oz boxes of organic chicken broth i also sauteed diced onion carrots celery and garlic and used rotisserie chicken i did not add the sour cream either we will be making this again
5,love love love this recipe i do sauté my chicken remove from pan sauté garlic onion for about minute then add celery and carrots until tender then i follow the recipe exactly after that well i guess sometimes i add a little more water depending on my mood and sometimes i add more noodles and serve it over mashed potatoes regardless such a great recipe
5,this soup was so good so rich and creamy a quick meal that gives an all day comfort food feel we were licking our bowls clean
5,love this have made it several times can change yt toe of soup used and add in some veggies we love it
5,sounds great to me to the reviewers who questioned the amount of waterremember a teaspoon of bouillon to cup of water then you also have cans of soup seems like some people may want more water not less looking forward to always making same as recipe
5,every time i makes this soup everyone wants some its easy to make and tastewonderful
5,i halved the recipe and added diced onions celery and carrots i used a box of chicken broth instead of bullion it is delicious
5,smells as amazing as it tastes
5,awesome omitted salt and used reduced sodium chicken broth light sour cream and fat free half amp half even with these adjustments the chili was excellent will be making this again very soon easy quick

5,delicious and easy my family all loved it
5,i thought the soup was delicious i dont usually make a cream based soup for chicken noodle but the sour cream was a great addition i also thought cups of noodles were too many i used a full four cups and it was still a lot of noodles i only added one can of soup just didnt think it needed two sprinkled a little more bouillon in it added three carrots a couple of stalks of celery and about a cup of chopped kale for color and because i have lots in my garden i also just cooked my cubed chicken and vegetables in the broth a few minutes before i added the noodles
5,love this soup i am teaching my son to cook and he said he wanted to make a chicken noodle soup i picked this for its simplicity it was great next time i will add some veggies but this was a perfect soup to teach an eight year old to cook
5,ive made this several timesand have been told its the best chicken soup theyve ever had i dont even bother with the sour cream its tasty without it i do saut celery and onions and use chicken broth instead of the bouillon and always use rotisserie chicken its excellent yes the noodles soak up the liquid so you may want to add a little broth if you like it soupierotherwise its sooooo good thank you for posting its an easy and quick dinner and i love that people rave about it
5,my husband who claims not to like chicken soup had seconds that iis not bad i was glad to get something so easily likeable and easy to tailor
5,this gets five stars for ease of preparation and common ingredients it has been a staple in our home for yearsever since it was first published i often add a can or two of chopped green chiles to give it a little oomph it is comfort food of the highest order
5,my family really enjoyed this soup it is so easy to prepare next time i will add fewer noodles and throw in some carrots and celery
5,outstanding
5,so glad we tried this recipethe flavor is so yummy and comforting we added the sour cream as well as a dash of garlic powder and some minced onions we used precooked presliced chicken strips to make the dish even faster i would like to add sliced celery carrots and onions and will next time a great dish especially during the colder months thanks for posting
5,so so good
5,this is a family favorite its sooo good everytime

5,easy creamy and yummy
5,very good the only thing i did different was use my homeade chicken broth instead of the water and boullion it turned out great
5,great soup if you want to call it a soupmakes a hold meal i thinki did use home made chicken broth instead of the chicken bouillon to reduce sodiumeveryone loved it
5,i made this today and thought it was just okay untill i added the sour cream then it was really good next time i will saute some celery onions and carrots and add them when i add the chicken yummy
5,my family loves this recipe i follow it as written i once made this for when my collegeage daughter caught influence a and was so sick this soup is definitely comfortingit made her feel better
5,yummy flavor i modified the recipe by adding fresh carrots and celery i also made homemade noodles made soup the day before didnt add noodles until the next day very yummy comfort food
5,i am eating this right now and it is so yummy the perfect soup for a snowy day i halved the recipe but i like my soup with more broth so i used six cups water and six tsps bouillon mmmmm
5,this is so easy my kids loved it it was even good leftover the noodles didnt get soggy in the creamy soup like they do in broth
5,even better than i expected and so easy to make
5,my friend made this soup for us for dinner and i loved it but it is not really a soup its more like a dinner but i loved this recipe stars
5,quick easy and amazing when i make it though it is less like a soup and more like a stroganoff but it is still so good
5,wonderful soupfills you up and the family love this recipe keep up the good work
5,great recipe wonderful comforting taste in a couple of the comments that i read it was said that this was more like a stroganoff than a soup the solution is just use less noodles i only used cups
5,i forgot to add that we preferred it with the lowfat cream of chicken soup after trying both the regular soup version was too thick and rich i normally do not prefer lowfat anything either
5,so easy and good i always add celery carrots onion and garlic and last time i threw in some peas too i use the sour cream if i have it on hand but we dont miss it when i dont have it
5,i use campbells cream of chicken amp herbs really makes a difference so good
5,aside from adding carrots and celery stuck straight to the recipe sooo delicious whole family enjoyed it
5,this has become a staple in our house for the past few years everyone loves it
5,made this recipe for my mom for mothers day actually the first meal ive cooked for her in my new home yay my whole family had seconds i forgot the sour cream yeah thats what i get for trying to do too many things at once but it still turned out delicious i might add a little more liquid next time though as i thought it was a little thick although maybe the sour cream might have helped that definitely making again
5,delicious we bulked it up by adding onion garlic carrots celery mushrooms and corn we used curly noodles and fresh ground pepper to top it off perfect i think if making it for others though i would stick with the basic recipe cant go wrong that way
5,really easy really good
5,this was so easy to make and has a wonderful flavor thank you for the idea great when you are sick craving chicken noodle soup it definitely beats regular canned soup delicious
5,i add fresh spinach and grated carrots and fresh black pepper excellent soup
5,wow this was super creamy and tasty i too added some onion carrot and celery as well as cut back drastically on the sour cream i also added more broth and used medium egg noodles just because it was preference even with those changes the recipe as written would still be just as good im pretty sure ill keep this recipe instead of my previous one give this one a try you wont be disappointed
5,this recipe earned a high recommendation into our familys list of favorite foods only we call it comfy chicken soupmy adult daughters now make this too we like this recipe less liquidy
5,this is so quick easyamp good i use can chicken most of the time and it still is great
5,this recipe was super easy i see that as a theme i followed the recipe closely except i used the frozen noodles that remind me of grandmas homemade noodles and it was really good with those next time ill probably add carrots too because it lacks a little color i also used precooked turkey that i cubed up but my husband requested shredded chicken next time too so ill try it again that way delicious
5,we love this one of our favorites
5,absolutely delicious half the amount of sour cream is plenty added carrots to give it some color a definite keeper in our house
5,this is a huge hit with my family it definitely lives up to its name
5,my whole family loved it it was quick amp easy i added a bag of frozen carrots and used fat free chicken noodle soup will definitely make this one again and again
5,it really comes together as fast as stated i used lightlowfat ingredients to make it a little healthier soooooo delicious i am about to make it again will also take to friends
5,this recipe is a classic i make it often add fresh carrots and celery to stock or celery seed of you dont have celery and it gives it great flavor
5,this is a wonderful recipe it is so quick and easy i added carrots and it tasted wonderful
5,i have been making this for years but usually with lite sour cream instead of the real thing well last time i tried it with real sour cream and it makes a big difference instead of just being good now it is so delicious you can hardly stop eating it num num num
5,we love this soup it is so fast and economical we make it many times during the winter months
5,left out the sour cream and used macaroni noodles instead
5,this is a fantastic recipe its a comforting soup when im feeling under the weather or just anytime i want a delicious hearty and easy to make meal i highly recommend this soup just as it is
5,we just made this again and it is so good we used a different kind of noodle and just put some sour cream in our own bowls instead of the pan sooo good
5,soooooo easy and so good i added carrot and celery next time ill add sauted mushroom and onion i also used a rotisserie chicken this is a staple soup with lots of options yummy
5,this is absolutely the best chicken noodle soup ever a friend shared this recipe with me and i have in turn shared it with many more friends it has become a staple at work whenever someone is in need of a meal ive used chicken breast and also seasoned rotisserie chicken which are the easiest it is wonderful with either the easy preparation and the economical cost make it even better
5,excellent just the way it is other than adding carrots and celery i followed the recipe and everyone loved it
5,this soup has become a family favorite and we have never added the sour cream we just usually never have it onhand we use leftover rotisserie chicken thats been shredded and regular curly noodles i think half the amount works good as they do swell up and absorb a lot of the liquid one of these days we will try with egg noodles and sour cream but it is still delicious my family calls it the good soup i will definitely keep this recipe
5,i absolutely love this i dont normally like pretzels but this dessert is phenomenal for the most part i followed the receipe but i changed a couple things i made it in a x glass dish i used fresh strawberries instead of frozen i did not add any extra sugar i really like the filling so i doubled the cream cheese basically i make the crust than i mix the jello topping and while its in the fridge i make the filling i folded in the whip cream instead of mixing it all together that takes about minutes or so then i poured the jello topping on top and put back in the fridge and it turned out perfect if you follow the directions everything should fit nicely however since i added the extra cream cheese the topping was overflowing i just poured in what fit and it was perfect ive read that people using fresh strawberries add extra sugar to them but i didnt and it doesnt need anybut thats up to you as for the extra jello that wouldnt fit i just put it in a seperate bowl and after it was set up added some whipped cream and had that as an extra dessert everyone loves this desserti will make it for everything
5,this dessert is a longtime favorite for potlucks in western pa and this is my favorite recipe for it i substitute real heavy whipping cream for a more natural taste and it holds up nicely i also use other fruits sometimes black cherries with black cherry jello blueberries with blueberry jello this is a dessert best eaten as fresh as possible as the pretzels will start to get soft after the first day i typically bake my crust the day before but wait until about hours before serving to assemble be sure to completely coolchill each layer before adding the next let the pretzel crust cool to room temp first chill after adding the cream cheese mix and most importantly let your jello mix cool before adding it to the top otherwise it will disturb the cream cheese mix and youll have very unattractive chunks of white in your red jello also be sure that the pretzel crust is sealed off from the jello or it will get soggy
5,this recipe is a familyloved classic that never goes out of style dont skip adding sliced sweetened strawberries it gives this recipe a wonderful fresh flavor and texture personally i prefer making homemade whipped cream using heavy whipping cream i have always made this recipe using strawberries and strawberry jello but i think i might try experimenting with different fruits and jello flavors this is definitely a star winner
5,this recipe has been made for our family gatherings for years now i took my first crack at it for a memorial day bbq and it was a hit i used fresh strawberries instead of frozen because i dont like the texture of frozen strawberries next time i might use less sugar to really play up the saltiness of the pretzels
5,my family has brought this to picnics for years but this was the first time i tried making it i kept finding my husband sneaking some of it at nightthats how i knew how good it really was make sure you make time cooling between layersit does help but can be tedious way worth it
5,although i didnt have any frozen berries all i had to do was freeze a pound of fresh berries while they were freezing i prepared the crust and cream cheese filling it worked great what a wonderfully fresh and delicious summer dessert
5,strawberry pretzel dessert is fantastic and cool whip works very well
5,refreshing and light i also made this recipe with raspberries from the garden and raspberry jello
5,halved the recipe and it still made a lot excellent flavor easy to make and the dessert turned out wonderfully reminds me of dairy queen soft serve strawberry sundae wonderful
5,i didnt have strawberries so i used raspberries it turned out delicious i will make it again with strawberries to compare
5,i made this for easter and it was so good wasnt able to find sweetened frozen strawberries at my grocery store so i used the unsweetened frozen sliced strawberries i made it the day before and followed the directions and test kitchen tips the crust was crunchy and the layers were so beautiful will make this again
5,absolutely delicious i always add some fresh lemon zest and a hefty squeeze of lemon juice to the cream cheese filling which according to the collegiate baseball player i hosted one summer takes this recipe over the top
5,i had great compliments on this it looked beautiful i didnt get to eat any as it was a donation for an event but those that tasted it were full of compliments i was nervous about the pretzel crust those same people said it was perfect
5,try raspberry jello with sliced strawberries
5,i use this recipe at thanksgiving but instead of strawberries i add cans of whole berry cranberry sauce to the strawberry gelatin it is so good
5,bez my moms recipe does not use jello crust is the same except cups coarsely crushed pretzels filling cream cheese and sugar only blended into envelopes of whipped dream whip topping is canned fruit pie filling maybe this is close to your grandmas my mom passed a few years back so this is the best i can do hope it helps
5,i grew up without any idea of jello salads etc i actually thought i hated jello because it was so blahhh my sweet friend pam made this for a bible study and my mouth came alive perfect blend of sweet
5,i was given a recipe very similar to this by a friend she called it strawberry salad all the ingredients are the same except for brown sugar in the crust and only box of jello i make it without the pretzels i use graham crackers instead this is my absolute favorite dessert i love every variation and make it every couple weeks my grandma always makes what she calls pretzel cake it is another variation made with dream whip and cherry pie filling instead of the strawberries and jello all of them are great and worth making for get togethers
5,my son requested this recipes so easy to make so delicious everyone enjoyed a second helping although one person would have preferred the more traditional graham cracker crust i did add a layer of fresh sliced strawberries before pouring on the jello mixture which really increased the great strawberry taste i will be making this again very soon
5,ive had this many times but it is the first time making it i added a little bit of vanilla to the cream cheese i also used fresh strawberries sliced and added some sugar after sitting for hour i stirred well then drained before adding to the gelatin topped the dessert with chopped pecans
5,have been making this for many years and always requested at our potlucks the last one i did was a frozen bag of strawberries blueberries blackberries and raspberries i used raspberry jello thank you for great recipes and this is another fool proof recipe and have one in the fridge right now
5,nice cold dessert
5,so deliciousi have made this many many times everyone loves it
5,love love this no other words need wonderful as written
5,huge success in my house of kids and a husband
5,my grandmother used to make this all the time its so good however she used to have the strawberrys in the middle and the whipped cream mix on the top with additional crushed pretzel pieces on top of that im so glad i found this
5,i used only half the sugar in the filling and it was absolutely delicious cool the crust thoroughly and eat within a day of making this
5,recipe was easy the hardest part was waiting on each step to chill it fit perfectly in a x pan none left over at all the grandkids loved it and i will definitely make again i followed the instructions exactly except my frozen strawberries were not sweetened i did not add sugar and it was still wonderful
5,this came out wonderful and everyone enjoyed it very simple to make but i could not find the frozen sliced strawberries at any of our markets so used fresh that i sliced up and added a touch of sugar to bring out the juice and added that to the jello was very fresh tasting and will definitely make again
5,always a favorite i sometimes do raspberry as well
5,i have made this delicious recipe for years it has always turned out wonderful receives great reviews and many requests for the recipe i prefer a coarser chop on the pretzels rather than totally crushed and use c because of this do let it cool completely cream the softened cream cheese and sugar well before folding in the whipped topping this makes it easier to spread be sure to seal all of the edges to the side of the pan and the partially set jellostrawberry mix will not soak into the other layers yummy
5,my family has enjoyed this for years i recently lost my recipe and failed to remember proportions thanks for printing them again
5,we love this dessert and make it all of the time its fabulous and turns out great every time thanks so much for sharing
5,this is a really great recipe
5,this is the best rave reviews at easter dinner

5,at any potluck this recipe is the first to go the sweet salty is divine
5,fantastic my husband loves spicy foods but the kids and i do not so i compromised and used half the calledfor amounts of both the green chiles and the cayenne the result was a dish that was a hit across the board after the first bite all were requesting that this become a regular on our family dinner table
5,yummy used light sour cream amp fat free half amp half and still tastes great
5,yum the only changes i made was using can of green chilis all i had light sour cream and milk also added cilantro this was so good will definitely make over and over

5,made this recipe as written and it was delicious i even got a this is really good from my husband the taste is wonderful and it is totally going into my recipe box
5,perfect dish for a snow day
5,this is seriously an amazing recipe it was spicy creamy and good on a cold alaskan night next time i will probably use half amp half or milk instead of the heavy cream no salt you dont even need it and greek yogurt instead of sour cream to make it more healthy and i am sure it will still be amazing mmmmmm oh and double it if you want a second meal out of it because ours did not make the servings it stated it would
5,my kids and i loved this husband doesnt eat sweets so more for us winner i saw some of the comments about the jello being too runny i used fresh strawberries macerated in sugar i poured them into the jello and let the jello strawberry mixture set for over an hour in the fridge i then poured it over the cream cheese mixture it was still pretty runny but set up really nice in the fridge
5,it turned out really good i drained the strawberries and used the juice in place of the water it didnt quite reach cups so i topped it off with water an it set in no time
5,i made this desert along time ago and i had forgotten how exactly to make it so glad you posted this now i can start making it again
5,my man loved this dessert was easy to make and tastes great
5,perfect i wouldnt change a thing
5,just made it after reading the reviews i cut the sugar in the cream cheese mixture to a half cup instead of the full cup delicious and gone very quickly will definitely make again soon
5,i have made this wonderful dessert several times and people keep asking me to please make it again it has the most savory taste a sweet blend of strawberries with the nutty and salty taste of the pretzels this is one dessert you wont regret making and im sure youll be asked to bring it again
5,ive been making this for years its one of my soninlaws favorites he likes it best made with raspberries
5,my family loves this i use raspberry jello and frozen sweetened raspberries
5,this is an excellent dessert had it on memorial day it was hit so easy to make nice dessert for a potluck dish you cant go wrong
5,the best had to make with gluten free pretzels and came out perfectly
5,this is a family favorite i find the saltiest pretzels to use because the sweetsalty is such a great combination
5,i have made this recipe for over years i make it upside down i was tired of soggy pretzels on the bottom if the cool whip layer was not sealed precisely i also liked to take this to school pot lucks in a disposable pan the sides of the aluminum pan are never smooth i put the jellostrawberry combo in the bottom of the pan and let that set up firm then i spread the cool whip layer i put the pretzels on right before serving to ensure they stay crunchy if you want you can leave the pretzels on the side in case someone does not like pretzels
5,favorite in our householdi use the x
5,this is definitely a make again my family and i loved it made exactly as directed and turned out perfect everyone was disappointed when it was gone
5,ive been making this for about years now and its always been a winner i think the people that are saying the cream layer is too thin are beating the mixture too much i just fold my ingredients together and it stays nice and fluffy and is plenty to cover a x pan ive also had an issue with the jello mixture leaking through to the pretzel layer but i know each time it happened i didnt make sure the cream layer went all the way to the edges that is important but if it does leak through its still pretty darn tasty
5,we use this for a senior party we have each month they love it
5,great dessert
5,this is a really good recipe i made it exactly as given with the addition of one teaspoon of vanilla to the cream cheese layer i might use two teaspoons next time i used an x pan because my x inch pan had something in it everything fit but the gelatin layer had enough extra for four ramekins of strawberry jello changes i would make next time add a full cup of butter to the pretzels add a teaspoon of unflavored gelatin to the jello to make it firmer i was worried it might melt in transit it didnt the ladies at church told me i could bring this again anytime
5,been making this for years everyone loves it a friend at work made it with raspberry jello and used the frozen mixed berries that is my new favorite
5,i have made this for over yrs its a gotta have at every holiday i use oz packages of cream cheese that i mix the sugar into with an electric mixer i then fold in with a spatula containers of cool whip spread all the way to edges i refrigerate while i make the jello layer i only use oz bag of unsweetened strawberries no juice i stir in cutting them into halves or quarters until jello thickens i then pour over the cream cheese layer and refrigerate a family favorite that with these tips i hope you enjoy a more consistent result
5,i make this sugar free and you cant tellits amazing been doing this for years its always requested and never gets tiring
5,the whole house loved it two even picked it for next birthday cake
5,love the salty and sweet together
5,we have made this for years love it with raspberry gelatin and tangy raspberries as well
5,i make this several times a year and love it i always make this when i go to potluck dinners unfortunately for me i take home an empty pan no left oversi have one problem with it whenever i make it and i follow the directions exactly the jello always slides off the filling on peoples plates what can i do so it stays together on someones plate it doesnt bother me but it has bothered those around me
5,i love this recipe i have been making it for years the only thing i do different is i add a can of drained crushed pineapple to the cream cheese layer so yummy
5,if you do not thaw the berries it helps the gelatin set up better and it wont be runny my family prefers this made with raspberries i add some fresh berries along with the frozen and also use unsweetened berries doing it this way we never have a runny gelatin problem or have the dessert separate
5,made this for christmas dinner so good after a heavy meal
5,this dish is a tradition for every one of our family gatherings it is one of the most requested dishes we dont wait for dessert we serve it as a part of the meal the combination of sweet and salty is perfect
5,best desert ever i used fresh strawberries and it tasted amazing ever time i make it its gone in minutes its always a request for any gathering i go to
5,i make this recipe out of a local recipe book that uses raspberries instead of strawberries im hungry for strawberries so gonna use them instead making this for our family lunch tomorrow i always double the pretzels because thats the best part but i dont double the butter this recipe is awesome
5,one of my favorite dishes that i feel is always good i took the suggestions of using a smaller dish and put it in x dish one reason was because i used my bigger dishes for other things it was full i ended up spilling the jello on the way to the fridge partly because i dont think it was set enough before hand i used fresh strawberries instead of frozen i suggest making sure you leave ample time between steps so layers have time to set
5,i use dole frozen sliced strawberries without the syrupstill tastes amazing i make this for everything
5,my grandmother gave me this recipe about years ago only she named it pretzel salad why i dont know i like the name of this recipe the only difference in recipes is i use powder sugar where yours calls out sugar i love love love this recipe its usually at the holidays that i make it but you can make it every week if you want its that good
5,it was soooo good the differant flavors hitting my taste buds was awesome love it
5,this is one of our favorite recipes i always make it for easter and this year my year granddaughter went crazy for it love it everyone should try it
5,perfect combo of sweet amp salty so good oi used fresh strawberries instead of frozen
5,very good operfect combo of sweet amp saltyi would reccomend putting the pretzels in a blender or food processor and pulsing them a few times it is quicker and easier than putting them in a bag and pounding them also i used fresh strawberries yum
5,a family favorite made it for christmas and hoped for left oversthere were none good any time of year for any occasion
5,summertime at its best my elderly neighbor i grew up beside gave me this recipe years ago the only thing i do differently is use fresh strawberries yum
5,really good
5,great recipe i have been making it for years you can make it with splenda in place of sugar and use sugar free jello this recipe is a must for thanksgiving and christmas dinners
5,really love the taste i used sugar free jello stevia as sugar substitute fresh sliced strawberries and low fat dairy my only complaint was that the pretzel crust was so crumbly i did put pretzels in the blender any suggestions how to get a more compact crust that sticks together
5,this is a great recipe been making it for years i switch off by using raspberries in place of the strawberries equally as good either way of course change the jello to raspberry as well
5,the sweetness of the cream cheese mixture and strawberries is a nice contrast to the saltiness and crunch of the pretzels ive made this recipe as a side dish snack and dessert
5,love it been looking for this one for a long time tasted it several years ago at a gathering but didnt know what it was called thanks for posting it
5,my husband raved about this dessert easy and delicious going to make it again very soon
5,my husband just loves this i even tried it with blueberries and raspberries yummy
5,amazing everyone in my house loves it i have to double the recipesometimes triple it
5,i added red pepper with onions in the beginning and also added corn with the beans my boyfriend was skeptical about white chili but this recipe is definitely a keeper i will be making this again for sure
5,absolutely amazing will make again and again i will use one can of chilies this time instead though as we are feeding a few kiddos
5,i loved this very tasty
5,this was delicious i used only one can of chilis and used half and half instead of heavy cream it was a hit in my family yum
5,i made this as is for a gathering and it was a huge hit even the little ones wanted seconds
5,made this last month it was a big hit everyone was fighting for the leftovers
5,i love this recipe i have made it several times and it is a favorite i usually use cans of beans i like more beans in my chilie this is spicey so make sure to have bread handy excellent
5,its so good its great over rice
5,this is great i will make this several more times for sure
5,this is the same recipe my father always made for me although he always used just oz can of green chilies but the people in my house werent very good with hot food oz gives enough heat that you can feel it but its not too overwhelming friends and family always love it
5,a winner with everyone at my house easy to make nice bite without burning on the way down
5,excellent this ones a keeper for sure
5,i got this recipe from taste of home years ago and everyone loves it there are never any leftovers we like it with tortilla chips instead of crackers or bread have shared it with church because everyone wants this recipe
5,my husband says this is the best chili hes ever had it is delicious this recipe is definatey a keeper
5,i agree this recipe is the best i make it exactly as written and everyone loves it i have also made it with ground beef and beef broth and everyone loves it
5,this is a great recipe i did my prepping in the morning so all i had to do was put it together in the afternoon i will double the recipe next time everyone in the family went back to seconds my dad age loves it and already asked me to make it again
5,this is really as good as the reviews said i made exactly as per recipe i will likely double next time
5,i served along with some nice crusty bread and received nothing but compliments at the bowling banquet thats what im talkin about
5,this is excellent i used macaroni noodles instead of penne and skipped the blender step
5,great recipe you can substitute pretty much any heartier pasta you have on hand i personally do not put the tomatoes in a blender as i like them more chunky i also dont layer i just put everything together and top with the cheeses perfect comfort food
5,this is an excellent recipe i have made it three times now i prepare the recipe as written and double it my soninlaw is italian and he appreciates it each time i make it can be prepared the day before and placed in the oven when everyone arrives also any leftovers if there are any are just as delicious when reheated
5,i sub the chicken with beans and use veggie stock and whole wheat penne a great vegetarian meal
5,i followed the recipe except for using a can of tomatoes with basil garlic and oregano it was very good but hubby and i both agreed that we would like it even better with italian sausage and thats how i will make it next time thank you for the recipe
5,great recipe it was a hit at our easter party
5,this is a family favorite
5,sooo good perfect blend of flavors everyone loves it make sure to crush pretzels very well
5,loved it and the aroma in your kitchen will dazzle your senses followed to the recipe
5,this recipe was a success i made a few changes i didnt use red peppers because i had none instead i threw in a can of those diced green chiles gave it a nice flavor also added two tablespoons of ricotta in with the sauce also used a tiny bit more chicken than called for and to be honest i could have gone with even more chicken in retrospect i would easily use lbs instead of next time
5,made as directed wonderful flavor i will definitely make this a regular
5,made this for my family of picky eaters i read previous comments as well prior to making yes it does take some prep time as people have statdd also scared for it to be bland as i knew id be leaving out salt to accommodate sodiumrestricted family members i took the advice of doubling up the other spices i used mozzarella provalone and parmesan for the cheeses this was a huge hit with everyone and i love that it seems like this recipe could leave room for a lot of little personal tweaks and substitutions if one so chose to implement any definitely committing this to the recipe book
5,excellent recipe everyone loved it the sauce would be great with any pasta i am going to make a lasagna today using the sauce
5,this is a delicious casserole it does take some prep work before baking but well worth it we found it to be dry the first time so we like to double the sauce
5,this is an excellent recipe very tasty
5,i was all set to make this and realized i didnt have enough of any shaped pasta so i substituted angel hair i followed the recipe as written and we all loved it now i always use angel hair and i do double the sauce amount
5,fantastic recipe my daughter helped me last night and it was delicious easy to make and im glad i had her help i ended up making a few changes by accident i could not find a green bell pepper so we used the sweet red and orange pepper i did not have chicken thighs on hand so i used chicken breasts i used pounds i added cups of gluten free penne pasta along with the spices except red pepper flakes mentioned to use i also added mrs dash garlic and herb and black pepper did not measure just eyed it when added i also added cup of sodium free chicken broth due to the extra half cup of pasta cooked as instructed and the remaining uncovered was cooked for only minutes i did forget to add the romano cheese no one really noticed i will make this again and add into our rotation we paired this with a nice spinach salad looking forward to left overs
5,you definitely need to double this as usual w me i tweaked it to fit my needstaste even with doubling this i used a bit more chicken red amp green peppers onion and garlic plus i used a bit less cheese not a fan of too much ooeygooey cheese i used olive oil instead of canola oil turned out exactly as i had envisioned oh who came up with min prep time this was time consuming but so is any homemade dish that requires this much cutting blending sautéing etc be prepared for a cpl of hours it was worth it love that i have leftovers the intention it tasted so healthy and so notrestauranty which is usually so salty amp bloats me yuck
5,i doubled this and substituted a pound of lean ground beef for the chicken and beef broth for the chicken broth great sauce recipe thank you carmen and toh
5,now i know why you said your family never tires of this recipe i used a pound of preseasoned italian chicken breast i had in the freezer i did rinse the chicken before cooking so the seasoning didnt mix with the recipe glad to see this recipe was a contest winner because it deserves the highest rating possible
5,really enjoyed this recipe loved the little bit of heat the crushed red pepper flakes gave it this is definitely a keeper
5,excellent i have made so many different versions of this it is hard to know where to start i have increased the spices teaspoons added fresh spinach added fresh basil andor basil paste doubled the onion green pepper and red bell pepper and i have added green onion
5,loved the flavor will definitely make again and again
5,yum added some italian seasoning liked the heat from the red pepper flakes
5,i would like the nutritional value please
5,i made this last night exactly as the recipe said extra garlic just to use it up and no wine it was amazing reminded me of a lasagna with the cheesy goodness i questioned only using cups of dry penne pasta but im glad i didnt use more it filled an x pan to the top put a sheet underneath to catch drips while baking and easily serves this is a keeper
5,perfect dinnerspiced perfectmy husband loved it and wants it again soon stars
5,i made this recipe tonight and we thought it was delicious i did read some of the reviews and made some changes i used italian style tomatoes without blending and i increased the basil and oregano to teaspoons it gave the dish plenty of flavor i baked it for minutes then removed the cover and finished cooking the last minutes it was perfect we will be having this again i highly recommend itvolunteer field editor
5,i love this recipe it was so tasty and delicious
5,yep its that good
5,deconstructed lasagna i used cottage cheese as i didnt have any romano cheese
5,husband loves it
5,love the flavors of this dish as one vernonite to another thank you for this recipe
5,awesome my family nearly fought over who would get to take the leftovers to school and work with them today do yourself a favor double the recipe absolutely one of the best pasta dishes ive had ever prep time takes a bit longer than noted but worth every minute company and special occasion worthy hands down
5,outstanding i made this and took the leftovers to workeveryone asked for the recipe and a couple of people went home and made it that night i did make a couple of small changes i used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder and because i didnt have any heavy cream i substituted a couple of tablespoons of cream cheese this was soooooo good cant wait to make it again thank you for this recipe
5,wow used fresh garlic added tlb fresh cilantro and rotisserie chicken rather than cooking my own made day in advance so it sat in the fridge one day wow was awesome and sooooo easythanks a million
5,phenomenal im not normally a huge chili fan this is definitely going on my favorites list d
5,i love this recipe although one time i made the mistake of adding jalapenos cans were virtually identical instead of the chilies which made it way too hot for my taste but the rest of the group loves spicy food so it ended up working out i have made it several times since then and everyone loves it
5,my daughter first made this recipe and it since has become a favorite of everyone i make mine with boneless skinless chicken thighs that my husband smokes with hickoryit makes this chili beyond incredible
5,this chili is delicious and very easy to make the sour cream at the end tames the bite of the chili but doesnt overpower the complementary flavors serve this with a nice hunk of baguette for a tasty lunch
5,easy and the kids loved it one of my favorites
5,best while chicken chili ive ever had super delicious
5,amazing
5,this is a favorite of my husband amp mine i add frozen corn to it its delicious with corn bread as a side
5,i use cans of beans and cans of green chilis for thicker chili i cant even count how many times ive cooked this it never gets old
5,this recipe was delicious and will be made again this recipe turned out a little soupier than the picture so next time i plan on adding additional cans of northern beans one can of beans pureed to help thicken the chili without adding additional fat and the other can just to add more stuff into the chili even though i will change a few things for my personal taste this was delicious just as is
5,what an amazing dish follow the recipe exact and you wont be disappointed oh my gosh is this goodoh and i just used chicken breast cubed as that is what i had on hand will try it with thighs nextbet that will be even more incredible as flavorful as thighs are
5,amazing recipe except i use chicken breast instead of chicken thighs and i left off the crushed red pepper flakes due to my crohns disease thanks for sharing this recipe
5,oh my this is an excellent recipe easy to make and no left overs thank you for sharing
5,this was absolutely deliciousi made it exactly according to the recipe and it turned out perfectly i was thinking of adding some spinach or eggplant for a little extra color but im glad i didnt will be making and sharing this recipe often
5,great dish i used chicken breast instead of thighs because that is what was in my kitchen my family enjoyed it so i will be making it again
5,made this tonightwas very goodi used chicken breast alsoi also doubled the sauce cause it didnt seem like it would be enoughglad i did it came out awesome
5,i made this dish tonight and it was delicious i only used cups of cheese and also used jarred spaghetti sauce instead of processing tomatoes and paste turned out great i also added my own seasonings on top of whats called for in the recipe to give it a lil more spice
5,everyone says this is time consuming good dishes usually are but you can also shortcut i used jarred arrabbiata sauce that really upped the flavor
5,i made this for dinner last night it was awesome this will be one i make over and over again my kids loved it for lunch the next day too
5,made this tonight full well thinking it would be better tomorrow after the flavors blended im sure it will be but it was pretty darn fantastic right away i didnt have romano cheese but used freshgrated parmesan very acceptable substitution
5,very flavorful does take awhile to prepare but its worth it
5,delicious we all loved it and will make it again
5,starsim always on the lookout for great casseroles and this one fits the billyou can use any leftover chopped poultryive even prepared this with our leftover holiday turkeyi also streamlined the recipe by using an italian blend seasoning omitted the salt as we watch our sodium intake prepared chopped or crushed garlic an italianblend cheese and grated parmesan cheese in place of the romanoit is delicious and so versatile
5,i have been making this recipe regularly without processing the tomatoes i also add a whole oz can of paste and just add some water if necessary last week i added some chopped salami and pepperoni that was leftover from another recipe and it really added to the flavor
5,easy to make and yummy will definately be making this again soon
5,this recipe is so versatilewe prefer boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of thighs i use italian seasoning blend instead of the individual spices for ease of preparationthere are also many varieties of diced tomatoes available fireroasted are a nice change as well as using italian blend shredded cheese
5,i made this today and it was very very good i used chicken breasts and a can of italian diced tomatoes i didnt have the peppers so will plan better next time we all loved this casserole and i know we will be making it again real soon
5,very good receipe didnt have green pepper so used a whole red pepper and chesse italian blend for the mozzarella the wife wants me to make this next week for her girls card party
5,sounds really good my hubs isnt fond of green bell peppers i usually dice up some zucchini andor eggplant and sometimes in lieu of chicken sauté a pound of ground sweet or hot italian sausage to the sauce mixture i make my own allday marinara

5,my family loved it

5,this is delicious my husbands favorite casserole and my kids love it too
5,the spiciness made me step back and go where did that come from it was absolutely fantastic much better than your average chicken penne casserole
5,delicious and easy a definite weeknight winner in our house you can use chicken breast if you dont have the thighs on hand and i just use a can of crushedpureed tomatoes or tomato sauce along with the paste that way i dont have to get out my blender i can just dump it in the pan and save time great blend of spices and seasonings too
5,delicious used lb leftover cooked chicken and added cup mushrooms to the vegetable mix as i had them and wanted to use them up
5,this recipe is a keeper if my husband goes back for seconds very good
5,i wanted to share my changes since i make this quite often i skip the blender step and add a whole oz can of tomato paste instead of chicken broth i just add a half cup of wine ive also been using a shredded italian cheese blend which adds another layer of flavor
5,excellent a perfect amount of spice loved it will make it again and again
5,the was amazing i doubled it and accidentally tripled the chick stock so i had to cook it longer which i recommend regardless and added some more water and a cut potato to absorb the salt of the chicken stock i added some ricotta i had in the frige but that was the only change my family isnt huge on spicy but i decided just to do it exactly as it stated anywayi refer to the pepper flakes i am so glad i did just a touch of hotness and the kids loved it too and thanks for a great dish
5,very very good will definitely make again although hubby asked to skip the red pepper flakes next time

5,we just tried this hubby is very satisfied i want to try it with sausage instead of the chicken delicious thanks for sharing this one
5,ive made this recipe a couple of times we like that it uses chicken thighs and the kick that it gets from the red pepper flakes its a nice alternative to a ground beef pasta dish i usually keep parmesan cheese on hand so i used it instead of romano
5,i think this recipe is perfect as is i tried a batch just as instructed and a batch whipping the egg whites first the batch with whipped egg whites may have looked a bit prettier but were airy and crumbly not nearly as good
5,no question about it this is the best macaroon recipe ive ever seen easy to prepare easy to clean up fabulous tasting ive made this recipe twice and each time theyve turned out great only one change i used emunemsweetened shredded coconut to reduce the sugar content by the way i discovered that the smaller the shred of the coconut the better the consistency of the finished product
5,this dish was fantastic i have passed this recipe on to many friends
5,this was great
5,this recipe is great its become a family favorite
5,my family loves this too
5,i made this for the first time tonight i took some liberties and used a different pasta and didnt puree the tomatoes my husband loved it said it was the best thing ive cooked recently i will definitely make this again
5,this looks like a great casserole for church potlucks im always looking for new recipes thanks
5,had this casserole at my daughterinlaws its a keeper
5,tried chicken penne casserole for the first time today it was so good i will make this again soon
5,i boil the chicken with carrots onions astalk of celery and garlicthen shred it the chicken can be kept in the freezer until you need it for something like this dish if youre using the chicken right away use the broth instead of the canned stuff
5,i agree the chicken penne casserole was good usually my husband does not like casserolesbut he liked this one
5,my family loved this with every bite they would mmmm and say this is so good you have to make this again
5,very tasty flavors were awesome i agree with several of the reviews of it being too soupy next time ill take the advice of several and add another can of beans ill definitely make this again thanks for a great recipe
5,what a delicious alternative to regular chili i had a sample before adding the creams and enjoyed it just as much as the finished product
5,one of our family favorites super easy to make and tastes wonderful i sub ground chicken for the breasts and it makes it even easier amp more chili like
5,delicious this is a new favorite the only things i added were cans of black beans and half a bottle of beer great recipie thank you
5,we make this recipe several times a year a family favorite
5,when cooking for others this dish is one of the most requested i like to use ground turkey instead of chicken breasts its cheaper and i like the texture a little bit better my husband isnt a fan of chili but he loves this
5,excellent will make often
5,awesome every time i make this someone asks me for the recipe you can always play with the heat level by adding jalapeno
5,this was delicious and super easy to prepare i added fresh garlic and hot sauce and used light whipping cream i also seasoned the chicken with a blend of poultry spice this was so yummy i was proud to serve it and will absolutely make it again
5,i make this recipe at least a half dozen times each year to make it faster i buy a rotisserie chicken from the deli and add dried onions instead of fresh dinner can be ready in minutes and my entire family loves it
5,this is my first time making chicken chilithis just looked good so i tried it and it was really goodi used a whole chicken and made my homemade brothkicked it up with habanero pepper and smoked salti will make this again and again
5,i got this recipe years ago in a taste of home magazine i have made it so many times my little recipe card is getting worn out it is incredibly yummy and so easy to make
5,our favorite recipe instead of chicken i use browned ground turkey excellent
5,one of my absolute favorite recipes
5,i did a double batch and then a single one i think single one were better i would give its the best
5,my husband loves these
5,i think that the coconut qty is c i used oz they are crispy so added more egg whites seems recipe is off unless i am only making dip i made macaroons
5,i actually tweaked this by whipping the egg whites to soft peaks before combining with dry ingredients i also used coconut extract instead of vanilla amp unsweetened shredded coconut the finely shredded kind not the big flakes they come soooo fluffy and delicious and just the right amount of sweetness
5,thank you for sharing this recipe the cookies were so good and easy to make
5,my husband and i loves these cookies this time ill try beating the egg whites to soft peak thanks for sharing
5,i made these exactly as recipie states i whipped the egg whites for just a couple minutes it made macaroons baked for minutes my dad is a very harsh critic and a huge coconut fan he said they were perfect so yes this recipe is amazing thank you
5,this turned out perfectly i whipped the egg whites until they were like styrofoam consistency and then added it to the rest of the dry ingredients my normal cookie scoop didnt work to drop them on the cookie sheet so id use my hands to turn them into small rounds on the cookie sheet i also didnt measure out the coconut i just added the entire bag of coconut i was being lazy to be honest any ways they turned out great and taste delicious i think im going to drizzle them with chocolate before i serve them just too make them look a little more festive
5,this recipe was easy fast and so so delicious if you follow it like the video it comes out perfectly i did not whip the eggs until stiff peaks and it was perfect i will probably double or triple the recipe because that was barley enough for our family of
5,i like the ingredients and portions but this is how i put them together in an upright mixer beat the egg whites until they are stiff peaks add vanilla in another bowl mix the other ingredients and fold them into the egg whites i baked them on parchment paper and they were delicious
5,i modified this recipe to a keto cookie substituting coconut flour and keto sugar i whipped the egg whites to a peak added vanilla and folded in the other combined ingredients they turned out crisp and very good
5,followed the recipe exactly and it made delicious normalsized macaroons will definitely make again
5,i followed the recipe as it was written didnt whip the egg whites first they are delicious ill be making them again
5,perfection amazing flavor and texture these would be a really yummy treat with a cup of coffee or tea definitely a keeper
5,omg made these tonight super yummy super fast
5,the texture and taste came out perfect i only had unsweetened coconut so i added just a tad more sugar and also added chocolate chips my family inhaled them and asked me to make them again so easy
5,they turned out delicious i didnt have vanilla extract so i used vanilla almond coffee creamer and it worked like a charm
5,i doubled the recipe used fine almond flour instead of wheat used unsweetened coconut and cut back the sugar a bit beat the egg whites a little and baked on parchment paper at for minutes they were golden but really sticky who cares when husband pronounces them spectacular you have a winner next time ill beat the whites longer with some cream of tartar and bake at the original temp so they can go a touch longer and grease the parchment paper although nibbling the stuck bits off was the bakers reward
5,just made them i added tbsp of almond flour sweetened coconut and unsweetened vanilla and almond extract i let the mix sit for minutes and scooped them in baking cups for a uniform shape
5,super simple and delicious i followed the recipedirections to a t and they turned out perfectly you literally drop a spoonful of the batter to make a cookie there is no secret method to doing this they are not as crisp on the top the following day after being stored in air tight container but are still absolutely delicious make sure your eggs are room temp
5,i am already making my fourth batch they are delicious and i did not need to put the vanilla extract i tried it with and without and they were delicious both ways they only make a small batch though so i would suggest making a double batch because they are so delicious
5,i made these macaroons last sunday they were excellent i did not need to whip the egg whites i followed the recipe as is and the macaroons turned out beautifully a very particular relative loved them and asked for the recipe for gluten free can i substitute the flour with cornstarch or tapioca if yes what would be the quantity thank you for sharing your gifts and talents with so many of us happy mothers day
5,i purchased unsweetened coconut at the grocery yesterday and came across this recipe this morning i tweaked it slightly to be keto friendly by using almond flour instead of regular flour and stevia instead of sugar i also used lemon extract instead of vanilla as i am a huge lemon fan and just happened to have it on hand they turned out absolutely beautiful and so delicious
5,fantastic i used lemon extract instead of vanilla and whipped the egg whites briefly till frothy but followed the recipe exactly otherwise in minutes the macaroons were done and amazing ill definitely be making them again thank you
5,ive made these several times with bobs redmill to glutenfree baking flour i didnt do anything but what the recipe said and they came out well they remind me of my grandmothers macaroons i try to get them into a ball shape on the cookie sheet because any spread will brown much more than the rest of the cookiethe dough is quite loose in uncooked state they are very sweetbut i like that
5,my husband loves the chocolate dipped macaroons from panera bread when i saw this recipe i thought id make some for him for fathers day i only had unsweetened coconut on hand so i used that i made one other change so the macaroons were more like the ones my husband loves once they cooled i dipped the bottoms into melted chocolate and when they set i drizzled melted chocolate on top they turned out beautifully my husband said they were even better than panera breads definitely a win thank you for such a yummy and simple recipe
5,aside from doubling the measurements i followed this recipe exactly as written from the roomtemp degrees fahrenheit unwhipped egg whites to the rounded teaspoons i didnt change a thing i needed to bake them about minutes to get a bit of golden color but they came out exactly as pictured and described i have beautiful and delicious macaroons to take to an event this evening i will definitely come back to this recipe i found these to be a little too sweet for my taste so ill try it with less sugar next time but i wanted to let others know that there is no need to bother with whipping the egg whites i had a little trouble getting them off the first pan but i think thats because i let them cool a little before transferring them to a wire rack for the second pan i transferred them as soon as they came out of the oven and it was no trouble at all i dont know if its because they were still hot and soft or because it was a different type of pan but ill transfer them immediately from now on great recipe
5,ive made this recipe exactly as written both without and with whipping the egg whites to soft peak the results are great either way whipped whites naturally give the macaroons a lighter and airier texture versus being denser and chewier my preference when not whipped if you cant be bothered or if you just want a denser texture dont whip the whites and the cookies will be just fine despite the pedantic naysaying of the pedantic naysayers
5,totally forgot to whip the eggs but it turned out great anyway exactly like the picture
5,these are exceptional just perfect i used organic unsweetened coconut flakes trader joes and used cup sugar with an extra small teaspoon since the coconut was unsweetened since my coconut flakes were extremely dry i just added a couple of drops literally of water and crushed the flakes a bit more tossing and softening them just a bit before adding everything else my egg whites were cold not room temperature i was impatient ha and i whisked them with them with the vanilla they were absolutely amazing perfectly crisp on the outside and perfectly light and yet moist on the inside delicious definitely deserved your blue ribbon award at the fair thank you for posting this
5,these turned out awesome i followed recipe but substituted sweetened coconut for unsweetened coconut and all purpose flour for gluten free flour due to an allergy i added a couple drops of water to the unsweetened coconut like another reviewer suggested and also whipped the egg whites i had to increase cooking time about minutes in order for them to be golden but when they finished they came out delicious will definitely be making again
5,came out perfectly i used parchment paper cooled them for a minute or two before transferring to a cooling rack and there was no sticking at all i got small cookies from this recipe ill probably double it next time just so theres plenty quick and reliablewill be a go to recipe for sure
5,this is my second review and it still gets five stars my husband has digestive issues and all it takes is two macaroons a day to help him out this recipe is quick and simple and makes just a small batch about to cookies which is perfect thanks for sharing
5,excellent macaroons i love sweets they were delicious thanks for the recipe
5,i too was sceptical when i read the directions but was pleasantly surprised with the outcome i bake in germany so have two differences i used unsweeteed dry coconut and i bake on parchment the mix was not overly sticky so i could form small balls instead of using two spoons probably due to the low moisture content of the coconut they baked like a charm i got cookies from this recipe i took them to my first holiday party with my new company and my boss inhaled them she said that i can keep my job will try dipping the bottoms in chocolate next time as suggested by previous contributor ran out of time this batch a very simple way to use up leftover egg whites which have a habit of collecting in my refrigerator
5,turned out perfect
5,this is my new go to macaroon recipe after trying this new recipe and the raves on this cookie i threw my old recipe away very easy to make a chocolate drizzle is very tasty also the white chocolate can be tinted for the various holidays
5,excellent fast recipehusband really likes it and it makes a perfect batch for people
5,sitting here munching on one these are fantastic so glad i didnt use the recipe with the condensed milk these are perfect not too sweet
5,first off if you follow the recipe exactly like its stated your cookies will turn out perfectly this was the first time i have ever made coconut macaroon cookies and it will definitely not be the last couldnt ask for a better recipe thank you for sharing
5,this is an accurate review made exactly as recipe was written stars super easy to make and a fabulous tasting macaroonthis one is a keeperthank you so much for this recipe i can see why you won st placeawesometamileer
5,i wish i could show you a picture of how beautiful these came out followed the recipe exactly using large eggs not xl and decided to just do an even dozen they baked for minutes at f they smell amazing and taste is so good
5,a tiny bit sweeter than i prefer and doesnt make nearly enough will make again and will try dipping the bottoms in chocolate although that will probably mean they will all be eaten at once yummy
5,these were perfect if you like coconut youll love these its a great passover desert because it has no leaven my only complaint is it has too many calories lol i would like to eat the whole batch but i have to have a little discipline
5,just made these for the first timewow fantastic i can tell ill quadruple the recipeand never buy them again may thhave made them timesnow ready to make a quadruple batch you do not need to whip the whites i use unsweetened flakes but organic sugar i take ghirardelli choc melt it with a tad of oconut oildip the bottoms and drizzle on topeveryone loves them
5,i made it just as is and did not whip the egg whites turned out delicious they spread a bit on the bottom but im thinking if i would have beaten the egg whites they would of held their form better i put spoonfuls on plain parchment paper on a pampered chef baking stone and they came off easily whipped or not whipped i think they are awesome next time i will try whipping them they made one dozen cookies for me
5,these are very good i quadrupled the recipe as it doesnt make very many but only used egg whites and they were easier to bake and kept their form we like ours with a cherry on top and the bottom dipped in chocolate but they are good just plain also
5,i lived in a small town in nj when i was a child a quaint little place there was one butchers shop with sawdust on the floor and one bakery that had the most glorious display of goodies of all their creations i loved the macaroons the best some memories never go away you brought me back to the s thank you
5,perfect and one of my all time favorites no one sells them anymore but where i live there isnt a proper butcher shop deli or bakery these are easy to make and i beat or whip the egg whites first mix the other ingredients and fold in the whipped egg whites people are polarized they either love coconut or they dont luckily my group loves them as much as i do and a simple quick recipe too
5,i have been making this recipe for a couple of years now it is extremely popular with family amp friends we like to serve with buffalo wing sauce for an extra kick
5,ive made this too many times to countbut instead of using the chicken breast i use smoked boneless chicken thighs hubby cooks them i modify the seasonings to suit our tastes today i used smoked cumin alot of ancho chili pepper and ample cayenne i use halfnhalf instead of heavy cream and light sour cream did i mention to add alot of garlic this chili is always amazing its a family fave
5,loved this chili made a few alterations taking a cue from other reviews added a can of navy beans chopped crimini mushrooms a jalepeno and a bit extra cayenne pepper will make again great recipe
5,this soup is so good i added diced jalapenos and extra beans and used amp will be making this for christmas eve dinner with the kids yum
5,wowwwwww so good love it
5,great recipe it was delicious
5,i love love this recipe
5,excellent the only thing id do different next time is use less sour cream my picky eater who doesnt like anything spicy ate this and asked for seconds not spicy dont let the cayenne pepper fool you
5,yum yum yum this was absolutely delicious my husband who doesnt usually eat this sort of thing loooves it i double the recipe and put some in the freezer
5,this recipe is delicious ive been making this for at least years i serve this at bingo quite a few times during the winter ive gotten so many compliments on this its also a favorite at home
5,fabbbbuuuullllooouuuussss the best nonred chili i have ever had
5,i made this for my family today and according to my husband and yr old son this is the best chili ever i did however make a few changes i used smoked turkey breast that my husband made over the holidays instead of the chicken i also used fresh garlic cloves minced and did not saute the meat onion and garlic i substituted italian seasoning for the oregano and white pepper for the pepper last of all i just dumped everything in the crock pot set on high for about hours adding the sour cream and cream the last half hour delicious
5,amazing my whole family loves this
5,this is the best chicken chili i have ever had it is worth the time to make i suggest doubling the recipe though if more than people are eating it as it doesnt make very much the next time i make im going to try lowfat sour cream and whipping cream to try to cut down on the cals love it
5,wonderful flavour with just a little kick to it didnt have any cumin so added a teaspoon thyme
5,this is definitely a first place macaroon recipe it has the best color taste and consistency of all i have tried including the one on the coconut bag one addition i make is to sub in a almond extract just because i like that flavor vanilla extract and almond extract it also works just fine to use cooking spray instead of crisco to grease your cookie sheets i quadrupled the recipe and it made macaroons using a teaspoon measure to scoop each serving i live at high altitude in denver and did not need to do any substitutions
5,these were great i made them bigger than teaspoons and used rice flour to make them gluten free they were so easy and tasty i am sure i will be making these again and again
5,these were awesome
5,anyone looking for something quick and easy to do with those yolks whisk them in a microwavesafe bowl add a tiny drop or two of cooking sherry optional a knob of butter a tbls or two of milk whisk and microwave for seconds whisk again and microwave for another seconds until the desired consistency is reached on two halves of toasted buttered muffin or bagel that makes a terrific breakfast or lunch for one ive done it youll like itthe macaroons by the way are perfect and so quick and easy to make ill be having that scrambled egg with yolks often
5,these came out perfect they did not run i even whipped the egg whites not knowing not to i did use a silpat liner on my pan maybe thats why they didnt run they are lovely morsels i did only get cookies though will double next time
5,these are a favorite of my year old son i use less sugar for him he still loves them
5,the first time i made this recipe it didnt come out too well then i discovered that the recipe has omitted a step you have to beat the egg whites to a soft peak before you add them to the coconut then the recipe came out great
5,super easy i melted semi sweet chocolate chips in microwave then dipped bottoms of macaroons after they cooled beautiful and taste like mounds candy but in a cookie
5,yummy and supper easy to make will definitely make this recipe again
5,really easy to make and taste great after i made the first batch my husband looked at me and said can you make more he wanted less sugar in it this time cause he said it was too sweet
5,some recipes call for condensed milk and are too sweet this recipe is perfect light and the coconut flavor wins out
5,this is great and easy it tastes very similar to what we used to get a long time ago from a restaurant i will definitely do it again and probably fix five times as much this will be a recipe that is made oftenperfect with a cup of coffee and egg whites were not beaten before mixing it together
5,my family really enjoyed these in fact i dipped them in nutella and it was a huge hit i did want to say to fluff the egg whites until there are peaks pour in the vanilla mix some more then fold in the egg whites no runningat all they were absolutely delicious
5,crispy little bites of deliciousness
5,as a food blogger my number one pet peeve is when somebody butchers my recipe by not following instructions and adding and substituting and then comes onto my blog and leaves a negative comment when it doesnt turn outif you follow this recipe exactly as written and dont beat the egg whites and dont add nuts and substitute things it comes out five stars a perfect macarooni will say that i dont know in what alternate universe this makes macaroons because i doubled the recipe and still only got out of ita real winner though and i will make again
5,simple and delicious
5,i have made these several times and they are a hit every time they are so easy to make and only once did i have to add an extra egg white and that could have been due to small eggs
5,awesome recipe
5,really good and easy i added chopped almonds and dipped the tops in chocolate they were like almond joys
5,good recipe follow recipe exactly and it works ladyreader this is to rate the recipe and to help other cooks decide whether to use the recipe or not this rating system should not be used to correct spelling and grammar unless it effects the recipe not helpful and unfair to the recipe rating
5,easy and wonderful recipe its number one in my book
5,best macaroons everfound these in my toh cookbook and decided to make them for my bf as part of an anniversary gift he sees baking for someone as a real declaration of love he and everyone else who has had any has told me they were the best theyd ever tasted even my roommate who doesnt like coconut loves themthe store bought ones dont even rate compared to thesemust try
5,these cookies were easy to make and tasted good too they turned out perfectly some of the reviews said they were runny mine were not however if egg whites stand too long they do get runny maybe these cookies were mixed up but not baked right away
5,worked out perfect as is i used shredded coconut as that is what i had i did microwave a couple handfuls of chocolate chips checking at sec intrivals and stirring until just melted than dipped some of the maccaroons and places them on parchment tried to let them cool but we ate them before that could happen they are delis with or without chocolate i would recommend using less sugar if your coconut is sweetened or you are using lots of chocolate
5,these cookies are absolutely delicious they are extremely easy to make on a moments notice i like to half dip them in wilton microwavable chocolate everyone loves them and they look beautiful as well
5,followed directions as written and everything turned out perfectly we dipped them in chocolate ganache to add to the yum will make them again and again
5,quick amp easy to make in my over they were done in mins lightly browned amp crunchy on the outside amp soft amp chewy on the inside i combined the mixture in the bowl using a fork instead of using a teaspoon to drop cookies onto baking sheet i used tablespoon instead the cookies came out a nice size i cooked the cookies on parchment paper these cookies are delicious
5,just made this for a church event i have already been contacted by people for the recipe double the recipe it is that good i made as directed except i started by beating the egg whites a bit then added all the other ingredients one at a time ending with the coconut i used almond extract instead i used two teaspoons to drop and form the small mounds on parchment paper instead of greasing the pans at minutes they were perfect thanks for a recipe i am proud to share
5,i was looking for a quick and easy yet delicious macaroon recipe and i found it my husband loved it i followed the recipe to the letter and all i can say is i will have to double the recipe next time just not enough with batch
5,i have had store bought macaroons here and therei am years old and never made them beforei found this recipe excellent and so easy to make one batch got a bit browner and it was still amazingly good thanks for sharing this recipe
5,these are very moist and delicious my husband loves them and hes not even a huge fan of coconut i used a mini cupcake pan to ensure that the egg white did not run out of the coconut and they came out perfect a little red and green sugar gave them a pretty holiday look
5,very easy to make and was very good this is a keeper
5,based on the other ratings i will give you stars lol i was just wondering if the coconut should be sweetened or unsweetened i am guessing that it is unsweetened on the fact that there is sugar in the recipe but i wanted to make sure thanks
5,very quick and easy very delicious
5,a great simple recipe with very tasty results i used the original recipe the first time i made them and they were a little eggy for us i used egg white and a cup of sugar the second time and they came out just as good so if youre looking to cut back on the sugar thats a good option
5,these were so simple to make and so delicious i will probably try adding some slivered almonds or drizzling some chocolate on top next time to dress them up a little but they are fantastic even with out
5,just made a batch of these for my kids and i i added some cocoa to some of them they are all excellent thanks for the recipe
5,great macaroons and so easy just make sure that you use parchment paper with these or they will run and stick
5,omg i had very high expectations and these cookies exceeded them ive never made macaroons before and my absolute favorites are sold at juliennes restaurant i made this recipe exactly as stated and they were perfect i did use parchment paper as recommended i also lightly beated the egg whites and vanilla to just blend then added them to the dry coconut mixture i used a cookie scooper that a friend gave me many years ago and the size was perfect yielding exactly cookies like the recipe states the egg whites never ran i did leave the cookies in the oven for an extra minutes until they were more golden but not burnt oh the cookie scooper measures appx measuring tablespoon i loved them and will add to my recipe keepers
5,ive never tried this but it sounds soooo good im going to make it tonight as a test run before the holidays are on us thanks for the idea
5,i did increase the potatoes and decreased the sour cream other than that love that i can make this the night before and pop it in the oven the day im serving it
5,so good used mini potatoes and just parboiled them first
5,i love this recipe because baked potatoes are so versatile i tweaked it to make it a meal cooked the potatoes in the crockpot while at work i added cubed ham and used cheddarjack cheese we added the sour cream and chives after baking it was a satisfying meal that was so easy i hope the remainder freezes well since we are empty nesters
5,i found this in toh ultimate cookie collection cookbook pg these are fantastic the only thing i do a lil different is i add some chopped pecans to them mix before baking awesome with or without so soft and moist i noticed another reader asked and i will say i did not beat my eggwhites previous to putting them in the bowl i simply mixed it exactly how the directions say i used medium speed on a stand mixer for a couple minutes till it looked good if you let the mix sit for too long though make sure you stir it before spooning them out as the sugar and liquid tends to sit on the bottom of the bowl also my cookies did have some liquid spreading but it was good stuff i baked them till they were very lightly brown on top and golden brown at the very bottom edge i used parchment paper and never greased it once and used it for a quadruple batch as i make my cookies bigger than everyone else i found this recipe didnt make many cookes my newest macaroon recipe and its a forever keeper
5,these were awesomejust the right amount of crispiness on the outside and chewiness on the inside i omitted the pecans because i didnt have any and they were still delicious didnt beat the egg whites i think the recipe size was perfect if you are someone who tracks your portion sizes then this recipe will make more than enough
5,this recipe didnt call for pecans
5,note the picture shows the macaroons as much larger than the suggested rounded teaspoonful i didnt much care for such small macaroons so when i make them again they will be closer to the size indicated in the photographhowever they tasted great i have no problem with the flavor
5,this was a quick and easy recipe and absolutely delicious i will absolutely make this recipe again
5,this is the recipe ive been looking for as mcheleclow has said dont need concensed milk very goood by the way the batch does need to be doubled when you cook the recipe the first batch i cook as according to the recipe they were excellent but the egg white seem to run out of the cookie the next batch i beat the egg white slightly and added a little coconut flavoring alone with the vanilla they came out perfect and tasted a little better this is a delicious cookie the first batch i removed from the oven hour ago and my husband has eaten almost half of the first batch
5,these were lovely i made a batch for my sewing group they love macaroons and they said that they were wonderful my husband hates coconut and he ate would make again for any one who loves coconut sent the recipe to my sister and best friend
5,such an easy recipe and without condensed milk its a snap i added an extra tbsp of flour to avoid the liquid spreading at the bottom they are perfect this is my new go to recipe
5,easy amp good i did whip the egg whites i got dz ping pong ball size macaroons
5,i followed this recipe exactly as instructed i didnt beat the egg whites i didnt add chocolate or pecans or any other bells and whistles the macaroons were crunchy around the edges fluffy and moist on the inside and simply delicious i mixed everything rapidly in a little bowl by hand and popped the dollops into the oven for minutes hey presto macaroons that would give earth fares a run for their money my husband loved them thank you so much for sharing this you deserve that firstplace ribbon
5,i added one more small can of chilies only the salt switched out the whipping cream for ff half and half but to keep the thickness i added some dark ale and cornstarch mixture to it this is a keeper
5,flavorful and creamy loved the variation from regular chili
5,this was superb i was really easy to make too i highly recommend it
5,oh my goshthis is not only one of the easiest recipes i have madebut also one of the yummiest love it also a great way to use left over turkey
5,very easy and very delicious this is a keeper folks next time may add some mushrooms and red bell pepper to bulk it up a littlebut dont have to
5,this is a great recipe i wish i had a contet to enter it in the next i have a craving for chili ill make this mmm mmm good
5,this is one of the best white chili recipes i have found i made it for a dinner party where one of the people is a very good chef she thought this was so good and requested the recipe
5,i tried this on my family and my daycare girls and they all loved it and want it again
5,ive never made white chili before and wanted something different for our church chili cookoff made this recipe and won st place excellent and very easy to put together i made it in advance but did not add the sour cream and whipping cream about minutes before serving time i added the two ingredients and heated through ymmmm
5,this is a family favorite i use canned chicken reduce the broth and add a can of corn perfect with hot cornbread
5,quick and easy to make my family asks for it all the time i dont add the green chiles instead i use ghost chiles a very small amount adds a lot of heat and a wonderful smoky flavor delicious
5,this was so good the only thing i would do is leave out the salt and use lower sodium broth it was great just too salty
5,wonderful recipe i used oz light cream cheese instead of the cream cuts way down on the fat
5,family loved ithad to add it to the recipe box immediately
5,before i made this i read all the reviews based on those i added large potatoes and cut the quantity of sour cream in half the dish was perfect with those changes
5,i done alot of changes to fit my weird eating habits i mixed the salt amp black pepper gether so it measured out to t i used low sodium bacon bits or crumbles used a mexican blend of cheeses added red amp green bell peppers diced and added the bottom s of the green onions to the casserole sprinkled more of the green onions toppings to the potatoes every loved it will b making it again for sure
5,every time i make this my motherinlaw tries to lick the pan so very good
5,a great dish without all the work made it for potluck and it was gone before i knew it
5,i first made this recipe several years ago the version i printed back then simply stated medium potatoes when converting my recipes from paper to electronic i noticed the potato type and quantity has changed now being lbs red potatoes medium russet potatoes are definitely different in mass to lbs red potatoes i did try and the red potato quantity is certainly not sufficient for the quantity of other ingredients in the recipe if quantities are balanced more appropriately recipe is wonderful
5,i have made this recipe several times exactly as it states to the peoplethat dont approve of this recipe all i can say is that you much not likea loaded potato this is simply a huge loaded potato its wonderfulif you dont have enough potato choose larger potatoes my potatoesare probably medlg if you havent tried the recipe you might besurprised to find out that all the ingredients really work try it thanks taste of home you do a great job
5,ive made this many times and agree with a previous commenter the amount of potato has been changed i use russets well scrubbed with skins left on because i prefer a starchy potato for this dish and use about lbs we get about decent sized portions skimpy portions are not permitted in my kitchen i prefer to cube the potatoes and roast them in a large baking dish before hand i also double the amount of salt and black pepper to tsp twice baked potatoes are a favorite of both my husband and me and this casserole hits the spot
5,i love twice baked potatoes so this casserole is definitely one ill try i know ahead of time that i wont use the amount of sour cream called for due to past experience of the overpowering taste when ive made twice baked potatoes my solution to that is to substitute french onion chip dip for a portion of the sour cream not only does it eliminate the sour cream aftertaste but it adds a nice flavor to the potatoes its a simple easy solution
5,i tried this recipe out for my extended family and they loved it now they are asking for the recipe i did add a little extra potatoes to the mixture but wouldnt change anything else about it it was awesome
5,i made this for a pot luck at workit was the first to go yummy is all i heard for the rest of the day will make again
5,love this recipe making it for a th of july picnic
5,this casserole was easy to make and very good the flavors were great i would definitely make it again
5,excellent my husband amp i really enjoyed this casserole i had baked potatoes in frig so it only took a few mins to heat up
5,i made this recipe for thanksgiving dinner i asked how does it taste and my husband said awesome i baked the red potatoes for minutes on degrees and used the amount of cheese
5,for all of you who loved this recipe but hated the prep time put your potatoes in a plastic grocery bag tie it loosely and microwave id say about to minute for large baking potatoes or minutes for medium red potatoes check them half way through so you dont over cook and adjust time accordingly you can do this the day before and just stick them in the frig till your ready to make your casserole this is what i did for this recipe love the recipe and this will be a keeper thank you
5,this is one of those recipes you better only make for people you like its amazingly delicious and whomever you make it for will keep coming back for more cheesy goodness with bacon and onions too whats not to love its a great one for grilled meals in the summer goes well with steak or chicken and feeds a crowd too
5,i made this for my inlaws one night for supper wow they loved it my husband said make sure you make it again it really is a great tasting potato recipe love it
5,great side dish i adjusted some sour cream but i added some butter definitely will be made again soon
5,very pretty dish very delicious the mixture of cheeses bacon and green onions cant be beat
5,very good recipe very easy to make and was delicious needed more than potatoes for a x pan i ended up using or medium sizewhich and was over lbs
5,wow everyone couldnt stop talking about this dish i used oz light sour cream and lowfat cheese and it was terrific it reminded people of outbacks cheesy fries
5,ive made this a few times now and everyone has loved it i didnt use as much sour cream as it called for because it seemed a little much
5,used the original recipe of using baking potatoes and loved it served this at my sons wedding reception it was a hugh hit
5,have been making this dish for our christmas gathering for a number of years now everyone loves it so easy too
5,excellent we doubled the potatoes and left everything else the same and it was perfect
5,i wasnt sure how the family would like the new recipe so made a pan of the old cheesy potatoes and one of this recipe it was superb everyone liked it i use the suggestion to simplify it by using frozen diced hash browns and used only cups sour cream i used the precooked bacon and it was wonderful saved me lots of time and both kinds of energy mine and the electrical type
5,we loved it it was worthy of leftovers and i dread having leftovers
5,just made half recipe and i would do it again it was easy and quick i did run out of sour cream but used french onion chip dip to make up the balance i needed to complete the amount of sour cream needed i did delete the onion because of this the flavor was spot on
5,great recipe look folks good tasting food is fattening otherwise it wouldnt taste good make your own adjustments but dont bash the original recipe the ingredients are there for a reason
5,i doubled the amount of potatoes and then cut the original amount of everything else by and we loved them however my husband wants me to make them according to the recipe the next time either way we will be making them again
5,i made this recipe as is when my boyfriend saw the dish for just two of us he asked if he should invite the neighbors by the time we finished there was not enough left for the neighbors it was so good i like to try a lot of different recipes but this is one that my boyfriend has requested that i make again
5,i used the entire amt of potatoes but cut everything else in half it worked out great i also used a x pan definite hit
5,i cut the calories and fat way down by using nonfat sour cream and substituting nonfat skim evaporated milk for the heavy cream and it is still yummy a family favorite
5,so good i omitted the green chilies because we dont like a lot of heat and it was still zippy and tasty added cup frozen corn didnt have heavy cream so i used oz cream cheese instead also used cloves garlic in place of the garlic powder this is a wonderful cold weather meal
5,my guys loved this recipe ask for it on a regular basis now
5,this is the best white chicken chili i have ever had
5,this is my new go to recipe i have already emailed it tyvm for submitting it i added a little white winecilantro added c chicken brothas i added potatos at the end as i roasted a spiced up chickenpotatos the night before for supper then used that in this recipe chipolte peppers would be a nice change also
5,ive made this twice this week its great
5,so good i make this about once a week during the winter time
5,i made this for my husband and a friend and they both loved it i only used one can of green chilies and i omitted the onions i added drops of potent hot sauce at the end as well it says it yields servings but i would say this comfortably feeds only people
5,very good my family loves
5,ive made this recipe many times for family and friends always a huge hiteven with the pickiest of eaters i do omit the whipping cream as it gives the chili a sweeter tasteand a lot more fat and calories i also put shredded cheese cilantro and lime on top
5,i have always enjoyed white chili since it doesnt have the acid that is in regular chili my friends here in indiana would always say whats that then i began sharing this recipe one told me all she could do was smile with every bite i agree i just love the creaminess and the just right spices i see why it is contest winning
5,i have been making this chili for years everyone who tastes it asks for the recipe fantastic
5,hands down one of the best soups weve ever had the only thing we changed was adding one can of the green chilies instead of two my nine year old couldnt get enough
5,got this recipe from my sister last year and i have made it many many times and even put some in the freezer it is sooooo good and everyone i have ever fixed it for wants the recipe i have even made it for a friend that has to count sodium intake i used no salt broth and seasoned myself best chicken chili recipe ever
5,made this for the first time tonight and it was a hit will definitely make it a regular i added my green onions with the bacon in the layers instead of just topping it with them this could also be kicked up a notch with some jalapenos
5,really good tastes just like a fantastic baked potato with all the fixins enjoy
5,our family loved this however i did make a few changes i used about of the sour cream light half bacon half turkey bacon reduced fat cheese and a little bit of cream of mushroom soup about cup it was creamy and very tasty will make again and probably add some crushed red pepper flakes and maybe a dash of hot sauce we love hot in our home
5,added chives and sprinkled with garlic salt excellent
5,i used about half the amount of sour cream and it was fine everyone love it
5,this recipe is a big hit with my family and me it is easy to reheat and carry in lunches unlike twice baked potatoes
5,amazing casserole
5,i used ranch dressing in place of the sour cream the family loved it
5,this is my absolute favorite potato casserole recipe of all time ive made it on many occasions with fabulous results
5,fabulous i receive tons of raves with this i mixed it all together instead of layering it and then put it in my crockpot and cooked on low my crockpot runs pretty hot for four hours i buttered my crockpot really well first and that seemed to help keep it from sticking too bad i took it to the party and left the crockpot on warm for several hours and it worked out just fine everyone said that id have to make that everytime we get together and no one even guessed or realized that it was gluten free a true feat for us celiacs note its also a meal unto itself so as a celiac at a social function you know you can have a full meal in just the one safe dish
5,this is an awesome recipe i have made this twice once with no bacon because my wife hates it and the second time with several modifications to sort of make it my own it was great both times but i really hit a homerun by adding both pound bacon and pound flavored chicken sausage i also used a blend of feta sharp cheddar and sheep cheese which made it even creamier and extremely addictive i also spruced it up with a few additional spices lots of garlic like another reviewer stated they did i mixed all of the ingredients together as opposed to layering and then topped the casserole off with bread crumbs this recipe is a must try and if you like to play around with the flavors like i do it is a fantastic starting point for making an absolutely amazing casserole
5,i saw this recipe years ago in the quick cooking magazine i have been making it ever since as it is a family favoriteits often requested by the kids for their birthday dinner
5,absolutely delicious instead of layering i just laid all the potatoes in the dish and spread the sour cream over the potatoes sprinkled onion and bacon salted and peppered then sprinkled cheeses on the top came out great definitely a new family favorite
5,this is a family favorite weve been making this recipe since it first came out the regular recipe didnt specify red potatoes so we have always used russets its a staple at our holiday dinners we love it
5,this is wondeerful on a cold day
5,we have made this recipe several times the entire family loves it
5,awesome and delicious best part is sour cream can be left out and it can be topped with ranch once its done
5,yes love it and it taste great with ranch dressing drizzled on top when its done
5,incredibly good
5,my family loved this chili even my two picky boys ate it up my husband was vocally disappointed when the last of the leftovers was gone and he has never done that before over leftovers of anything i will be making this again often
5,this is one of my husbands favorites and i make it on a regular basis during the colder months which is almost all of them here in oregon i usually reduce the jalapenos and pepper for my daughter and i who cant handle a lot of spices we top it with onions and shredded cheese and serve with cornbread yum
5,great recipe so easy to make and so full of flavor this recipe is a keeper
5,wow my family loved this even my picky eaters my husband said its so good it could win a contest i even had to substitute a couple items and it still turned out incredible thank you for the star recipes renae
5,this recipe won my chili cookoff at work today d i added pound of ground chicken spiced it up a little more and used potato flakes to thicken it up a little and it was perfect glad to see this is a contest winner on the site as it was in my office as well
5,doubled this recipe for a dinner at work raves
5,terrific and easy
5,made a double batch for a work luncheon they ate the whole thing even though there were soups and it made a large crock pot full i mixed the everything together including the cream and sour cream before cooking in the crock pot on high for hours it turned out wonderful i also only added cans green chiles the recipe instead of double just so it wouldnt be too hot next time i will add all cans because although it had a kick it wasnt as much as i like i also did as others have recommended and used instant potato flakes to make it creamier definitely a keeper thanks for submitting it
5,very good i mashed up an extra can of beans to thicken a keeper
5,this is the most wonderful white chili i have made it over and over it is my families favorite i make it with the spiciness or without
5,served this to a friend just last night every time i make it people rave about it
5,i cut the recipe in half i didnt have fresh chicken on hand so drained a can of chicken yummy next time ill make the whoe recipe no leftovers
5,very tasty i made the mistake however in that i put too much broth in and it turned more into a soup then chili but it was still good and i will definitely try this again
5,this was so good and easy the only changes i made were to use a whole roasted chicken cut up and instead of whipping cream i used fat free half and half it turned out great
5,so good the only thing i added that was not on here was onions but i love this recipe
5,yummy just needed some tonys chachere
5,quick and simple and quite delicious we used a can of the diced jalapenos to increase the heat factor instead of the diced green chilies my husband put a layer of tortilla chips in his bowl first then ladled the soup on top my daughter and i ate it more like chips and dip its just delicious any way you want to enjoy it will be in our rotation
5,my family loves this recipe i make it regularly every couple of weeks and i get no complaints in fact i usually double the recipe because my roommate wants plenty of leftovers i accidentally added the taco seasoning in towards the end one time and it didnt seem to make much of a difference it was just slightly less flavorful but it was still good i usually add seasonings to the ground beef as i fry it and i put different beans in it but thats it it comes out delicious every time
5,i love this soup we like things a little on the spicier side so the only thing i do is use hamburger and chorizo and add black beans also i love black beans
5,delicious i used every ingredient and i wouldnt change a thing loved it
5,i made this for a crowd for my granddaughters christening luncheon it is so much easier to put everything in a large bowl and mix it together and then put into baking dish each and every morsel is coated and incredibly delicious
5,everybody loved this
5,fabulous i halved the recipe and added chopped smoked sausage for my husband and myself definitely one i will make again and again
5,this one is a keeper everyone requested the recipe i added more potatoes sprinkled some scallions throughout and cooked it a little longer just to make sure the cheeses melted throughout it not only tasted great but looked like the picture too they can be made up ahead of time and can also be reheated the next day if you have any leftovers
5,absolutely delicious have made this numerous times and the compliments just keep coming in so many savory flavors in one dish comfort food at its very best
5,very tasty but the original published recipe didnt call for red potatoes just med unpeeled potatoes i used regular baked potatoes and it worked just fine
5,i made this for christmas dinner and the entire family loved it i would absolutely make this again
5,i have made this soup lots of times everyone loves iti make exactly as is except i add a large can of sliced black olivestry it really makes a difference everyone always comments on the black olives and say they really love this addition
5,this soup is one of my favorites i added the black olives as was suggested by a reviewer and that was a win this will stay in the rotation of favorite meals we also topped it with cheese and sliced avocado
5,homerun i threw all of this plus a jalapeno into my slow cooker hours perfect soup with jalapeno cheese cornbread with very little clean up
5,this is a great recipe i make the soup for my family we all love it
5,i did it it was great
5,this taco soup was delicious i added hot chilies to it to make more spicy i also made vegetarian by using plant based crumbles instead of meat
5,i made this exactly as directed and it is delicious as is thank you for a wonderful recipe we are serving this with cornbread yum
5,loved this recipe and so did my husband and kids as a family of with very different tastes in food it can get complicated trying to satisfy everyone with the same meal but this taco soup is definitely going in my recipe book simple fast and delicious only alternatives i made was ground turkey instead of beef turkey chili with beans due to my teenage sons crohns amp my acid reflux and ranch style pinto beans instead of regular ty taste of home
5,love to take this recipe when going to visit the kids i do the cooking while visiting and this is a great first night meal quick and easy and so good i made the recipe as written
5,this is a quick yummy soup i made it as per written served with tortilla strips amp sour cream shredded cheese and guacamole for garnish
5,i really use this recipe a lot thanks
5,instead of a cans of chopped chilies and cans of stewed tomatoes just use cans of rotel they already have chilies and other seasonings
5,what do i do if i want the soup to be more in the pot
5,great soup i omitted the corn and the chilis since thats heartburn overload for all the whiners out there about the sodium intake everything listed is generally sold with a low sodium version at the store now believe me its not hard to find i also scratched the stewed tomatoes for diced will make this again
5,love this recipe not a fan of pinto beans so i leave those out and i use the petite diced tomatoes the kicker when we eat it add corn chips shredded cheese and sour cream omg making this right now it is nationaltacoday
5,this is so quick and easy to make especially for all of you working moms with school age children my family loved it
5,this was the most simplest taco soup recipe ive ever used i did not use both cans of beans because im not a fan but other than that the recipe was great
5,i made this recipe when we went to visit our kids and grandkids i browned the meat and took along with the other ingredients i made this for our supper the night we arrived so easy everything was open and add and the taste was incredible would totally prefer this over chili anyday add cornchips and sour cream and cheese so good
5,i made this soup and loved it so did the neighborshowever i used the crock pot had it on high for about hours and it was great i always think longer cooking brings out more flavor
5,delicious and super quick and easy
5,very good and very simple
5,tasted amazing i will be making this more often i added shreded cheese and chilli fritos as a topping
5,made this soup very good we had a soup day year ago made this it was a hit at my church very easy to make debbie
5,this is awesome and so easy eating now with garlic bread will be a staple from now on
5,this is one of the best soups ive ever eaten
5,decided to make this tonight for our family and two friends went to grocery store to buy the ingredients made this recipe and it was ready to serve all within minutes every person at the table loved this soup i doubled the recipe except for the kidney and black beans i still only used one can of each of those delicious so quick and easy this ones a keeper
5,first time to make this soup and it was a big hit i will be making again
5,this is great
5,this is a great recipe
5,wonderful flavor cook it all the time even in summer
5,taco soup is my all time favorite soup
5,this is easy to make and delicious i pretty much follow the recipe but am careful with the green chiles if you use rotel tomatoes with chilis you have enough spice as far as i am concerned usually the soup becomes spicier as it sits
5,this soup is wonderful i dont like stewed tomatoes so i just used a can of diced i didnt add the extra chiles either some may like a little more zing but i didnt want it to be too spicy serve with a little cheese and corn chips
5,i love this its fast and easy but i do things a lil different first off i use a slow cooker then i double the recipe so i can have left overs also i use the rotel with lime and cilantro instead of the the tomatoes and chilis also instead if water i use chicken stock or beef broth whichever i have handy try it i promise you will not regret it
5,the soup is supper easy our church does a fund raiser making soup and i have made this for the event and it was well received
5,this sometimes substituting ground turkey for beef is a favorite go to recipe in our kitchen cornbread made from our new favorite mix miracle maize found at walmart makes it a meal
5,ive made this before and its really good i updated it after awhile though because my husband likes thick soups so i add a can of refried beans in the mix
5,i love this recipe i have tweaked the recipe a little i dont add the ranch dressing mix and i do it without beans taste good on corn chips or tortilla chips i had some on elbow macaroni and it was good my husband loves it too
5,i love this recipe i double the batch and add an onion house full of boys that way we have leftovers for lunch add some tortilla chips and you are good to go
5,love it added a can of diced tomato and packets of taco seasoning mix
5,have not tried it yet but will tonight recheck your nutritional information it looks off compared to what i found
5,i had a friend make this at a get together and it was delicious she didnt drain any of the ingredients and neither do i i add my normal spices garlic onion tonys creole salt and pepper plus the ranch and taco season perfect fall and winter meal it was cooler in my area so i had to make it
5,looks great suggestion how about showing the directions using the instant pot
5,we love this on cooler nights we have even made it beforehand and taken it camping huge hit around the campfire we dont add the rotel or pinto beans instead we do petite diced tomatoes and tomato sauce we also do lite red and dark red kidney beans black beans and refried beans serve it with crushed up tortilla chips on the bottom of the bowl a sprinkle of shredded mexican blend cheese and a flour soft taco shell on the side great meal
5,everyone loves it
5,this is an easy and quick recipe that is great for the fall cool weather i only made substitutions for things i did not have on hand such as making my own ranch dressing mix replacing stewed tomatoes with diced tomatoes with onion powder and using chili hot beans instead of the drained pinto beans and can of green chilies if i had all of the ingredients on hand i wouldnt have changed anything
5,this is a great soup it is very flavorful and easy to prepare love the convenience
5,i didnt have the original ranch so substituted fiesta ranch and it was delicious
5,love this recipe however i usually only cook for my husband and i and neither one of us are a huge fan of the chunks of tomatoes to accommodate this i use a can of tomato juice and tomato sauce also we add chicken broth for extra flavor really gives it a warm and comforting taste
5,great recipe ive been making this for years love the ranch dressing in it i top each bowl with cheddar cheese avocado slices and tortilla chips
5,absolutely love this recipe got it years ago from a neighbor who made it for a baby shower
5,this chili is great the only changes i made i doubled the recipe used heavy cream and half amp half and added extra cans of green chilis my family really liked it but my son who doesnt like sour cream thought the sour cream flavor was too strong so next time i will cut the sour cream in half this recipe is definitely a keeper
5,this recipe is really good my picky brothers devoured it
5,i made a double batch of this but put in only half the chilies since we dont like spicy i also used a bulb of fresh garlic absolutely delicious
5,my fiance and i made this for the first time tonight and it was amazing it was a delicious balance of cream and spice we would recommend this to anyone
5,this recipe is very simple and tastes great i add a can of rotel and use one can of chilies delicious
5,very simple to make with great taste very nice change i made this in the crockpot all day on low amazing plan to make this for dinner with friends after christmas serice cant wait
5,this chili was a hit with adults and kids garnished with some grated mexican cheese and it made it cheesy licious the only thing i thought it lacked was some veggiesi thought maybe some frozen corn could be addednext time i will try that
5,this soup was a hit it was easy and quick to bring together the only thing i did different was add a fresh jalepeneo to the canned chillies i think it could benefit from some more veggies like corn the other thing i noted was that to me it seemed salty i think next time i make it i will cut back on the salt added and add some corn
5,made just as it said to was great husband even asked about it
5,made just as it said to was great husband even asked about it and said it was very good
5,this recipe is amazing i wanted a unique chili to enter in my first contest and i wont third place the top three chilis were very close in points and everyone was raving about this chili i didnt hear one person complain about it i doubled it because of entering it into a cookoff and i also added two jalepenos to give it a little bit of spice a for this recipe
5,this is great anyway but after making it at least times now i have some suggestions add an extra can of great n beans and thicken the soup with some cornstarch or flour use tillamook brand sour cream there is a huge difference ive tried both
5,first time ive made a white chili we loved it i used only one can of chilies and it was plenty of heat for us next time i may add another can of beans but it is thick enough with the just the two
5,very good followed the recipe except didnt add the cayenne which would have helped will next time
5,a great change really good
5,this is a great recipe i tweaked it by changing to lb sweet italian sausage and lb ground beef i also added addl cans of the stewed tomatoes and more cans of kidney beans along with can tomato paste cup sugar couple teasp crushed red pepper pinch of salt and pepper and finally some chopped garlic in oil and passed it off as chili at our work chili cookoff i won the contest so thank you for sharing
5,excellent recipe not only easy to make its quick and delicious
5,very good and simple i did add a chopped onion with the beef and added an extra cup of water i like it with more juice
5,one of my favorite coldweather soups the only change i made was using ground turkey instead of the beef other than that its perfect
5,easy to make and very flavorable did not add the pinto beans will make again
5,i made this soup days ago with only a couple changes lb each gr beef amp italian sausage with some onion and garlic powder cook with the meat i only added less than cup additional water than called for in the recipe and the soup is delicious we dont like a watery soup but prefer substance and this worked out well unlike some posts we liked the pinto beans in the soup
5,i have made this soup many times over the years my husband likes mixing pasta with it and calls it mexican goulash the kids like topping it with shredded cheese and sour cream to fab the additional of the packet of ranch salad dressing is included with stir in the remaining ingredients to woolyhobbies its obvious you havent made the soup and are only injecting your personal opinion about salt consumption why dont you create your own low sodium version and post it to be reviewed i appreciate the reviews and comments from those who actually made the dish and gave an honest opinion there are some great suggestions given for variations that make this a very versatile recipe
5,absolutely loved quick very easy will make again
5,i make this often and as with many recipes i make changes such as adding an onion and not draining the corn before adding it sometimes i pour it over rice or pasta and top it with shredded cheese its even better the next day and kids like to use tortilla chips as edible spoons
5,we loved this soup tonight it has been a dreary overcast day and this soup was perfect comfort food i followed the recipe exactly and we have some left over for lunch tomorrow i highly recommend this recipevolunteer field editor
5,the taco seasoning amp ranch make this recipe i use veggie broth instead of water i add green beans i use diced flat iron steak not ground beef i also use black beans instead of chili beans i drain everything except tomatoes adding ur favorite salsa is awesome too
5,it taste so good
5,very simple and delicious my mom is on a low sodium diet so we used old el paso less sodium taco seasoning i also used reduced sodium pinto beans and no salt canned corn and stewed tomatoes didnt compromise on taste at all served it with sour cream sliced black olives and reduced fat shreaded cheddar cheese as toppings family loved it my picky eaters thanks for sharing this recipe its a winner
5,this is my dads favorite soup and we all like even the picky eaters in the family i found this recipe recently and he has requested it times so far i did make some adjustments i melted some cheese and half and half in to it but it tastes just fine with out it
5,i love this soup but i use packets of the spicy taco seasoning a cup of rice and add cups of water instead of due to the rice soaking up the water also sprinkle taco cheese on top and sliced black olives when served
5,this is a delicious recipe i especially love it because its quick
5,this was easy and tasty i had hamburger and chorizo already cooked from a previous meal so it came together fast i did add some chopped onion and beef base for a richer flavor i will make this again
5,my husband loved it ill serve it at our next small group from church in weeks
5,i added chopped onion and garlic when browning the ground beef drained it i added can of northern white chili beans instead of pinto beans i didnt add the can of chiles the diced tomatoes and chiles where plenty hot enough i added cup of rice and cups water put a dash of red pepper and sugar and salsa then added colbymonteray jack cheese to cut the spice down
5,havent made this yet but as im raising grandchildren and always on the hunt for good simple and easyi will be happy to try itadding garlic and onions seems logical to mecome to think aboutadding garlic and onions to anything containing ground meat sounds like it should be etched in granitep
5,my whole family and my girl scout troop all love this soup you can control how spicy it is and the girls especially love adding cheese chips tomatoes some even like to put lettuce on top its a staple in my house and on girl scout overnights
5,has anyone ever made this in a crockpot just putting it all together and slow cooking for a few hours wanting to do that today on this rainy day
5,taco chilli is one of my favorites except i make mine with black beans ground turkey and no stewing tomotoesawesome
5,simple easy and very good tasting the only change i made was to use diced tomatos instead of stewed tomatoes
5,i used to make these with ricearoni all the time and now i can just use plain rice in my pantry i used ground chicken instead of ground beef because we dont eat beef the tomato sauce was so delicious i served homemade mac and cheese with it and it made one of the best meals i have had in a while my husband loved it
5,i always called these stuffed peppers without the peppers i made them with tomato soup
5,a great old timer recipe my mom made the and i use to make them for my kids the other night i was talking with my son and as what he was doing he said he was making porcupine meatballs the tradition is carried on
5,was easy to make and yummy next time i would had seasoning to the hamburger for more flavor
5,absolutely a keeper my two kids are the worlds pickiest eaters ever and they absolutely love these i made them exactly to recipe thanks for sharing this we love it
5,normally i cant eat anything spicy and even though this does have a kick to it if you add the oz of green chilies its not too bad however you can just leave that out if you choose
5,we love this soup it is so very easy and so delicious on a cold night all of the ingredients can be kept on hand for quick meal i have a friend who has made this with chicken with delicious results i have passed this recipe along to many
5,i first made this a few years ago when it first came out in the magazine carried it to work and they ask for it so much that its unbelievable
5,this is truly a simple delicious soup my pickiest eater says its her favorite food ever
5,so easy very healthy amp extremely tasty definitely a winner with my family
5,this recipe was given to me by a friend i first made it for a soup and salad day at work it was such a hit i make it frequently at home as well
5,love this recipe i make it at least once every couple of weeks during the cold fall and winter months its quick to prepare and the leftovers are just as good if not better my family also likes to add shredded cheese and tortilla chips on top yummy
5,great soup all family members love it from young to the very old
5,very easy and tasty freezes well too
5,theres another white chicken chili from taste of home that i usually make that is done in the crockpot and starts with a jar of alfredo sauce i decided to make this one because i wanted something that i could make quickly that didnt have to cook all day this tasted similar and we really liked it because it was quick i think i will double next time for more leftovers
5,this was definitely a hit i didnt use the heavy cream at all i only used the sour cream and i added a can of mushrooms also i have to wonder if it is coming out different for people that live in different places i live in southern new mexico we are in the desert and elevated like ft it wasnt thin for me nice and creamy and delish
5,this is my first time to make a white chili this is wonderful it is so easy to make i used an already roasted chicken from the deli and also added a can of mushrooms everything else i kept the samei made some honey beer bread to go with it what and awesome dinner the wine was good too
5,this one was a hit with all the family i used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream and didnt add sour cream during cooking everyone added their own sour cream at the table
5,i made it for our staff lunch it was really good thanks for the recipe
5,my husband and i love this instead of cayenne and green chilis i use a can of rotel it comes out great
5,very good simple amp quick white chili recipe i added tsp of cinnamon
5,so delicious the only thing i changed was i added a can of corn and i only used can of green chilies
5,will do this againexcept next time i will use more beans very tasty just a trifle thin for us mushrooms sound like a good idea too
5,my family loves this recipe i altered it and added corn starch to make it a bit thicker plus we use crushed tortilla chips on top as a garnish
5,i made this with low calorie fat free substitutes and it was great whole family enjoyed family of ate all of it would make a side salad to go with it next time
5,extremely tasty easy to make will make again
5,i have never made white chili before and i was sceptical to try this i am so glad i did my entire family loved this i cooked my chicken lightly in my skillet with oniongarlic but then instead of cooking it all on the stove i put it over into my crockpot with all of the other ingredients i started this in the morning on high and it was ready in hours i chose this method because i am a busy mom and i like to start my meals in the morning and then have all the prep work done for me i served this up with some cajun bread and we had a wonderful lunch thank you for another wonderful recipe taste of home will be making this one again
5,this was wonderful i served it up with some cajun bread and everyone loved it
5,very good recipeeasy to make
5,ive made this for years learned from my mom we make extra sauce snd use it over mashed potatoes or we wedge some cabbage lay it on top of the meatballs snd pour the sauce over it all family favorite for sure
5,wowtakes me back to mom made this a bunch make that grub go as far as you could
5,my family simply uses a large can of campbells tomato soup versus the sauce sugar worchestershire and its very yummy
5,these turned out perfectly the only adjustment i made was to the sauce i omitted the sugar threw in a few of the chopped onions and increased the worcestershire sauce to a tablespoon the rice will cook through if you match it with the same amount of water in the meatballs as called for in the recipe delicious will be making again
5,a great oldy but goody recipe left out the water because i used leftover rice that was already cooked
5,i think i would caramelize the onions when making the recipe but that does look delicious i always served mine with extra rice
5,my mom made these when i was growing up and she used a can of vegetable juice and put flour on outside the balls and brought vegetable juice to a boil and added the balls in and the flour thickened the sauce i do it the same way
5,i made this for my kids when they were growing up and it was this exact recipe they always loved it however i do use minute rice in the recipe delicious
5,as per other comments my mom made these for our family when i was growing up she did not serve them with rice but she wouldnt cook them in a deeper dutch oven and towards the end of cooking would cut up a green cabbage and cut the quarters into halves and place those pieces all around the meatballs and down into the tomato sauce i remember just hearing contented sighs slurps and mmms at the dinner table no talking i need to make this for my family since i havent done it in a long time thank you for the memory
5,have been making a variation of this for years called swedish porcupine meatballs using minute rice and substituting cream of celery or cream of mushroom soup for the tomato sauce with rice as a side dish
5,i make porcupine meatballs using cream of mushroom and cream of celery soups makes a wonderful gravy i do cook my rice first tho
5,our family loves these we always use beef ricearoni and a egg to help hold in all together it turns out great and is delicious
5,we had these growing up too but they were always part of my moms stuffed pepper recipe i suspect we children didnt like the pepper part also i remember her tucking the meatballs in around the peppers to cook it was a way also to use up the extra stuffing after the peppers were stuffed
5,i followed this recipe except i used can campbells soup a small can of tomato sauce and omitted the sugar turned out delicious i will make again
5,i had some doubts while making this recipe exactly as directed as the meatballs were a bit mushy might use less water next time and a bit difficult to saute but after cooking them in the sauce they were fantastic anything you would like to add to the sauce will be absorbed by the rice and increase the flavor garlic hot sauce a bit of parmesian the other half and a guest unexpected raved about them and asked for seconds this is definitely on my regular rotation for meals thank you so much for the recipe
5,great recipewill be making these more often for the grand babies
5,tripled the recipe for a family dinner and it tasted so good i used what we had at home so the sauce was a jar or spaghetti sauce and tomato paste with equal parts water then we also added two eggs they were awesome would make again
5,awesome recipe super goodfor those who have crunchy riceuniform meatball size try using a cookie scoop andor forgetting the water are your likely culprits this will work very well every time as written
5,this recipe is elevated from a star to a star with the following tweaks first i only use c water in the meat mixture and add an egg to help bind the ingredients when mixing otherwise they tend to fall apart i use a quick rice also i microwave the onion in a tsp of water for minutes before mixing in with rest of ingredients most importantly i make times the sauce by increasing all of the ingredients by except the water which i leave at c i use italian seasoned tomato sauce this way we have plenty of sauce as we like to enjoy this dish over mashed potatoes ps remember to cover the dish while cooking or your rice may not get done i made this mistake the first time i made them many years ago
5,i am making this for the nd time it is so delicious i didnt change a thing my yr grandson even liked them and he only eats ground beef between a bun all the amounts were listed just enough spice thank you
5,family favorite for many many years easy and delicious sure to please a group of fussy people
5,i made them they were so good i could hardly put my plate down it was a big hit with my family
5,my mom always made these and we all loved them for people complaining about the rice being to hard there is a trick my mom used and i do too put the rice in a bowl and cover with the cup water and let it sit for at least minsi usually get everything else ready and by that time the mins is almost up that will soften the rice a little and make it cook better we use that trick for making stuffed peppers also
5,i use quick cooking rice instead of long grain ive been making this for years and with that type of rice you wont have the crunchy rice issue its a favorite of mine and coworkers including the glutenfree ones since it doesnt have bread crumbs like many meatball recipes the sauce is good and you can always add more seasonings to your tastes the sauce reminds me of a much tastier version of the spaghettios sauce i loved as a kid
5,i used precooked rice and made my meatballs by the recipe but immediately thought they would never hold together another reviewer suggested adding an egg and some bread crumbs so i dumped the meat mixture back together included the additions and it worked out like a charm this is a really wonderful recipe thanks so much for sharing it
5,a simple recipe and very good taste no problems making for me
5,this was excellent didnt need eggs to bind the water helped bind everything delicious
5,i have been making these since i was a bride years ago they are a family favorite i use calrose rice as that is what we keep on hand for everything it is very simple and easy i generally dont use any additional ingredients and have never had a problem with the rice not cooking it is very soft but will hold together if carefully browned if that is too hard then baking the meatballs might be simple we love the moist tender texture
5,so glad to see another recipe from my mothers kitchen this is a great recipe and method my mother used her pressure cooker that cooks the rice thoroughly too
5,my beloved grama used to make these she passed away in she put her meatballs in tomato soup with some milk she only used chopped onion rice s
5,this used to be my go to recipe when i st got married back in the recipe was in my betty crocker recipe cards
5,one of my favorites as a kid my mother used tomato soup instead of tomato sauce to make it extra appealing to us kids
5,ive made these for years family loves them i place cabbage wedges on top of the meatballs and pour the sauce over all i ended up with undone cabbage rolls
5,my family likes these meatballs a lot i serve them with more rice which they think is funny but hey you gotta fill up those boys somehow i put them in the oven for about min instead of browning them in a skillet then continue as the recipe says
5,these took me back to my childhood tasty and warmcozy feeling to eat scaryfascinating to look at even though i used marinara instead of homemade sauce they were great also as leftovers
5,this is a family favorite for us has been since it was published in the cookbook many moons ago my teen kids and inlaws when visiting request it often the only thing i do different is omit the brown sugar sometimes thanks for the recipe
5,my mom used to make these back in the s they are just as good as i remember
5,i make these with milk instead of water and omit the brown sugar i brown them and put them in pressure cooker for minutes i got a pressure cooker yrs ago so i could make these for my husband
5,good recipe followed it exactly mixture was not holding together like i wanted so i did add an egg and some bread crumbs that did the trick
5,fabulous i followed your recipe exactly except doubled and added a can of rotel and one can of tomato sauce soooo delicious and easy thank you
5,my family loves these meatballs we have them once a month at least
5,very good easy pleasy recipe im thinking for the people that the rice didnt get done the meatballs were probably to big will make this again
5,this recipe is so good i have finally found one from my childhood my go to meatball recipe now thanks so much for sharing
5,this is a fantastic recipe id been craving porcupine meatballs a memory from childhood i also babysit my greatgrandson once a week and wanted something for lunch that might appeal to a year old i followed the instructions to the letter except for the celery salt i had some but i couldnt remember how old it was so i omitted that ingredient the meatballs were perfectthe rice perfectly cooked and the sauce was thick and savory i only meant to sample them as they are to be our lunch tomorrow i put three on a saucer and ended up going back for three more im actually tempted to go back a rd time ive copied the recipe and added it to my notebook of favorites someone suggested that the ones who complained of undercooked rice might have made the meatballs too big i simmered mine exactly an hour and the rice was just right
5,it was wonderful my husband for the first time since weve been married went back for thirds this is definitely a keeper we have only been married for two months im a vegetarian so i dont taste his dishes with meat in them i could tell this was going to be delish because of the yummy aroma and it was very easy yet looked as if i had been cooking all day thanks
5,i first made this recipe around years ago everyone that eats these always wants the recipe my boyfriend will do anything that needs done around the house when i serve him these with a nice fresh salad garlic bread amp some sweet tea lol best of all i dont even have to ask him came here today to get the recipe because im making them for him tonight he is gonna be so pleased to walk in from work smelling the deliciousness as he enters the door my mouth is watering just thinking about them simmering mmm mmm please do not hesitate on trying this recipe ladies and gents you will not be disappointed i promise yathank you so much for the recipe darlis youre an angel im in wisconsin too lived down south the first time i made these again i cannot thank you enough for this incredible recipe you rock darlis

5,we enjoyed these tasty meatballs easy to make and i like the fact that you can fix the rest of the meal while they are simmering
5,i make these all the time for my family and they always turn out great i like to serve them with mashed potatoes and corn
5,i love these i have been making them for my family for years i use celery seed instead of celery salt when i double the recipe i only use the tsp of salt i also bake the meatballs drain then pour the sauce over the meatballs bake minutes more
5,delicious and easy to make
5,ive loved these since my grandma made them for me when i was a little girl years ago ive made them often in my life but usually make the sauce from cream of mushroom soup with about can of milk or water and a couple drops of worcestershire added to make it even easier and the way my grandma did it is to not brown the meatballs mix the meatball ingredients shape into meatballs and put in an even layer in a casserole dish and pour the soup mixture over cook at covered for minutes remove cover and cook for more minutes then i put them on top of mashed potatoes spoon sauce over all and enjoy its fun to watch peoples faces when you tell them youre serving porcupines too now im hungry for these and have to go make them for dinner
5,actually i had never heard of these before i made them today my husbands mother used to make them when he was little so i used this recipe and he loved it will definitely make again
5,i used this same recipe back in the s to stuff green peppers the extra meat became smaller porcupine meatballs its been years since ive made themmaybe tonight thanks for the reminder this is a great meal
5,my husband says this is a keeper easy to make and delicious
5,i live in ak and i made these with moose meat and oh my goodness it was so delicious the moose meat just absorbs all the flavors i will definitely be keeping and recommending this recipe
5,awesome been looking for this one
5,very good and so easy just like my mom used to make
5,i have attempted porcupine meatballs before and they always fall apart and or the rice doesnt cook i used this recipe and it worked like a charm i opted to bake the meatballs followed recipe but instead of using a pot placed in un greased baking dish and then covered in sauce baked at for minutes covered then uncovered and baked more minutes flipped balls to other side and splashed some sauce on top after minutes uncovered served with mashed potatoes and butter peas my one year old and husband loved this meal keeper
5,these are soooo yummy
5,thick and rich really enjoyed as an alternative to a traditional chili
5,i have made this recipe a number of times it is so easy to make and so delicious i have made it for family and friends it is awesome
5,we love soups and this one is terrific just enough bite to be interesting
5,my hubby absolutely loves this he requests it more than beef chili my yr old will eat this like its going out of style never any leftovers in our house
5,this is wonderful really quite easy to make and tastes delicious i love it
5,absolutely the best chili weve ever had i used rotisserie chicken which i added at the last minute and only used one oz can of green chiles oh my delicious
5,one of the best chili ive ever had
5,i have made this several times and always love the creamy chili on a cold day i replaced the whipping cream with canned evaporated milk skim is what i like caloriewise l also add can creamed corn and stir in monterey jack cheese with great results i top with light sour cream and chopped green onions serve with your favorite corn chips my family requests it all the time
5,perfectly delicious confirmed by my husband requesting leftovers for two more subsequent meals added cup kernel corn sprinkled cheese on top garnished with chopped tomato and a few dollops of guacamole beautiful and delicious
5,ive been looking for this recipe for years and am so glad to have found it it is delicious my friends loved it as much as i did this one will be made again and again love it
5,this was a big hit i made a few minor changes to fit my families taste without changing the essence of the recipe first of all my daughters do not care for green chilies so i used only one can i also pureed the green chilies along with the sauteed onions and garlic my daughters love the flavor of onions but not the texture secondly we adore the flavor of cilantro i use it as a flavor enhancer in the majority of soups so in this case i doubled the amount of cilantro additionally i added a quarter cup of rice my oldest doesnt like chili texture so because of this and the addition of the rice i used a ounce box of broth this gave it a chowder consistency that my daughter loved i used precooked roasted chicken so i added a light splash of lemon juice to cut the greasiness lastly to make it healthier i swapped evaporated milk for the heavy cream and plain greek yogurt for the sour cream all of the flavors of the original recipe is there and with the minor changes it has become a favorite of my oldest daughter
5,most of my family loved this i did make a few minor changes to adapt to my daughters taste while keeping the essence and taste of the recipe in tacti took a note from purplepentacle using fresh garlic along with toasting and grinding my own cumin seedsmy daughters do not like green chilies so i reduced it to one can they also love the taste but not the texture of onions because of this after sauteing the onion and garlic i pureed them along with the green chilieswe love cilantro and use it in most of my soups so i doubled the amount usedi added cup of rice my daughter doesnt like the consistency of chili so because of this and the addition of the rice i used ounces of broth this gave it a chowder consistencyto make it healthier i used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream and plain greek yogurt rather than sour creami was in a hurry so i used a store bought roasted chicken i added a splash of lemon juice to cut the greasiness of the chickeni served it in small bread bowls it was very stick to your ribs and is now a favorite
5,absolutely delicious everyone loved it and will definitely be making it again
5,absolutely delicious everyone loved it and had perfect flavoring making it again very soon
5,have made these many times inexpensive easy and delicious usually serve them over mashed potatoes i also usually double the sauce but i like the sauce to be a little less sweet so i dont double the brown sugar its a winner every time i serve it thanks for sharing this great recipe
5,this is tops in comfort food i have to admit that the first time in my married life i did not have tomato sauce on hand so i used petite diced tomatoes i already had on hand ran them through the blender and it worked very well these were even better as many tomatoey recipes are the next day as leftovers thanks so much this is just what i was looking for
5,i liked the recipe because i had everything on hand it did not take special ingredients my family loved it
5,yum my aunt makes something very similer to these and ive always loved hers these are good too
5,i have been making this ever since it appeared in your magazine years ago this is one of our most favorite meatball recipe the only thing i do different is add a little onion powder to the meatballs and i usually add a oz can of tomato sauce because we like extra sauce we love it withashed potatoes or potatoes i put through my river delicious we love the leftovers too
5,made this last night and the kids loved it my son kept asking for more and normally you have to beg him to just take one more bite i did make one change in the recipe my husband does not like his food to be sweet so instead of the brown sugar i added about teaspoon of ginger roughly i did not measure and i also made them in the pressure cooker without browning to save on time only had to cook them for min at lbs of pressure
5,when my youngest son was three he exclaimed ill have more delicious please it has been a requested birthday meal favorite of his ever since
5,my children loved making these meatballs i loved eating them no hard to slip brown rice into this one either
5,i love this recipe it reminds me of the meatballs my mom used to make when i was little the only change i made to it was i added tbsp of worcestershire instead of tsp and reduced the brown sugar to tbsp i really prefer a tangier sauce you can also add a little cayenne to give it a little kick otherwise this recipe is perfect
5,i have been making these for at least years or more they are really delicious i think they were in an old toh magazine
5,pcan you use almond milk instead of i dont know if it makes a difference or notp
5,this pudding was delicious i omitted the nutmeg only because i am not a nutmeg lover i served it with vanilla ice cream so yummy warm from the oven
5,these meatballs are great our family loves them we do substitute quickcooking oats for the long grain rice as oats are always in our cabinet but theyre perfect every time we make them truly a wonderful recipe to have
5,this has been a family favorite for years i make mine with lean ground turkey and i also make the baked mashed potatos which are delicious too this recipe was in a toh magazine that also include emilys spinach salad as a side with apple and raisensa very refreshing accompaniment to this meal yummy
5,oopsi meant spinach apple salad
5,delicious i didnt have celery salt so used seasoning salt did double the sauce as well everyone cleaned their plates
5,ive been making this recipe since it first appeared in your magazine there is nothing finer in the porcupine recipe area
5,my motherinlaw use to make this for my hubby and i when we first got together and i just loved it over the years i have been trying different recipes so i could make it myself i finally found a keeper my picky child ate every bit of it with no complaintsi took a few of the reviews and doubled the tomato sauce worcstershire sauce and brown sugar it was excellent served with rice and green beans since i doubled the sauce i served it over the rice very yummy and will make it again
5,just like the ones my mom use to make the whole family loves them and there is never any leftovers
5,delicious i like to forego the tomato sauce occasionally and use a mushroom gravy instead
5,my husband who usually doesnt like meatballs went back for seconds with these they are great
5,this is by far the best recipe i have ever gotten from taste of home this is my six year olds favorite mealand that says a lot since she is such a picky eater this would be a great dish for a potluck or for a meal to impress your friends family or coworkers
5,these were great meatballs with the rice in the meatballs and the tomato sauce it kind of reminded me of cabbage rolls without the cabbage i doubled the entire recipe and had just enough to feed two adolescent boys their father and myself
5,a good recipe i didnt change a thing these would even be good as a meatball sub with hot peppers and cheese this is a keeper
5,this is a very good recipe the only change i made was to add cut up green peppers to the sauce and since i was out of onions i replaced them with tablespoons of dried minced onion the dried onion added very nice flavor this recipe will make an excellent stuffed peppers recipe as well
5,i made the recipe with the ingredients and amounts exactly as listed i thought the topping was going to overfill my baking dish x pyrex after i poured about half of it in i was contemplating transferring everything to a larger pan but after waiting a few minutes the liquid had soaked in enough to add the entire remaining amount it is a must to let it cool off and set up or otherwise would have been soupy once cooled it is a great pudding consistency it is softer than a true cobbler but very good
5,its summer and the fruit is good so what do i do with all of that healthy fruit make desserts of course i bought some peaches yesterday and then went looking for a recipe to try im so glad i stumbled upon this one it turned out really well the only tweek i made was to follow the suggestions of sprinkling lemon and sugar on the peaches letting sit half and hour and using the bit of juice that accumulated in with the water part of the recipe i dont think it made that much difference so following spot on should come out just as well i didnt know what would happen with that water formula but the top got all brown and crunchy so good and this was really easy to whip together on a sunday afternoon i will definitely make this again
5,i am going to make this saturday sound great
5,i found this recipe a week ago and have made three times already my husbands favorite dessert by far and its so simple to make ive been buying fresh peaches for a week now ready for new dessert lol
5,this recipe is awesome i made it in the winter and used canned peaches and it turned out fabulous we did find it a little bit to sweet for our tastes and my diabetic father no big deal ill just cut back sugar next time
5,this is delicious i did heed another commenter and added less sugar my hubby is prediabetic so just used brown sugar for topping but my adult son was watching and he suggested i put a cookie sheet under it in the oven so glad i did
5,this is perfect just the way it is a definite keeper be sure to put something under the pan cause i now have to clean my oven
5,this was truly good but i changed one item i used pet milk instead instead of the milk i love it really really rich and this did the tick
5,wow this recipe is excellent i used glutenfree flour with great results the peach mixture is so sweet and loved the topping
5,made it for company tonight i served it warm with vanilla ice cream it was very good i freeze peaches during the summer when defrosted they give a lot of peach juice i used the peach juice instead of the water called for in the recipe to make the topping after reading other reviews saying it was too sweet i cut out the white sugar in the topping and used only the brown sugar my husband said it was as good as my peach pie its much less timeconsuming than making a pie so ill be making it again
5,this recipe is fantastic i cut both sugars to cup as were trying to decrease our sugar intake and it didnt change the taste at all it was plenty sweet and yummy with ice cream or cold milk
5,i made this tonight for dessert i seen the recipe a couple days ago and it made my mouth water it turned out pretty good
5,this recipe is so good i added cup chopped pecans to the top of the peaches before pouring the hot liquid over the top and baking it was not too sweet and the pecans gave it a bit of crunch i served it warm with vanilla ice cream at a dinner party with friends delicious
5,this was outstanding and so easy to make everyone loved it and it smelled wonderful baking served it with ice cream and with whipped cream both wonderful definitely a keeper
5,ollipday warm and delicious with cream poured over itplilipday not as good so eat it all the first daypliol
5,great tasting easy dessert made changes second time using canned peaches with juice since i ended up with fresh peaches that werent good saved the juice and used it in the topping with half amp half to make cups needed also used only the brown sugar amp two tablespoons butter instead of one with the nutmeg baked minutes in x pan amp no spillsturned out great served it warm with more half amp half it was more creamy than when i used water in the topping everyone loved it much faster using canned peaches amp still tasted great husband loves it both ways going to double recipe with glass x pan for labor day picnic amp bake it on my gas grill using an air bake cookie sheet under the cake pan so it wont burn thanks for a great recipe
5,my family raved about this recipe it is now a favorite i will definitely make this again and again
5,i made this tonight i only had canned peaches i drained and reserved the juice measuring out the juice to make cups added the brown sugar only it was amazing the dough was almost crunchy on top hubby licked his bowl clean my new fave
5,i made the recipe with only one slight change i sliced the peaches squeezed a little lemon juice amp sprinkled sugar amp let sit for minutes i drained the juice amp added it to the water i took it over to my neighbors amp her husband started eating it out if the pan they both said it was perfect it seemed a little off pouring the syrup over itit just worked amp turned out beautifully i put the pan under it thinking it may bubble over but it didnt great use of fresh peaches
5,wow is this good followed the recipe exactly except i didnt use quite all of the glaze was running out of room in the baking dish i was using i wouldnt change a thing
5,no adjustments needed on this one absolutely delicious
5,i made this for dessert with family it was delicious i used fresh peaches from the farmers market and this recipe did them justice the pudding was the right balance of everything and served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream it was fantastic i will make this over and over thanks
5,this dessert was so easy to make i made the recipe just as it is the only thing i changed was i used frozen peaches as that was all i had it turned out really really good i used a quart corningware dish instead of my x baking pan because i was afraid it would bubble over
5,this is a great easy to make recipe it is best with fresh peaches but still good with frozen also i found out it is best to serve the day you make it it is my goto recipe for a peach dessert
5,i want to try this recipe but dont know know whether vanilla ice cream would be used in place of or in addition to the halfandhalf cream in the recipe also how much halfandhalf cream should be used thanks
5,this is the recipe that our family has been using this for all the other cobblers that they made i am years young and i remember all family functions with were always just get together and everyone brought food i remember back to my greatgreat grandmother making it the water is what makes it it makes the crust so crispy and good
5,this is amazing i used frozen peaches from my last years crop so simple and the topping is so good comes out perfectlyserved with heavy cream and a sprinkling of cinnamon sugar great way to use my peacheswill definitely make again vfe
5,my son made this for me for mothers day we all thought it was fantastic he used frozen peaches from our last years crop he partially defrosted the peaches drained the juice and added it to the water he did not have an eight inch pan so he used a x he baked it on convect with a cookie sheet on the rack below as it bubbled over it came out beautiful and he served it with whipping cream it is a keeper
5,im dying at the review below by bob who subbed ingredients and then complained that it turned out bad this is a fantastic recipe when you have fresh peaches in the summer its probably good with frozen or canned peaches too but i save this for when i have fresh ones for the topping you need to let it boil for a bit and reduce before pouring on the batter think like syrup or even a caramel consistency i add a little corn syrup to the topping mix just to prevent any crunchy sugar bits the cream as indicated by the recipe is good but some ice cream i think is even better if you have fresh peaches this recipe is a musttry
5,this was great the only mod i made was using a x baking dish definitely a keeper
5,got some fresh peaches this week and looked for a recipe and found this one it was absolutely delicious had for dessert about hour after dinner and it was still warm and served with whipped cream definitely a keeper yummmm by the way i followed the recipe exactly except added more peaches about cups in all
5,delicious i used a combination of plums and nectarines i used half white half whole wheat flour and palm sugar ii agree it was delicious cold the next morning it was like a delicious compote with built in cake great way to use up stone fruit thats past its prime
5,love this first time i used white nectarines and it tasted great but looked a little bland used yellow peaches the next time and it was perfect i think i will use a few more peaches next time i make it as my husband says this is a keeper
5,i never thought this would work honestly i thought it would be too mushy and weird i was so wrong and im so glad i tried it the peachycake mixture cooked up nicely and the sweet topping made the dish just creamy enough i made my own whipped cream using coconut milk to serve and it was truly one of my favorite desserts i will be making this very often
5,excellent dessert served it with vanilla ice cream on top and it was delicious
5,great recipe add more peaches i used cups other than that follow the directions there is one mystery in this recipe it list half and half cream but doesnt tell how much or when to use it i left it out amazing will make many more times
5,this was extremely good as for the cream and when to use itthe last sentence states serve warm or cold with cream
5,i doubled all the ingredients and baked in a x pan it was full to the top but only boiled over a little thankfully i followed other reviewers suggestion and put a drip pan underneath i refrigerated overnight and then warmed the next day and served with vanilla ice cream spectacular i think chilling overnight helped firm it up and warming did not liquify it too much
5,i have been searching for a good peach cobbler recipe so many turn out like a cake with peaches in them dry not like i had growing up my husband brought some fresh palisade colorado peaches home this past weekend from his trip and i searched again for a recipe that was not dry i will search no farther this was perfect my husband loved it
5,this was really good it does boil over and thank you to the person who suggested setting it in a larger pan to catch the drips i think i will use a pan next time do serve it warm with the cream yummy to those readers who didnt know what to do with the cream you pour it over the pudding before you eat it would be good with ice cream too
5,wonderful recipe for a quick and easy dessert i only had canned peaches so i used two cans of peaches in their own juice i drained the juice and saved it it made one cup exactly so i used that to replace most of the water called for in the sauce you pour over the top it came together so fast and it was absolutely scrumptious
5,nothing like peach season in colorado i love finding ways to use up these large juicy peaches that are overflowing at the farmers markets we served this pudding with ice cream and it was a big hit
5,great flavor quick and easy i substituted cup of the water with peach liqueur for a little extra peach flavor after trying many other cobbler recipes my search is over
5,awesome i wasnt expecting this to taste sooo good great texture not to sweet for my taste i also added cream over the pudding that gave it that extravavoom i am in atlanta and i used the fresh ga peaches i bought from the grocery i used a deep casserole dish and had no spills in the oven just perfect my new go to peach pudding
5,wonderful
5,so good
5,love it on a cold night with rolls
5,this was excellent and a hit with the family this one is a keeper
5,this was excellent and it was a hit with the family
5,this was excellent and my family loved it its a keeper
5,this was excellent and a hit with my family i will definitely make this again
5,this was very good i will make it again
5,wow what great flavor and easy to make i cut back on the sour and heavy cream to reduce some of the calories and it was still great tasting
5,ive taken this to potlucks and always get rave reviews on it and requests for the recipe i love it
5,family loves it easy and tasty
5,love love love this recipe i double the broth for a soupier texture i have also served it without the sour cream and whipping cream some time i just called in a chicken green chili soup you can even add potatoes and call it a stew as a person that grew up in nm it is a taste of home love love love it
5,i tried this for dinner last night it was very good not too spicy i did not have whipping cream in the house so i served it without that in my opinion the sour cream really mellows and compliments the spices used hubs is not a spicy food lover but he cleaned his bowl and asked for more would definitely recommend this recipe thanks for sharing laura
5,love this chili im not a fan of red chili so this is perfect ive been asked to share this recipe many times over and its always a big hit
5,wanted some chili on this very cold winters day and this really hit the spot i used half lb of chicken breast and half lb of chicken italian sausage because that is what i had on hand it is fabulous the aroma got my sleepyhead son out of bed looking for food great with cornbread on the side
5,i made this cobbler for a family bbq using fresh peaches i followed the recipe exactly even thought it sounded crazy and it turned out phenomenal it was great with and or homemade whipped cream or both together everyone wants me to bring it again
5,ha ha ha did anyone notice the recipes name has pudding not cobbler in it maybe that had something to do with somes expectations whatever its marvelous
5,yummiliciousness
5,what a great way to use fresh peaches my husband and i have been trying recipes we can bake on the grill this recipe worked great
5,this is amazing followed the recipe exactly with no issues used x glass pan and it did not run over i had some frozen peaches and i used these left them out to thaw for about minutes and they were perfect i do believe i will replace the nutmeg with cinnamon the next time just not a big nutmeg fan thanks for sharing
5,this recipe was awesome i followed it exactly and it came out perfect i baked for the full minutes i added sparkling sugar on top and made it look extra special
5,delicious and very peachy i made this yesterday doubled the recipe and theres only a small portion left family loved it i used canned peaches and used the peach syrup in the topping along with the water to make the required amount of liquid and eliminated the granulated sugar from the topping cant wait to try it with fresh peaches great easy recipe a keeper for sure
5,this was excellent i did add more peaches my husband said it was a keeper i did add tsp almond extract to topping it was different than a cobbler but so good i will sure make it again many timesto the person who said they had trouble pealing peaches i learned a trick many years ago just put peaches in boiling water for about seconds than in cold water and the skin just peals right off i use to can bushels of peaches and that trick helped save a lot of time
5,this was fantastic i added nutmeg but otherwise followed recipe if you were to use apples instead of peaches it would taste like apple dumplings but way easier
5,this is a delicious way to use fresh peaches it comes together quickly doesnt use many ingredients and is really an impressive and comforting dessert i served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream but will try drizzling cream instead next time as the recipe suggests this will be a regular summer recipe for my family going forward i also like that it doesnt make a huge amountenough for company or a couple of nights of dessert for just my family
5,my husband and i absolutely loved this we did cut it in half because thats all the peaches we hadoriginally i was going to take the advice of other reviewers and back off on the topping especially since the peaches we had were very ripe and extremely juicy however i forgot to do that and instead just made it asis when it came out of the oven i was disappointed it was a big mess and there was definitely too much liquid i put all the leftovers in the fridge for another nightwhen i pulled them back out a couple days later i have to say that i fell in love with this dish it tastes a million times better cold and the cold actually helped it firm up it was no longer liquidy it reminded me of a delicious bread pudding almost i can understand why some people are disappointed but give this a chance asis if you dont like it then make adjustments for your next trial
5,oh my this was delish i had to improvise as some of my fresh peaches had gotten devoured without my knowledge so i added frozen berry mixture to make up the cups i made one tiny boo boo i plopped the brown sugar into the flour mixture i managed to scoop out most of it but i have to say it that little bit of brown sugar made the cobbler a nice brown and there was a delightful slight crunch it came out beautiful and everyone loved it served it warm with homemade french vanilla ice cream on top tdf
5,i just took it out of the oven and i can already tell this is a winner taking it to a church dinner todayi did modify the recipe just a bit i tripled the flour sugar milk and used cans of peaches i also used self rising flour i reserved the juice from the canned peaches using cups of the juice and only cup brown sugar and butter with a dash of cinnamon for the liquid topping
5,this is an answer to camsgram question regarding where cream is used im thinking it is used at serving time of the cobbler in the ingredients list it is half amp half cream in the directions it is referred to as cream on top of cold or hot cobbler im guessing it is poured on as desired it quite easily could be replaced with ice cream or a whipped topping hope this helps
5,i made this for a of july block party i doubled the ingredients and pour into a x pan i was out of nutmeg so i used pumpkin spice instead plus i put some spice into the flour as well came out wonderful i got lots of compliments on it
5,i dont bake much and when i do bake something it doesnt usually turn out very good this was the exception i made it exactly as the recipe stated except i used frozen peaches thawed i did think the topping was too much but used it anyway at the end of the cooking time it still was not done per the toothpick method i put it back in the oven and actually forgot about it im guessing it was half an hour later when i realized i had a cobbler in the oven i ran to the kitchen expecting to see smoke coming from the oven and a burnt cobbler inside but it was perfect a nice golden brown crust i was using a glass pan and it looked like it was soupy under the topping but after setting for a little bit the juice thickened up this tasted like a restaurant quality cobbler my year old mom raved about it she now thinks i can bake
5,my husband and i loved this i recommend this to my facebook friends would make this again
5,delicious my husband had helpings the top came out a perfect golden brown the only change i would make is maybe add a little more cinnamon for a stronger flavor
5,i made this for a family reunion recently and it was a tremendous hit used frozen peaches from our own tree and substituted the juice from the peaches for the water delicious
5,great dessert i will make this again as it was very easy to make i used only cinnamon for the mixture and the topping as we dont care for nutmeg the only trouble i ran into was that it bubbled over while in the oven so be sure there is a drip pan while baking
5,we had this last night for dessert and it was delicious i followed the recipe exactlydid cut down on the sugar in the topping to about a third cup of each the brown and white sugarsmaybe will reduce them down even more when i make this again and put it in an x inch baking dish it still bubbled over a bit i cant see why one person thought it had too many flaws and why some are so spooked by the fact that theres one and a half cups of water in the topping there are many dessert recipes where you use a lot of liquid like this to pour over the main part of the dessertit combines with the flour and creates that lovely thick sauce that was underneath the cakelike topping and peaches someone even contemplated leaving the topping offthat would be disastrous follow the recipe as its written use nice juicy ripe peaches and it makes a terrific cobbler of course theres the matter of tastenot everyone agrees completely about how something tastes to them but there are no flaws in this recipe its going into my bestloved file of recipes and ill be making it many times in the future
5,i made this for a family gathering never having made this recipe before i tripled the amounts and baked it in a sheet cake pan it was fantastic yes i was a little alarmed adding in simple sugar liquid and seeing how full the pan was getting but i had already read the recipes of people who didnt add all of the liquid it came out of the oven bubbly and smelling amazing i had many people ask me for the recipe im going nto make it for a potluck that my office is hosting before thanksgiving i know they will love it as much as my family did
5,this recipe is a great way to jazz up a traditional peach cobbler i used preserved peaches so i cut back the sugars to cup each the warmth from the spices and the comfort from the topping and syrup makes the perfect cold weather treat
5,the topping calls for halfandhalf cream how much it does not give a measurement in the recipe
5,i made this cobbler this afternoon i cannot get over how good it is this recipe is a keeper
5,this was delicious made it as dessert for our annual summer picnic everyone loved it and requested the recipe thanks toh
5,this turned out for me more like a coffeecake than a cobbler it set solid after bakingbut i will make this again i combined cups flour cup sugar teaspoons baking powder teaspoon salt added cup milk amp folded in cups sliced not peeled fresh peaches put this in a x glass dish then i made the topping in a saucepan using cups of water cup white sugar cup brown sugar tablespoons butter teaspoon nutmeg amp teaspoon cinnamon brought this to a boil stirring until sugars dissolved poured over the top baked at for minutes
5,excellent peach cobbler and the recipe was so easy will try it with blueberries or blackberries next time
5,when i closed the oven door on this concoction i was pretty sure i had wasted some nice ingredients fortyfive minutes later i opened the door to one of the best peach cobblers i have ever had the top was crisp there was plenty of sauce the peaches cooked perfectly highly recommend this recipe
5,loved this cobbler with lots of sauce
5,am making again tomorrow i didnt have enough room in the baking dish for all the sauce which i think worked out better was a thick breadpudding like texture instead of too saucy like some are saying when you put this in the oven it doesnt seem like it will come out well but it was perfect and very tasty will keep this forever
5,made this for thanksgiving used frozen peaches it came out saucy but very flavorful and my year old mom says this recipe is a keeper
5,this is my go to recipe for peach cobbler absolutely delicious
5,peaches are in season and i just made this recipe it is a very easy recipe to follow and to make end resultawesome i certainly will be making again and highly recommend this recipe
5,i was so worried when i saw how liquidy mixture was but followed directions as specified though i substituted milk for vanilla almond milk i read through prior reviews and did put a pan under bc it does boil over i cooked it for mins and all the liquid became a very thick saucesyrup its so good tastes like a bakery made this item not too sweet peaches soaked up all the good flavor sauce thickenedreduced to jelly like consistency next time i think i will cook mins or lower heat bc breaking cooked slightly harder then i prefer also i made to small carafes from same batch so id have testers they came out perfect cooked along side of larger pan
5,i doubled recipe but only used half the sauce it came out perfect plus it was delish with a scoop of blue bunny ice creme
5,a very rich dessert my grandmother has had a recipe for something similar with graham crackers the butter sauce and sliced almonds baked like this one that my family has always loved this one is has the added coconut marshmallows and cinnamon i will make it again
5,i have made carmel heavenlies many times the first time was when i received taste of home magazine i took them to a bake sale and included the recipe was a great hit
5,i have made these many times since they appeared in the taste of home magazine they are quick easy and never fail i will advise measuring the interior of your pan i have two pans sold as x one measures x on the interior and one measures x on the exterior which makes it smaller i like to use my larger x pan and increase the butter and sugar to cup each
5,i used cups of chopped pecans and about cups of marshmallows they are delicious
5,i fixed these when they first appeared in toh they were a hit
5,discustingly goodand easy to make
5,these are fantastic will be a regular addition to my christmas cookie list
5,i searched the web for a peach cobbler recipe and was glad to find this one the recipe is easy to make and absolutely delicious my picky grandson had four servings and everyone raved about it thank you
5,i made this for the th of july my husband said it was the best cobbler he had ever had it is easy and good the nutmeg and cinnamon make it stand out
5,i made this for my family and we ate the entire cobbler sooo yummy and easy to make i will definitely be making this again
5,omg the best easiest and tastiest peach cobbler ive ever made if you have sweet peaches nothing more is needed outside of the listed ingredients thank you
5,i tripled the recipe and used two x glass pans i also let the liquid boil for a few minutes which i think contributed to thickening i like to freeze individual portions i was a bit concerned when pouring the liquid on top because it seemed like it was too much but it worked out well i like the way it bakes into a mixture of cake and sauce the flavor of nutmeg and cinnamon is wonderful ive tried many peach cobbler recipes and this will not be my favorite yummy
5,excellent goes really good with a little halfamphalf i had really sweet south carolina peaches so i cut the sugar and brown sugar and water in half also deleted the nutmeg and cinnamon we like a lot of crust so next batch plan to double the flour mixture easy to make and just a wonderful cobbler definitely a keeper
5,this is the recipe i will use for all cobblers from now on i had my doubts when i placed the wet gooey mess in the oven that cups of liquid would ever soak in this is the best cobbler ive ever had and i even replaced both the white and brown sugars with splenda
5,these were a big hit at a boy scout functioneven people who dont like coconut loved them i will be making these again
5,quick easy and great
5,i made this recipe three times all summer long and these are my observations first and foremost if you follow my recommendations you will not have any problems at all despite what others say here what i did is use reynolds brand release foil make sure dull side is facing up in the xx pan make sure you leave enough foil hanging over the short ends to lift the cookies out of the pan later i also sprayed it with nonstick cooking spray very lightly i made sure all of the graham crackers fit properly in the pan trim using a paring knife if need beits much easier than you think once the crackers are in the pan properly i did use more than two cups of mini marshmallowsprobably cups totalenough to cover all of the crackers sufficiently then what i did is i used cup of butter and cup of light brown not dark brown sugar make sure you use real butter and fresh brown sugar i cooked it precisely minute after the butter melted i think what a lot of cooks are doing is cooking the butter and brown sugar mixture too long this will cause the cookies to not turn out like they are supposed to i know from experience i used teaspoons of good cinnamon like penzeys celyon and good double strength vanilla extract i also put a pinch no more of salt in the caramel mixture when it is cooked i transferred the entire caramel mixture into a pyrex measuring cup and poured it very carefully over the marshmallows so nothing puddled then i topped with the coconut and almonds and baked for minutes and then checked it my oven tends to be a bit psychotic so it only takes about one minute more in mine to brown when you take the cookies out of the oven you will see that the marshmallows look like they are not cooked all the way dont worry they will finish melting when you take them out of the oven remove pan from oven and place on a towel on table or counter for five minutes then lift cookies out by short ends with the foil overhang and place back on table or counter for five minutes or so depends on temperature in your house at the time then lightly spray a large pizza cutter with nonstick spray and use the pizza cutter to slice through the cookiesdont remove from pan right awayjust slice then let cool completely and put in a very loosely covered container they wont last long enough to go stale not to worry people are having problems with these cookies because i think they are cooking the caramel way too long even a minute too long is tooo long i hope this helps you guys so that you will try iteven try it again if you didnt like the way they turned out the first time happy baking
5,so good i used light brown sugar like someone else recommended and had to cut big marshmallows into small grocery store had no more minis kept everything else the same and they were awesome
5,was quite surprised these are actually pretty good they are crunchy with great flavor and texture and you dont even notice the bottom layer is graham cracker
5,these were delicious and easy to make
5,this recipe is amazing however i change it up a little by replacing the nuts with pretzel pieces it is the perfect sweet and salty treat
5,i actually had prepared these treats before and i prepared them again since i had miniature marshmallows which i needed to use up i did line the xx baking pan with heavyduty foil i didnt need to coat with cooking spray as i used the caramel mixturei just used cup chopped pecanswalnuts combined rather than almonds this time aroundi also baked the treats minutes and the marshmallows puffed nut nice and brownwhat i had done this time was melt the butter then add the brown sugar and cinnamon and mixed together i then added the vanilla extract these are very festive cookie treats for any holiday actually thank you for sharing this recipe with taste of home delowenstein
5,these were so easy and quick to make my husband likes them better than my toffee im taking them to my church for a bake sale i flipped them over on wax paper and cut them in rectangles the size of the grahams ill be making another batch for us soon
5,made this for the first time recently to take to a function it was a hit i recieved requests for the recipe i used an extra cup of marshmallows but other than that i did not alter the ingredients however if you truly use a pan with an interior measurement of x you will need a couple of extra graham crackers trim with a knife to fill the small gap at the bottom of pan fill the pan so the graham crackers dont shift around during baking as another reviewer suggested make sure there is an overhang of foil on the short ends for removal from pan spray the foil with nonstick spray and do not overcook the buttersugarcinnamon mixture only a minute after the butter is melted and sugar is incorporated into the butter watch the baking time carefully after the minute mark at minutes mine had browned only at the edges and not in the middle try to get to an overall golden brown without letting the outside edges get too overdone i let it cool for about min and then removed it from the pan by holding the ends of the foil i let it cool completely and then cut as directed with a sharp knife the pizza cutter idea didnt work well for me i will absolutely make this again
5,i just pulled this out of my recipe clips file last night to make for this holiday season i dont recall changing a thing when i made them for the first time last year and they came out great i plan to double this year since my fam went crazy over thesefool proof simple and yummy my kind of recipe also follow the previous reviewers advice about lining the pan with foil that made it a lot easier to get it out cleanly
5,these were so good made a pan before lunch and my husband amp i couldnt stop with just one serving a keeper for sure
5,loved these
5,these are easy and very yummyi always spray the foil with pamthey are always a hit
5,i used splenda brown sugarc instead these were so good i put most of them in the freezer to slow us downguess whatthey are really good frozen
5,
5,wow these are amazing the marshmellows melt into the carmel mix which leaves the graham crackers soft and slightly chewy its delicious i sprayed the foil with nonstick and didnt have any problems with sticking
5,this are absolutely divine i dont make these often because ill just eat them all
5,made a few changes to this sweetsimpletasty treat litely buttered foil then placed graham crackers to foil added cup of milk chocolate amp peanut butter morsels topped the marshmellows w morsels coconut pecans and crumbled sheet of graham crackers sprinkled over topbaked minutes wonderful amp easy dessert for the holiday color coconut w red or green food coloringbbrinson thomasville ga
5,i have been making this recipe since seeing it in toh years ago i spray the foil with nonstick spray and bake for about minutes just until the marshmallows are lightly browned when they come out of the oven i let them cool for about minutes and then score them i let them cool about minutes more and then remove them from the foil onto a cooling rack the first time i made them i let them cool completely and the foil stuck making them inedible ive also noticed that the longer i cook the sugarbutter mixture in the saucepan the crispier the cookies turn out these are a hit wherever i take them and i have many requests for the recipe
5,omg this is so delish everyone ask for the recipe and it couldnt be easier to make
5,these are to die for once you starting eatting them you cant stop thank you to rayemi for tell me to sray the foil and to score them after min and the remove after min i have another recipe like this that stick to the foil and that was the trick they scored so easy and came out without any problem watch out you might eat the whole pan yourself
5,i liked this recipe very much but i added chocolate morsels and the kids loved themas a matter of fact so did the adults
5,added chocolate chips on top really delicious
5,ive made this recipe several times now and it is a hit at our church dinners be sure to line the pan with foil and use a cookie sheet that has a lip all around the edges or youll have a mess well worth the trouble i always get requests for the recipe
5,these are awesome and so fast to make they disappear instantly wherever i take them i have been making these for a year already and always requested to bring them for events
5,this recipe was so good and very easy love it will make it again very soon
5,thought this would be a quick addition for christmas plates and was so surprised how very good they were a hit with me easy and the family so good
5,this recipe is a keeper it has a very nice flavor will make it again
5,awesome enjoyed every bite will definitely make again next time i would make a little spicier
5,this is a new favorite in my house its so quick and easy but tastes like it took all day i modified the recipe a bit i bake then shred the chicken i also leave out the onions i hate the texture but like the taste so i use onion powder i also hate the texture of green chiles so i puree them in the food processor
5,this is my favorite white chili recipe ive made it several times we found it to be a little hot for our taste so i now leave out the cayenne pepper sometimes i substitute a oz can of chicken instead of the fresh chicken breast and cook it in a crockpot on low for or hours then stir in the sour cream and cream just before serving
5,awesome white chili my husband was skeptical since chili is one of his favorite foods he loved it it is now a favorite in our house
5,this was super easy and delicious will definitely be making again
5,this recipe tastes so good i use garlic cloves instead of the powder and skip cayenne i already take cayenne caps each day loved it
5,this recipe is amazing i used ground chicken and ground italian sausage about half and half and followed the recipe exactly for everything else cooking the sausage and chicken together adds lots of flavor its turnout delicious twice now i highly recommend
5,a huge favorite in our house just make sure you use good northern beans i know that ive gotten some canned northern beans that are mushy to begin with that doesnt make for a good chili
5,fabulous recipe the best white chili i have had
5,so easy to make and so delicious we loved this recipe and will be making it again
5,i have never tried a white chili before but this was delicious and easy to prepare this will be part of my regular dinner rotation
5,i love this recipe i won most original in a chili cookoff with this
5,delicious
5,these were wonderful i took them to a church function and everyone wanted the recipe will definitely make these again
5,this is most definitely a new family favorite very quick and easy to make as soon as these came out of the oven i sprinkled some minichocolate chips on top mmmmmmmm im making them again this weekend
5,needs a little more caramel filling but the taste is great and very good
5,my family and friends thought these were amazing they taste more difficult than they were will definitly make again
5,these were outstanding so simple but soooo good i gave the recipe to almost everyone i know
5,i had to make bars for two community events these were such a hit at the first event that i made the same recipe for the second event also
5,quick easy to make taste great and was loved by all who i shared withmany requested my recipe i was almost embarassed to tell them how easy it was to make lee warmbrodt
5,great tasting super easy to prepare i made half the recipe because i didnt have enough graham crackers on hand and my husband and i ate most of them in one sitting ill certainly make them again and again the lady who thought they were a little dry must have baked them too long they are super chewylindalou
5,i made these and took them to the pharmacy where i work and everyone had one and wanted the recipes i printed copies and an additional the following daythey were wonderfullilyorlola from fl
5,fantastic the first batch disappeared so quickly i made another i didnt have any more coconut so i substituted chocolate chips and they were even better this recipe is definitely a keeper
5,these were very easy to make and very tasty i increased marshmallows to cups as barely covered the crackers i brought them to work and got excellent review quick to assemble
5,these are delicious and very easy to makebarb
5,oh my gosh my family and i loooooved this recipe i made it on a whim amp they had the entire recipe gone by the next night this is a good one thank you jlc
5,these were really really good but wont make them againthey were too messy and not real easy to deal with while trying to put them togethersure was worth a try though
5,ive been making these for several years now everyone loves them and they are so quick and easy to make they certainly live up to their name
5,this recipe was so good the sauce that you pour over the sandwiches is amazing i had to tweak it a little bit for picky people in my house didnt use horshradish and substituted spicy brown mustard and used dijon this was delicious i was in a crunch for time to make these so i put them in at for minutes they were perfect definitely would make these for a family gettogether
5,this is an amazing recipe you cannot imagine the flavor this combination of ingredients produces i have served it at a couple get togethers and it is the first thing gone
5,our family thinks this recipe is great
5,soooo delicious i didnt think my husband would like it but he ate buns super quick to put together i didnt let it sit at all just popped it right in the oven will definitely be making again
5,these were absolutely the best ever the horseradish sauce makes the sandwich i use creamy horseradish i have also made these with mayo and dijon mustard mixed together when i did not have any on hand there are plenty of combinations you could use to make them to your likings i prefer the original recipe though everyone raves about them when i do make them i would not change a thing in face i am making them next week for my daughter and her family
5,these were delightful ive made them several times every time ive substituted the poppy seeds for everything but the bagel seasoning and a few times ive mixed the creamed horseradish with a bit of mayo its delicious and the family loves it every time
5,if you have a serious sweet tooth i didnt enjoy the horseradish flavor just a personal preference but next time ill use mayo instead i doubled the sauce amp used a pkg of sweet rolls i had to put of them in a pan all by themselves which turned out to be a happy accident because it left more space around them for the sauce to caramelize so when you cut to separate them more of the thin crispychewy sauce stuck around the edges so you got more of the savorysweet chewy toffee for each sandwich next time i make them ill bake fewer in each pan so this will happen to all of them
5,these are a hit every time i make them a family favorite i dont use the horseradish since my family doesnt like it
5,these are easy to make and would be great for anything from a weeknight dinner to a super bowl party they are yummy with the horseradish but you can also substitute that with mayonnaise if horseradish isnt your favorite
5,i made these yesterday for dinner today served with homemade pasta fagioli i used white sharp cheddar cheese rather than swiss and used regular slider buns wow so good full of flavor my family loved them too
5,i have made these many times from the original magazine recipe every person i have shared them with has loved them my family the most thanks for the recipe
5,i first found this recipe in your magazine years ago and have been making them ever since everyone loves them i have added extra cracker pieces to the end as well and this year i believe the crackers themselves are being made smaller i used whole crackers i find it easier to cut them by taking the foilcookies from the pan put on a cutting board and using a pizza cutter thank you so much for sharing this recipe
5,i have made these often for potlucks at work and often get asked for the recipe i usually put a tiny bit more ham on each bun and tend to go lighter on the horseradish so it doesnt overpower everything
5,my cousin jessie has made these for our family on so many occasions and they are always a hit and never any left overs delicious easy and sure to impress your guests love love love them
5,i left the horseradish sauce off but did the rest exactly as written i took it to a church function and it was a hit everyone wanted my recipe
5,delicious dish made it for bridge club another way to make these with with a poppyseed dressing always a hit
5,delicious but note the video shows rolls in a square pan not a x inch pan the printed recipe says it makes rolls but it calls for an oz package of rolls an ounce package of rolls has rolls so it looks like the video is showing a oz package of rolls with rolls in a square pan but the printed recipe calls for rolls but says it makes so wondering if this can be fixed i did make rolls and i did times the other ingredients regardless this is good
5,the recipe does not call for rolls but oz the roll package is oz i use t each of brown sugar honey dijon mustard and poppyseeds t worchestershire no onion or horseradish sauce covered with foil min uncover bake min more can make right away
5,i used regular dinner rolls as i do not like really sweet bread and i only used but left the rest of the recipe as is it came out really well and we enjoyed it
5,this are always a hit i just skip the horseradish
5,i made these for the st time a couple weeks ago i didnt have any poppyseeds so left those out and i couldnt find any horseradish spread at my local grocery store so i used just the tiniest pinch of regular prepared horseradish on the bottom of each bun i also could only let them sit in the fridge for about an hour before we needed to eat lunch that day my teenage daughter who is the pickiest eater on planet earth loved them tomorrow night i am making a double batch of the sauce and pouring it over baked chicken breasts for a quick and easy dinner im also planning on making the sauce and pouring it over plain hawaiian rolls and baking them at easter for a quick and easy and different side for easter dinner the sauce is the boss lol soooooo tasty
5,my family loves these i always make a double batch for parties and potlucks one batch just as the recipe says the other batch i skip the horseradish and put a tiny smear of apricot peach or marmalade jam on the bottom bun leave out the onion in the butter sauce topper and use sesame seeds to differentiate between the two versions both are huge hits be sure to cut the ham and cheese to roll size before you put them together as it mskes them so much easier to cut for serving after theyre baked some vidros on the internet call for jyst laying large whole slices of ham overlapping on the bottom buns but then theres a huge mess when you try to cut them apart after baking avoid it by having the ham and cheese fit on the individual buns to start with
5,my girls rated this recipe the best i have made many versions of these over the past year and my daughter said these were the best shes had yet i followed gails suggestions review from april and broke the buns apart and topped each one with ham and cheese it was a little more time consuming but well worth it this ones going in the recipe box
5,yum i made these on a whim for my husband and myself i like that you cant mess this up and soooo tasty my husband preferred his hot and would nuke his for about seconds on high good hot or cold i used a large serrated knife to cut through and had no problems
5,family enjoys these tasty sandwiches only change for us it to use less horseradish it was a little too strong for our taste we use this when the family come often
5,crazy good double the recipe so you have lots though
5,not a fan of horseradish sauce or swiss cheese pepper jack cheese gave it the right kick for us
5,i did not change a thing these were super yummy a nice way to turn a simple sandwich into a meal i really liked how the bottoms of the sandwiches got nice amp crispy while the tops were soft amp pillowy the sauce was hard to pour so that each sandwich got a similar amount of stuff but in the end after baking it all evened out in the pan i put them in the fridge for a good part of the day amp not overnight amp they were fine make the sauce first assemble the sandwiches amp pour your sauce i used sandwich pal horseradish sauce amp it was perfect you could eat the onion sauce with a spoon i will make these again amp i might try the reuben idea too
5,wow these savory sandwich rolls are true winners i made it according to the recipe with no changes i served it with a salad and deviled eggs to a group of women for lunch raves abounded i love the fact that it is made the night before refrigerated and ready to pop in the oven right before serving all guests requested the recipe thank you iris for making me look like a culinary star
5,wonderful recipe the technique is the secret leave out items you dont have on hand or you know you dont like or sub with something similar the recipe still produces a great dish
5,we started serving this at funeral dinners at church now i make them for potluck dinners at church and theres never anything left
5,i made these sliders for lunch today and they were a big hit the dressingtopping brings out the flavor of the ham and cheese i will be making these again
5,served at a gathering and they disappeared didnt change a thing this recipe is definitely a keeper
5,very easy to make didnt change a thing my family lived it could see it being a great party food
5,soft creamy texture tasty this recipe is very satisfying
5,made for a family reunion and everyone raved gone in no time and everyone wanted the recipe will make again and again
5,made these for the family and they were gone in no time i added a little mayo to the horseradish sauce and omitted the poppy seeds because i was out of them the glaze was yummy and really made the sliders refrigerated them in the morning and baked them later that day this is great party fare will definitely make again
5,i made these for a recent finger foods potluck and they were delicious they are very easy to make i used creamy horseradish and that and the slightly sweet topping really made them something special
5,these are so delicious i dont care for horseradish so i skip that part but otherwise i keep it the same i made it for our christmas eve buffet and it was a real hit
5,we had these at church at a luncheon and they were a huge hit
5,these sandwiches are the best only problem is you need to plan ahead since the sandwiches need to refrigerate for several hours before baking however just a small inconvenience
5,i made these for another family and didnt get the opportunity to taste them myself my rating is based on their report of the sandwiches being very good
5,i made this and it was good i decided that the next time i would put a slice of bread and butter pickle inside on top of the cheese before putting the roll top on i like that i can make aheadr and the leftovers if any are good cold
5,these have been our go to weekend lunches for years we use the package of the brown n serve rolls that come in their own aluminum pan it saves cleaning another pan make sure you use a sharp bread knife when cutting into individual sammies these are best cut when they are cold coming out of the fridge we only add the brown sugar about every th time we make them it is a nice change of pace so is changing up the mustards wholegrain dijon and hotsweet for example when we use hotsweet we skip the brown sugar
5,these are delicious and are often requested at my house
5,been making these for years we have always known them as oven sammies family loves them and nice to have on hand when someone heads out the door so they can grab or hubby likes when i make these and he is doing yard work or other chores comes in for a break and has a couple
5,my family loves these i make up a batch and then freeze them in packages of two that way we always have them on hand for a quick sandwich super good
5,every time i try a new recipe i make it exactly as shown the next time i tweak with this recipe there is nothing to tweak it is delicious as is i made it as a snack at christmas and everyone loved it i ate as a snack love finding recipes i can keep forever
5,this is an easy and delicious recipe i did not have hawaiian buns so i used regular slider buns i dont like spicy so i used honey mustard instead of the horseradish sauce
5,i made these for the food bank volunteers and they loved them
5,this is a big hit at work and at my football tailgates i substitute real ham or ham loaves sliced thick in place of the deli ham and i use horseradish from the jar with regular mustard to spread on the bottom half of the bunsthis has to be prepared the day before you serve it but its definitely worth the effort
5,love it just the way it is my family is very happy when i tell them these are on the menu
5,the first time i made it my husband fell in love with it we had it for lunch and then again for dinner he said i could make it any time which is great as he is fussy the only things i did different is i forgot to get the swiss cheese so used mozzarella and i didnt have any poppy seeds it is a keeper
5,my family cant get enough of these every time i have made them so far ive left out the horseradish these are yummy
5,i made these twice over the past year and just love them so easy to prep ahead i dont seem to use a full cup of horseradish sauce but they still have a kick
5,i have made this a few times each with excellent results husband really enjoys this recipe the horseradish sauce gives it an extra zip fantastic dish for get togethers
5,delicious i love that you can make these ahead and then just pop them in the oven when youre ready i personally think between the caramelized onions and the king bread that adding the brown sugar makes it all too sweet and i will try it without the added sugar next time perhaps with some sauteed onions and peppers hmmm
5,these buns are absolutely the best so easy to put together and a carefree oven dish this would make a great potluck addition or appetizer or even lunch meal ill be pulling these out of the oven often
5,i have made these several times and each time they turned out great everyone just loves them these will become my go to recipe for any potluck
5,these are todiefor i make them all the time everyone loves them what a great breakfast dish
5,awesome dish these were a hit amazing flavor punch my boyfriend and i almost ate the whole pan in one sitting will be added to the rotation
5,i had leftover ham from sunday dinner so i decided to try these everyone really enjoyed these sandwiches make sure to use horseradish sauce or the horseradish may be over powering the grocery store near my home sells hawaiian mini sub rolls about the size of two regular rolls so i used these i didnt have poppyseed so i used deli mustard which had seeds i also used one and half tablespoons of mustard and brown sugar i stuck the sandwiches in the freezer for an hour before baking because i didnt realize they needed to be refrigerated for several hours until i started making dinner turned out wonderful
5,i made these for company amp everyone loved them only problem was the grocery store sold horseradish but not horseradish sauce i found a recipe online to make up my own horseradish sauce since using just horseradish would be too strong
5,perfect little sliders for any event not a fan of the hawaiian sweet rolls so i used rhodes frozen small dinner rolls for us they were perfect i also cut back on the brown sugar i also had no horseradish sauce so used mayonnaise on both the top and bottom of the rolls i also did not leave them over night in the fridge made up early in the morning worked out just fine this is a wonderful recipe one that i will frequently makejanietaste of home volunteer field editor
5,since we have toddlers who are picky eaters i omitted horseradish sauce but used butter instead the whole family and parents in laws loved it we have also made this when we have extended family over the children and teenagers and adults all love this dish
5,i have never been one to like horseradish or mustard that said i blended sour cream and added horseradish to taste the zip of the horseradish is part of what makes these so good the dressing made to pour over the sandwiches even with the dijon rounds these out perfectly i was so glad i tried this and the family devours them the convenience of making them several hours in advance going to run errands or work in the yardhouse then poppin them in the oven when we get hungry is great too a keeper of a recipe
5,best for a party
5,everyone loves this recipe and i never have any leftover ive doubled the recipe for potlucks and picnics i did use dijon mustard instead
5,these are so good and a great additon to any get together my family doesnt care for horseradish sauce so i usually make them without that ingredient but whenever i make these there are never any leftovers
5,i made this for our christmas gettogether and there were none left i have to admit that i was wondering how the sauce would taste but i am a firm believer in trying a recipe as its written before adding my own touches i wouldnt change a thing its absolutely delicious thanks for sharing the recipe iris
5,i made these for breakfast the day after thanksgiving when we planned to travel early in the morning just pop them in the oven for a hot breakfast on the go my family gave them rave reviews even with the horseradish sauce ive made them twice since then and used sesame seeds once instead of poppy seeds they are lovely and versitile as many substitutions can be made with good results
5,this were amazing used for a christmas brunch and should have made twice as much this will be a goto recipe
5,i made these for my coworkers for our christmas spread so easy to assemble the night before amp then bake at work in our mini kitchen everyone raved about how good they were this recipe will be a keeper
5,loved this recipe we will be enjoying this one again the horseradish added a nice little tang to the sweetness
5,yes i tried this recipe and served for christmas morning it was excellent and even made great leftovers heated up in a low oven in aluminum foil
5,suuuuuuuuuper yummy
5,these were amazing this is going to be regular for sure i loved how quick and easy this was to put together i paired it with a whole wheat pasta salad for a complete dinner meal i did not use the poppy seeds or mustard because i didnt have them on hand but they still turned out great
5,i made these with turkey amp american cheese and fed some hungry athletes while we were on the road they were a big hit now im making them again for my family
5,i havent made this exact recipe but im still giving it a thumbs upi got this recipe from a friend and it wasnt exactly the same no caramelized onions or horseradish or wshire sauce maybe she didnt like those things so left them out i dont think you can mess up this recipe i used regular hburger buns mustard powder no poppy seeds didnt have any i made them in a x pan the men thought they were alittle sweet but still devoured them my gkids just loved them and keep asking me to make them again this recipe is really pretty forgiving and versatile for me its a keeper now i want to try this versionoh also they freezer great
5,absolutely delicious and you dobt have to chill in the fridge you can assemble and pop in the oven
5,amazingly easy recipe that tastes like you spent a lot of time on it i was not sure of the combination of flavors but they turned out to be surprisingly delicious easily adaptable to a wide range of fillings a definite hit at the dinner table id make them for breakfast as well a real winner
5,awesome recipe i took these to a golf potluck and everyone raved about them several requests for the recipe
5,took this to two different gettogethers within one week and had a total of nine requests for the recipe moist and flavorful its so easy to prepare and just love that it can be fixed one night and bakedserved the next
5,followed the recipe exact except i used the pressure cooker on my instapot because i didnt have the time to wait hours came out fantastic was a hit with everyone a keeper
5,made the recipe as defined it was easy and everyone loved it the thighs vs breast is also a money saver
5,i have made this twice i followed the recipe aswritten using boneless chicken thighs my teen and tween sons loved it and wanted seconds then i sent the small amount of leftovers in the school lunch the next day by request this is on the favorites list
5,this is a delicious sandwich being pressed for time i did not let the sandwiches sit with the onions on top i used the large sandwich size hawaiian buns i made the caramelized onions but omitted the poppy seeds and put them on the sandwich on top of the cheese i wrapped the sandwiches in foil and baked them for minutes my husband is not a big ham eater and he said these were great he loved the flavors together this will be a recipe ill make again and again
5,i have been making a similar recipe for years i like the idea of the hawaiian rolls along with the horseradish sauce it puts a nice kick on the recipe i will make this recipe again
5,really good and fun to make for a little neater eating i added the onion mixture to the inside of the sandwiches and wrapped them in foil to bake i have some extras so i froze them before baking and can only assume theyll be just as good when thawed thanks for the recipe
5,these were awesome i took them to a pot luck and had to sweep in and grab the last one quickly so that i could try it all the different flavors come together really well i didnt use quite as much horseradish sauce as suggested and it still packed plenty of punch otherwise i followed the recipe exactly the sandwiches were surprisingly not messy this recipe is definitely a keeper
5,these are amazing my whole family loved them even my kiddos will definitely make these again
5,these are awesome everyone i have served them to loves them i used hot sweet mustard not the spicy brown mustard i also waited on the poppy seeds and sprinkled them on top
5,these are so good i have people over after evening church services a lot during the year and these have always been a huge hit my recipe however doesnt call for horseradish which is a good thing since i dont really care for it instead of swiss cheese i sometimes use gouda which melts so well
5,these are amazing i made them for our christmas party this year and our guests raved over them they will definitely become a standard on our party menu i doubled the recipe and mistakenly didnt double the sauce but it made so much it was a happy accident i wouldnt have wanted double the amount of sauce thank you for a fabulous recipe
5,made them this morning husband and i loved them very feeling and good tasting will make again
5,i made these christmas day and they were a big hit i reduced the horsehadish to cup there was no way i could fit sandwiches into a x pan so i made and put into a x pan and it worked out great i only added a little additional ingredients for the marinade which turned out perfect
5,great recipe for using up leftover ham we were in a hurry so i didnt let them sit plus i used regular large hamburger rolls and they still got unsolicited compliments from my family next time i might try planning ahead and let them sit overnight
5,so so yummy used leftover turkey and colbyjack cheese didnt have any seeds but it was still a delicious meal definitely a keeper
5,had to try this after seeing them in the magazine and floating around the net my family was very hesitant to try it because of the mustard in the glaze ive made it times now everywhere i go they are gone very quickly i have been making them by using a ct pack of rolls i slice the top off put the bottom half in the x layer on the toppings and put the top back on we dont use the horseradish or butter or anything inside of the sandwiches i use a large knife to cut through everything after they are done cooking we use tsp onion powder because we dont like onions ive let it sit over night and ive made them an hour after making them they are best when left to sit over night but still good if made sooner than that as well i havent had so many people ask for my recipe in a long time they are so unique and so good yum
5,really really good
5,ive had white chili before but thought a creamystyle would be a nice twist this was so delicious my husband kept raving about it
5,this is absolutely delicious i would give it a star rating if i could we made it exactly the way the recipe states we figured if we liked it and we were going to make it again we would make a change then however it is perfect exactly the way it is we love it i made a batch yesterday already gone so im making another batch today anyone who said they didnt like it which is maybe one or two must have used different brands or something than what we did because this is seriously goodi cant wait to have more today
5,i absolutely love this recipe and have made it many times since it made its first appearance in taste of home magazine back in the only negative is that it is a bit rich so it should probably be a onceinawhile thing
5,my husband and i loved this chili excellent recipe lots of flavor
5,this is a crowd winner every time
5,amazing
5,my husbands favorite soup ever
5,this recipe is also delicious when made in the crock pot
5,wow i thought it would be good but this is fabulous i served it with cheezit crackers instead of saltines and it was a hit this is a keeper
5,i added a chopped jalapeno texans love their heat fresh garlic and served with corn bread and had grated cheese and cilantro as toppers to add a little texmex to it very good
5,the flavor here is a nice mild heat tempered by the sour cream and heavy cream if you do not like heat omit the cayenne pepper i made a savory cornbread to go with this sans sugar added cheese garlic powder and onion powder in place of buttermilk i used powdered milk and a corn mealflour premixed and added a cup of cheese nice for a rainy autumn day enjoy
5,liked the flavor and the touch of heat was good
5,these dish was terrific it was a little spicy for me but my husband said it was just right because of some of the reviews the only thing i changed was cutting the whipping cream in half and only used ounces of sour cream definitely will be one recipe kept in my folder
5,this is a favorite recipe of ours i halved the recipe and it fit nicely in my slow cooker i set it for hours but or hours is sufficient definitely a star recipe
5,ive made this dish times changing the recipe slightly each time the first time i followed the recipe exactly the chicken was over cooked and the sauce seemed bland the most recent time i used brown sugar cooked the chicken less than suggested about hours doubled the cornstarchwater and it was the best attempt yet simple and tasty
5,super delicious very tender and tasty will definitely make again
5,this was super easy for a weeknight meal the family loved it i used bone in thighs and cooked it for hours will definitely make again thanks for sharing
5,we all loved this recipe adults and children alike ive made it twice the second time with rice vinegar and i thought that was better than cider vinegar
5,my favorite for sure easily translates left overs into bbq sandwiches the next night love this
5,great works well with chicken legs used brown sugar rather than white sauce did not thicken up as well as expected
5,wow i just made this and cant stress to you how delicious this was i adjusted the recipe because i didnt have lbs of chicken i had less than lbs so i reduced the amount it called for by half i also didnt use the low sodium soy sauce since i didnt have any on hand i just used the regular and it tasted fine so im not sure why everyone commented on how salty it was must try
5,everyone loved it know your crockpot though if it runs hot you will not need hours i cooked it for four but i will cook it for about three hours next time i didnt move the chicken to a platter i kept it in the crockpot and threw in a bag of frozen broccoli while i made the sauce after the sauce was made i poured it back over the chickenbroccoli while the rice was cooking easy and delicious
5,didnt have pounds chicken but made rest of recipe with full amounts used splenda brand brown sugar with half the sugar instead of white sugar i am diabetic after chemo and radiation so try to cut sugar when i can i got a new crock pot and set it for hours time had bone in thighs keep taking lid off and flipping thighs to keep ladling sauce on top several times during cooking when i went to remove chicken with two tine fork it fell apart and the bone fell back into pot oh my gracious the sauce is good enough to eat by itself lol fantastic recipe made baby broccoli florets with sharp cheddar cheese instead of rice it was a great meal so easy to make thanks for sharing with us
5,good recipe making homemade versions of store bought items is what i like this recipe does just that with the teriyaki sauce cooking chicken on the stovetop is my preferred method as it gets it browned and caramelized otherwise the recipe was followed as written
5,was delicious i followed exactly but added a few drops of sesame oil my husband and i really enjoyed
5,i have made these several times and as long as i dont over cook the chicken its delicious my husband is not as wild about the dish as i am but thats only because he prefers using chicken breasts rather thighs i serve the sauce over riced cauliflower rather than rice to save carbs and pair that with steamed broccoli for a healthy meal
5,a good recipe i used only c sugar still a good flavor i did sear the chicken first placed the slow cooker on high for an hour then finished on low for only hours the chicken was so tender
5,this is an excellent recipe i read about a few people ending up with dry chicken so i cooked pounds of chicken breast on low for hours the chicken came out perfect also when i was making the sauce at the end i added tablespoons of brown sugar and increased the corn starch to make the sauce thicker so good
5,made this tonight and my husband and i really liked it our two year old daughter even ate the chicken and she tends to be picky about meat on the suggestion of some i used brown sugar and liked the way it tasted im not wild about asian dishes but i would recommend this to anyone
5,this was very good i cooked on low for hours hours and it came out very moist also used brown sugar and served with rice and broccoli the sauce was perfect
5,delicious i didnt use my crockpot because it over cooks the chicken i browned the chicken in a little olive oil then i drained the grease and cooked the chicken in the sauce until done then i put the chicken on a plate and added the cornstarchwater mixture to the pan and heated until thick then added the chicken back to the pan chicken was tender and not over cooked
5,i had some left over fresh pineapple green pepper so added it to the chicken poured the sause and let it cook in the slow cooker tasted great but will use brown sugar next time as the white is a little to sweet
5,my very picky family is already asking when i will make this again i did tweak the recipe in part because of personal preference but also because i used what i had on hand i used about lbs of boneless skinless thighs following the advice of other reviewers i used brown sugar instead of white i also added honey and grated some ginger into the mixture i substituted rice vinegar for apple cider vinegar and cooked on low in the crockpot for just under hours also i found that i needed to double the cornstarch mixture at the end to get a good thickness served over quinoa and steamed broccoli and it was a big hit
5,super easy
5,i followed this recipe just as it says and my whole family loved it thanks so much for sharing
5,very good moist meal
5,delicious and easy need i say more
5,this was a very tasty dish i cooked on the stove top on a low flame for about hour or so till chicken was and turned out great the sauce is very rich and flavorful
5,this was so easy to put together delicious and great left over i would definitely do this again
5,made it in hour superb recipe i added water to bring down the salt level because braggs soy sauce alternative and i added a bit of palm oil as well thank you for sharing
5,got rave reviews
5,tasty easy to prepare i added some stir fried celery onion bell pepper and green beans
5,chicken was very good easy to prepare
5,so easy and delicious my kids adored this meal
5,amazing the last minutes of cooking time i transferred thighs to a degree oven delectable
5,oh my goodness this is the best teriyaki style recipe i have ever made its easy and versatile sometimes i add sliced water chestnuts during the last hour of cooking and garnish with thinly sliced green onion just delicious made this again about weeks after this st review and used country style spareribs instead of chicken thighs it was amazing love this recipe
5,very tasty and easy love it with steamed rice and broccoli
5,excellent i used brown sugar instead of white upped the garlic to two cloves and the ginger to one teaspoon and added cup chopped shallots i servd it over brown rice and my family loved it a definite keeper
5,very good i did make a couple of changes but not in the ingredients only in preparation i cut up the thighs and poured the sauce over the pieces and baked them there was
5,have a very picky family and this one is definitely a hit we all love the sauce absolutely agree with the lowsodium soy recommendation have made it several times with chicken thighs has anyone tried it with pork chops seems like it would work wellmaybe with noodles and broccoli
5,very good i didnt use ginger because i dont like the taste of ginger and i used tsp of garlic powder because i didnt have minced garlic the family really liked it
5,this was amazing simple cheapmy husband was away on business but he loves thighs so i cant wait to make this for him this tasted just like my favorite fast food chinese restaurant
5,this was fabulous
5,yummy because i am such a lazy cook i didnt even bother with the cornstarch amp cold water business i hate to have another pan to wash such a super recipe theresa
5,this is a great recipe and the slow cooker made the thighs extremely tender cook up some rice and snow peas and you have a great easy to prepare meal
5,this is one of the few things my family of all like to eat for dinner i only use about thighs i subbed pineapple juice for the cider and just use garlic powder picky kids when i transfer sauce to skillet i add frozen broccoli with the corn starch heat then add the chicken and serve over rice my kids devour the broccoli in this yummy sauce thank you for sharing recipe we have this at least times a month god bless
5,we loved the taste
5,my entire family loved this chicken i served it with rice amp steamed veggies
5,my husband and i cut this down to only making a of this recipe which worked out really nice for the two of us and fit in our quart slow cooker this recipe goes really well with fried whole grain brown rice
5,loved it made in small crock and it worked great not sure where the complaint with salt was because it was definitely not salty
5,im glad i found this recipe i was about to prepare a typical soy sauce based asian thigh recipe but was out of soy sauce in a quick search i found this and had all the called for ingredients the only addition my family made was some added chinese hot sauce to theirs to kick up the heat great dish
5,very good we especially liked the sauce
5,ive made this recipe for years since it was first published the first time i made it i followed the directions exactly and found it a little too spicy with the green chilies the next time and each subsequent time ive left out them out and to my family its the perfect white chili
5,ive been making this same recipe for years and it is always a hit i add a can of white sweet corn to it and serve with cornbread
5,i found this recipe a couple of years ago it is one of the most requested recipes by my family in the fall and winter
5,ive been making this for years it is the absolute best chili and easy to make its a hit whenever i serve it
5,i have been making this for years it is a huge hit i omitted the whipping cream and add canned milk thickened with a little corn strarch i also omit the cayenne pepper it was just to spicy with it
5,i too have been making this chili since i first received my taste of home magazines as a yearly gift from my mom years ago very easy and very tasty now the weather is here for this recipe to be used alot we are steering away from red meat so this is a winner
5,made this recipe exactly as stated except i doubled it glad i did because it was gone delicious and quick
5,wonderfully delicious on this cold winters day im an intermediate level cook i get excited about finding and trying new recipes and today im totally excited this is just an easy recipe with a lot of taste i followed the recipe exactly and wont change a thing when i make this again and again and again thank you for the recipe happy eating everyone
5,every one enjoyed this meal the heat was perfect for me i added cheddar cheese to the top and had some tortilla chips with that others in my household also added jalapenos and hot sauce as they like things extra hot i guess everyone loved it and it was so fast and easy to make
5,this was simple to make but had a flavor that will make your family think you have worked all day preparing it didnt change a thing next time i will try the advice to serve with cornbread
5,excellent flavor delicious and quick this one is a keeper
5,i love anything with green chilies in it and this was great i could have eaten the entire pot it was so good our weather became winter overnight below the other night and this was hearty tasty and super easy to make the perfect cold weather recipe i had to make a few adjustments because i live in the country and didnt want to navigate the icy roads just to get the few ingredients i was lacking i looked up substitutions for heavy cream and sour cream on the internet and i am certain it was close i used fresh garlic and added red pepper flakes because i love them and add them to whatever i can get away with i would add them to my coffee if it would work thank you laura for this great recipe i am debating whether to make another batch tomorrow i usually share what i cook with family that lives close by but i want to hoard this it is so good i dont review many recipes but this one was worth searching for my login info to leave my comment
5,excellent is all i can say with cornbread muffins yum yum
5,made this hearty chili tonight for dinner and my family really loved it it has a nice combination of flavors and is really delicious i will be adding creamy white chili to my recipe book
5,good stuff i made it for dinner this weekend my girlfriend and i loved it i substituted about oz of recently purchased dynamite roasted chilies for the oz of canned green chilies we both like our chili with a tad of whang to it the two of us finished off the leftovers the next day for lunch i will definitely be making this again
5,great recipe cant wait to make it again
5,great recipe would certainly make againvery tasty
5,tasty is how my husband described this dish and my picky eater daughter said very good i used chicken breasts in this recipe very good and easy the sauce was excellent
5,i made this tonight and it was excellent i used chicken breasts and boneless skinless thighs the only thing i had to do was increase the cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce but that is no big thing it was super good and im sure well make it again soon
5,i dont often use my slow cooker but i was eager to try this recipe im glad i did as it was delicious i used lowsodium soy sauce and did not find it too salty i am making it again today and im certain it will be a staple in our household
5,after eating a lot of dry chicken in college i was done with chicken every once in a while i would try a chicken dish and no i did not like chicken but years after college i gave this recipe a try and loved it sooooo good i forgot i was eating chicken
5,used chicken wings and only cooked hours my yr old gave it a hubby said it was a keeper had tons of sauce left over and used it in a stirfry the next day the other two like it as a dipping sauce for chicken nuggets
5,very easy to prepare and the sauce cooks up thick and rich will try this with chicken flavored rice
5,i found this recipe a couple of months ago and have made it times already its delicious i definitely recommend that you use low sodium soy sauce also i used both chicken thighs and breasts but found that the breasts turned out too dry served this with steamed broccoli mixed in right before serving
5,big hit in the house and super easy i have made it with bonein and boneless chicken theighs both amazing
5,this dish was so easy and my whole family loved it i served it over rice and cooked veggies and it was a big hit
5,delicious dish the whole family loved it the first time i made it i forgot to thicken the sauce and it was still wonderful will absolutely make again
5,i didnt actually make this exact recipe but i did make the sauce part of it i never seem to have a bottle of teriyaki sauce on hand and i was desperate for some last night for an asian beef and broccoli dish i was making so i was very happy to come across this recipe so quickly in the cookbook that i recently got in the mail my family devoured it the chicken looks delicious so ill be putting it on the menu very soon
5,i already reviewed this recipe but i have to rave about it again i make this dish often because my family goes nuts over it i always make broccoli separately to add to the dishes of those who will eat vegetables and i also pour the sauce into a saucepan and then triple it because they love lots of extra sauce this is a fabulous recipe
5,i made this for my teenager and his friends and it was a big hit with them and my husband and me i used boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of the thighs at the end i covered a broiler pan with nonstick foil laid the cooked chicken on it brushed tops of chicken with thickened teriyaki sauce broiled for minutes then flipped chicken and repeated for other side served with rice and passed the sauceyummy i made a little extra sauce because i cooked a little more than lbs of chicken using a qt slow cooker it didnt go to waste my son used it over the next few days with leftovers and with other things he made for himself its very good teriyaki sauce i served this dish with honey sauteed broccoli and carrots which was a delightful complement i will definitely make this dish again i love finding tasty easy recipes for the slow cooker
5,i really liked the flavor of this recipe and the convenience of a slow cooker recipe i made it with boneless skinless chicken breasts
5,i made this and it is amazing the sauce is the best served wfried rice i used tb minced garlic and ginger instead of powdered thanks for sharing
5,my family devoured this chicken the sauce is excellent and goes great over rice i could not find boneless skinless chicken thighs at the grocery store so i used bonein chicken thighs that i took the skin off of i tried boneless skinless chicken breasts once but have to say the bonein thighs gave it more flavor however both are good
5,i put a little of the teriyaki sauce in a skillet and glazed the chicken right before i served it we love this recipe
5,omgosh absolutely wonderful all of my men raved about how good supper was i dont normally double or triple recipes i havent made before but i doubled this one and im thankful i did will be making triple batches from now on just to make sure there is enough for all my hungry men and a bit leftover for mom for lunch may end up making a second crockpot full just for the teriyaki sauce to use for other things like pork chops may add a bit of sesame seeds toasted next time my crew loves them
5,wonderful i made a change i only had c of soy sauce and i used c of teriyaki along with it i only used t vinegar this was great i would use broccoli florets next time
5,i did this yesterday for my first dinner party with church friends and it was awesome used light brown sugar instead and served with minute brown amp wild rice amp wilted spinachnot a bite was left
5,this is amazing one of my familys favorites i highly recommend it
5,this is amazing a family favorite
5,great recipe i did use boneless skinless breasts and browned the chicken in a skillet before putting it in the slow cooker my sauce came out a little too runny and needed a little extra cornstarch
5,i didnt use the ginger because we didnt have any and it was still amazing i used chicken breasts and was worried it tasted too plain but once i made the sauce i was in love best sauce ever
5,super easy and tasty best fudge recipe ive found
5,super easy super creamy and so delicious makes terrific instant gifts it also freezes very well nice clean cuts into perfect bite sized squares i used crunchy peanut butter for that extra little peanut butter taste vfe
5,this is a favorite in our house and easy to make i add melted chocolate across the top for an added kick

5,this is a fantastic recipe
5,just made this just easy an easy best one definitely for a quick an soft fudge negative people cook it your own way then why ya looking if yours is so fantastic good recipe give it a try
5,this fudge is heaven it brings back elementary school lunch memories everyone looked forward to home cooked lunches with homemade fudge for dessert yummy thank you
5,i cant make fudge the old fashioned way because i cant stir or hold on to the spoon long enough to bring it up to temp needed to set correctly i now use the marshmallow creme to make all my fudges

5,pvery good easyp
5,made this recipe many times went to make it tonight and didnt have milk so i used half and half instead came out really creamy and really delicious recommend trying it
5,id never made fudge before and was scared this is the best fudge ive ever eaten made it many times last fallwinter and getting ready to make it again for the nd time in two weeks thank you so much
5,i have made this many times it is the best and easiest recipe ive found for peanut butter fudge i went to get the ingredients today to make more and both stores in my little town were sold out of marshmallow creme i am wondering if i can make this with whole marshmallows what adjustments i need to make if so id appreciate any help please thanks for the best fudge recipe ever
5,best fudge recipe very fluffy and creamy we only make at christmas and my husband helps with the stirring yields great results
5,topped with mini marshmallows salted peanuts amp chocolate chips amp under the broiler a couple minutes then swirled the topping very rich
5,ive never made fudge before and i must admit after reading some of these flop reviews i was a little scared but this fudge turned out perfect and my entire family loved it i will definitely make this again for the holidays
5,ive tried lots of recipes this was the first that came close to the one my mother always made i used crunchy peanut butter and added some vanilla and a pinch of salt i greased the foil with spray and added the butter to the milk and sugar mixture so glad this recipe doesnt need a candy thermometer prep your ingredients first so you can mix quickly
5,i have make this recipe for years and love it use a flavorful peanut butter for best results
5,i tried this from googling peanut butter fudge it was easy creamy and taste heavenly
5,easy fast amp delicious no changes
5,omg yum super easy didnt require a candy thermometer which i loved and everyone is absolutely raving about this fudge
5,this is perfect my son in law finishes the entire recipe in days every time i make it so easy too
5,when i first discovered this recipe in your magazine years ago i gave it a try because it sounded so easy and it was it was exactly like the peanut butter fudge they used to serve in the school kitchen when i was little soooooo good at debbie on nov the butter is used to grease the pan in step at susan on apr maybe you should give the recipe a try before giving it such a poor rating the marshmallow fluff gives the fudge a soft slightly fluffy texture and is not at all gross im not fond of thick dense hard fudge this definitely is not thick and dense or hard its nice and soft and fluffy
5,this is the easiest recipe ever turned out perfectly and i stirred and stirred continuously thats the key to keeping the mixture from burning used real butter to coat the pan to give it a rich buttery taste saved and treasured
5,soooo good clear easy recipe no changes came out great
5,my first attempt at this fudge produced very dry and crumbly fudge i changed when i started timing my boil time the second time and the fudge was perfectwhen you time for the minutes do not start timing at a full boil i did this the first time and my fudge was very dry and crumblystart timing for your minutes as soon as it starts to boil i removed from heat after the minutes of boil before i added the marshmallow fluff and peanut butteri only had a oz jar of fluff and measuring out oz was a pain i highly suggest buying the oz jar if possiblegood luck
5,easy to make and tastes great
5,evryone i have made it for loves it
5,this was quick and easy and good you have to start the timing when it begins to boil though
5,is delicious and easy to make be careful though if youre addicted to sweetsthis is so good you might eat the whole pan of fudge yourself
5,its the easiest fudge recipe ive ever found that produced such delicious results i get requests from friends and family for this amazing fudge i typically make it the night before and allow it to set overnight then i cut it with a greased pizza cutter im not sure about it yielding dozen unless you cut the pieces very very small i would say more like dozen would be more accurate
5,the flavor of this fudge is absolutely delicious i made the mistake of substituting marshmallows for the marshmallow creme so unfortunately the fudge did not set thats okay though as we will now use this delicious confection as peanut butter topping for ice cream
5,i made this yestter day did not go will i thank i boiled it to long so i made it today and it whent realy good
5,mine turned out great if it burns that means your heat is too high try medium heat
5,this is the best recipe i have tried my kids love it too stars i used marshmallow cream and regular marshmallows my fudge set just fine
5,this turned out perfectly i read previous reviews before trying this one the problem with a lot of recipes is lack of details have your marshmallow creme jar open and your peanut butter i used jif no stir natural creamy peanut butter already measured out prep your pan before you start i line a x glass pan lined with parchment you must first bring the milk i used evaporated milk and sugar to a full boil one that does not go away when stirred i usually start with mediumhigh to get the boil going then back off to medium once its boiling you must stir constantly begin your minute timing once the mixture comes to a full boil take the pan off the heat i immediately stirred in a tsp of vanilla now youve got to work quickly add your peanut butter and marshmallow creme stir with a wooden spoon until thoroughly combined pour into your prepared pan let it cool completely at room temperature to cut it just lift it our with the parchment paper and place it on your cutting surface cut into squares because its quite rich love this recipe plenty of peanut butter flavor for me
5,i just whipped up a batch and it turned out perfectits chilling now so i dont really know how its going to cut amp taste but the fudge looks smooth tastes wonderful super easyi cant wait to try a piece
5,the best peanut butter fudge ever we never use another recipe its like a fluff sandwich on sugar steroids
5,very good i didnt have any of the spices but had a pack of white chicken chili seasoning and used it i also left out the green chilies since i have young children because we have people in our family i added more cans of beans and more broth to stretch it further still very good gonna add this to my regular winter recipes
5,made this and everyone loved it i didnt have the green chilies so i used a few red pepper flakes will definitely make this again
5,this is now my chili recipe its a total knockout i use can of northern beans can of garbanzo beans and can of sweet white corn my friends and family beg for it
5,this chili was amazing my family loved it i definitely recommend trying it
5,this was delicious everyone in the family enjoyed it definitely a keeper
5,so good my husband and i really liked it better than my other white chili recipe
5,would make again used approx cup sour cream and a little under cup for the whipping cream to make it thicker simmering helps the liquid reduce made corn bread to go with it yum
5,have made this several times its a big hit in our house
5,weve made this twice in the last two weeks yummy
5,absolutely delicious reading all the reviews i have to say ditto excellent fantastic wonderful wouldnt change a thing i did chop my chicken that was parcooked instead of cubing it however and cooked in crock pot minutes on high then about hours on low my yearold is picky and didnt seem thrilled about white chili he now says its the best thing in the world and he could eat it every night it went great with tortilla chips too
5,for me a published recipe is a guideline rather than an absolute i adjusted this recipe slightly based on the ingredients i had on hand i added t poultry seasoning in place of oregano used minced garlic instead of garlic powder i only had one can of chopped green chilies so added a cup of chopped red yellow and orange bell pepper we like heat so i used t of cayenne and we added sliced jalapeo peppers and shredded cheese on top forgoing the sour cream i used c of whole milk instead of heavy whipping cream and t corn starch as a thickener there are so many ways to make white chili that as long as you keep it white and use the right amount of herbs and seasoning based on the preferences of those you are feeding youve got a hit every time our side was a handful of gluten free corn chips but sweet cornbread would be perfect too
5,sunshinebakerpa said i made it without the green chilies but found it was missing something i used a little less sour cream and heavy cream like the others had suggested to make it thickerso you made your own chili recipe omitted chilis and thought it was missing something then you rated this recipe i hope you arent a registered voter

5,great recipe i used cherry tomatoes as thats what the garden is overflowing with i can only hope cooks reach a point of reading a recipe and assessing if the types of seasonings or quantity of seasonings suits their tastes and then decide how or if you wish to make said recipe we enjoyed this with additional fresh ground black pepper thank you
5,this is a great recipe i made if for my husband and he loved it
5,after chopping and laying out the ingredients my first step was to whisk the mayonnaise vinegar salt and pepper my second step was to add the tomato celery and green onions to the dressing and blend it well to integrate the flavors into the dressing then i continued on with the rest of the recipe it was delicious
5,this dish was delicious and one i will make again and again i used cherry tomatoes as thats whats in our garden

5,i sometimes substitute cooked salad shrimp for the bacon but bacon or shrimp everyone loves this salad
5,well i made it and felt like it was just like something my mom or grandma would make maybe it is because i too am from indiana maybe because both sides of my family in a weird way are wrights maybe that is why i liked it too i miss my grandparents and my mom probably the taste buds in the midwest are far different than other regions if youre concerned about soybean oil then i know there are other mayos you buy or make your mayo from scratch i find it unfair that someone would call this a loser or anyones recipe a loser just simply state that if it was not for your taste buds instead of insulting someones recipe that might have hurt their feelings i frankly thought when i saw thati will not dare share any of my families recipes because of how insulting people can be in this day
5,i cant understand the downers on this recipe i took it to a large get together an even with doubling of the recipe there was none left and people were asking for more this recipe is a keeper i made sure i used real mayo great salad
5,the family and i thought this salad was delicious am already planning on making it again
5,ive been making this since it first appeared in a magazine over years ago we love this simple salad

5,this is a great recipe i did only put half the sour cream in and added no cream turned out sooo yummy
5,this chili is off the charts good everyone in my family raved about it i did use fresh minced garlic and added more chicken and beans for a bigger crowd this is definitely going in my favorite recipes box
5,i love this and so did my family

5,this chili was very flavorful and easy to makefreezes well
5,made just as recipe read except i only had milk all it needed was a pan of cornbread delicious
5,fantastic taste it is more like a soup than a chili i didnt read the directions carefully amp added the sour cream amp heavy cream at the same time as everything else still turned out perfect the only changes i made was i used leftover roasted chicken amp fresh green pepper instead of canned
5,delicious just the two of us and my husband almost ate the whole dish he said if he was at a party hed fill half his plate up with this salad very good
5,im always looking for new macaroni salad recipes my family loves pasta but not the classic mustardmayo based mac salad this recipe for a huge hit with my picky family the flavors blend together well once you give it time to sit together
5,great recipeentire family enjoyed we made as a meal and added some garlic powder and a couple handfuls of fresh spinach as well will be a fantastic potluck dish thanks for sharing
5,oh my oh my an absolute keeper i just tweeked it a little by adding garlic powder to the mayo mixture and toasted slivered almonds to mix in when adding the bacon crisps just a little added crunch thank you so much for the recipe enjoyed by all
5,i just want to add that i make this same dish but add shredded cheddar cheeseit is a dish everyone loves
5,loved it loved it loved it thats how many times ive made it so far and will continue also have many requests for the recipe bless your heart norene
5,i added an extra tomato and everyone loved it
5,i doubled this recipe and only used tsp of vinegar used more salt and pepper brought it to a large family gathering and everyone loved i lots of compliments
5,i made this for my husbands birthday barbecue last month we had a few people over and the bowl was empty at the end of the meal
5,what a big hit everyone loved it at our party will make it again
5,a great base recipe to start with made this for labor day party and made it again since then i added a little garlic powder and used champagne vinegar and a little bit of dill pickle juice to zip it up best of compliments a clean bowl
5,i made this tonight for sunday dinner i made it according to the recipe and added a bit of garlic powder it was delicious everyone loved it so itll be one of my favorite recipes for mac salad
5,ive made this salad at least a dozen times by now everyone loves it i usually use miraclewhip which is lower fat than real mayo and it tastes delicious i also mix in about t or so of the bacon grease to the salad for more bacon flavor bacon junkies here great recipe
5,it is very easy to make and refreshing any time
5,i cant believe i forgot to rate this one i have been making this for several years and always get rave reviews its definitely a family favorite ill sometime use real bacon bits in place of cooked bacon and it comes out just as wonderful
5,make this all the time a favorite
5,baconholic here so this is a good base recipe because you can take it and go from there i use tsp of fresh coarse ground black pepper instead tsp also i add leaves of romaine lettuce ribs removed chopped to about the size of a quarter and or depending on the size diced hass avocados and a good full cup of grated sharp cheddar cheese also i use the whole pkg of elbow macaroni the mayo i use is my own home made from an old wesson oil recipe for mayo that came out in the s we love this salad but it certainly does not make servings unless youre the food police we like having some left over to snack on later
5,i love the people here we dont worry about carbs fats etc we seem to be home cooks with a family to feed amp please common sense suggestions to make this more flavorful amp realistic serving amounts i really love you guys because we do home cooking not the modernday always healthy stuff that our families dont enjoy ive made this salad since it was in toh in amp its been a favorite with our family of eight now up to i too add oz of sharp cheddar cheese amp any garden produce we have on hand it changes a little every time i make it amp they always enjoy it
5,cant say thank you enough i was so tired of making my standard macaroni salad and gave this one a try it was a hit and thanks to those that suggested miracle whip will try that this weekend
5,great salad i too added some cheddar cheese to it and i absolutely adore the addition of bacon my husband is not a fan of macaroni salad but he love this one
5,i made this dish over the weekend for a pool party and it was a hit the only thing i did different was that i added a little more mayo than what the recipe called for and i added some italian dressing to give it extra flavor this will definitely remain in my recipe file for a delicious summertime salad great combination of flavors
5,made this for th of july bbq after cooking the macaroni i realized it didnt make very much so had to cook up more cups so if youre bringing this to a party make sure you double the recipei added cubed cheddar cheese and a few t spoons of ranch dressing powder we thought it was very good
5,very good if this is the main dish i would not say that it serves more like i like lots of veggies so i tripled the tomatoes and doubled the celery really liked itmaybe ill triple celery next time too for the bacon i used scissors and cut the raw bacon into small pieces and then fried it in a large dutch oven and stired occasionally
5,great salad sometimes i add sweet or dill pickle relish or both and some seasoning salt also adding a little milk will thin out the dressing a little
5,i made this recipe for a group of and had many compliments its very easy and if you like a tangy dressing youll like this
5,i made this for a party of and had many compliments it easy to make and if you like a tangy dressing youll like this
5,i made this for a party of and had many compliments if you like a tangy dressing youll love this recipe
5,my family loves this salad
5,this has become our favorite pasta salad everywhere i take it there are rave reviews it is excellent
5,this is a great recipe ive made it twice now the first time just as written the second time i didnt want to cook bacon lazy i guess so i used a package of real bacon still good
5,very very good
5,yummy my husband loves it i mad it twice in the last weeks
5,ive made this salad several times each time it is a crowd pleaser
5,my husband and i thought this was a very good salad we will be making this again
5,fantastic recipe i rate this as a full five star recipe it just was not letting me do the star rating part furthermore i have been making this for years and everyone loves it i actually searched it just to give it a rating i initially got it from the taste of home magazine everyone that tastes it asks for the recipe and i never have left overs my husband actually asks me to make batch for the house and the bbq so he can have some when he wants a snack later because he knows it will be gone before we get home i have even have people complain that i did not make enough because it is gone before they can even dish their plate at the bbqs it is a keeper i did not put celery in it or the pepper i also let the bacon and veggies sit in sauce for five ten minutes before i pour over the noodles and i think it makes for better flavor
5,love this salad everyone asks for the recipe and no left overs ever i actually get people complaining because i did not make enough after doubling the recipe the only thing i do differently is i do not add the celery and pepper
5,pi was looking for something different to make as opposed to the usual standbys that i do i found this and made it i made a double batch and was lucky enough to get a small bowl of it this will not sit around long at allppit is our new favorite mac saladp
5,i have been making this recipe for many years now i have been told that i cant come to summer parties wo this salad it is a family favorite amp whenever i introduce it to a new group of people they beg for the recipe this ones fantastic
5,pdelicious you must try this recipe great for a grill out nightp
5,pthis is very good as i went to write the review i realized i left out the vinegar when i made this still very good without it i plan to take this to a church dinner in a few weeks fast and simplep
5,yummy a great summer side dish or potluck dish this appeals to many rather than a few
5,i take this salad to pot lucks often especially in the summer it is definitely a crowd pleaser
5,i like this salad it is especially good with fresh garden tomatoes and really great butcher shop bacon
5,i love this recipe one of my favorite recipes for pasta salad its also very easy to make i get compliments and recipe requests whenever i make it i use light mayo not miracle whip and it does not affect the flavor or texture
5,i have made this recipe many times and it is always a hit very easy too
5,one of my favorites making it again for our homecoming at church i always substitute grape tomatoes
5,we love this salad its easy to make and alsoeasy on the wallet goes with everything
5,tjis recipe is different from any other macaroni salad out there it is really good and my family loves it
5,this is so good every time i make it for a potluck the bowl is empty right away love it
5,this was very good i used mustard instead of the vinegar and my husband and i both loved it i would make this again for any family get togethers
5,good either just made or from freezer
5,even though i didnt have whole flour on hand they came out amazing i see many more of these in my future but not to many they are a heavy pancake
5,these are amazing pancakes we love them in the fall with warm syrup yummmm
5,i started making these for my family a few months ago my teenage boys love them and dont want me to ever go back to my previous also very good pancake recipe these stick with you a little longer one son eats them with peanut butter on them one with syrup and the third with applesauce sometimes i use jam my husband likes them with whatever there is to put on them
5,these pancakes are wonderful the only change i make is i only use not packed brown sugar i also let the batter sit for about minutes and they come out perfect every time thanks for the recipe
5,we loved these pancakes light and fluffy
5,made this am are great next time will drop sugar to cup were not too sweet but i like to top pancakes with powdered sugar and lingonberries ie sweetness on top not in my pancakes we only have regular oats because we eat oatmeal and reg tastes better but worked finei soaked the oats for mins in the buttermilk while i mixed dry ingred and cooked sausage had to add another tbl or so of milk after combining all ingred one note they dont really bubble to indicate turn now by time they really bubble too done so check early on
5,my pancake aficionado kids loved this recipe and said no more regular pancakes i added a small scoop of applesauce after reading all the reviews that talked about such thick batter my batter wasnt thick at all but i also didnt have whole wheat flour and just used all regular gluten free flour that might have affected the thickness as well plus i added a teaspoon of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon and topped them with blueberries and raspberries these were really wonderful not as heavy as i thought people said in other reviews but definitely filling really great recipe and definitely a family pleaser
5,ive been making these for a long time and they are still a family favorite very thick but easily diluted with a spoon of buttermilk i used to double the recipe and freeze any leftovers between double layers of waxed paper served with warm maple syrup even reheated these are fantastic
5,used all king arthur white flour and left out the oatmeal they were delicious
5,the kids loved these pancakes theyre fairly hearty so i feel like theyre better at filling them up before school than a regular pancake ill definitely make these again
5,i made brown sugar oatmeal pancakes this past saturday morning for overnight guests i didnt have whole wheat flour so i used all white flour i also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract everyone loved them
5,only used all purpose flour made half the batch as is then added blueberries to the remainder delicious will make a double batch next time and freeze them
5,this is my favorite macaroni salad its so yummy i use green peppers instead of celery its a crowd pleaser i make it several times during summer time
5,great flavor and texture though i must agree with some of the other reviews its closer to a chowder than a chili i added cup of mozzerella cheese when i added the cream and let it simmer about min more it thickened it and rounded out all the flavors great dish ill be making it again
5,ive made this chili several times everyone who has tried it absolutely loves it its a huge winner for me
5,i made this chili for the first time last year at a chili cookoff at work we were doing a fundraiser for the north texas food bank i didnt win but i had several people ask for the recipe they loved it it was devoured in minuteswell i made it again last night and entered it in the chili cookoff again today wellthere were entries and i won rd place again had many tell me how they loved it and asked for the recipei love this chili but i do have one secret that i cannot share
5,i havent tried this recipe but feel i can give it a five star rating because i have a very similar recipe which everyone enjoys the only difference is that i use tbsp of fresh cilantro in place of the oregano and cups of shredded monterey jack in place of the whipping cream and cut the sour cream to cup i also cut back the pepper and cayenne pepper because my family doesnt like foods too hot
5,wonderful
5,
5,i made this last night and it was amazing both my husband and i loved it i did not have sour cream on hand so i just added extra heavy cream and it was great this will now be in my fallwinter go tomeals it really was a quick meal prep too
5,this was delicious the only changes i made was reducing the amount of sour cream and adding an extra can of northern beans
5,this recipe is amazing i will definitely be making again
5,terrific used this for a dinner party and everyone walked away with the recipe didnt change anything about the recipe
5,we really liked this recipe and the only change i made was adding rd can of beans after reading the other reviews next time i make this chili i will decrease the amount of sour cream and i will keep the pan on the stove after adding the sour cream amp heavy whipping cream otherwise it cools the dish to lukewarm this is a unique and flavorful meal
5,very good will make again i added more beans just my personal preference
5,best white chili recipe in town ive been making this for or so years i do not take it anywhere where i dont get asked for the recipe also if you do like it a little spicier you can buy hot chopped green chilies not jalapenos instead of the regular mild ones
5,this white chilli was really good just seasoned very well i was low on great white bean so made with half black eyed peas and half great white from dried beans cook the beans first will be making this again yummy wow
5,can you make this without the beans
5,i made these last night for dinner with eggs and ham they were the lightest and most flavorful pancakes ive ever seen the wonderful nutty sweet flavor is sadly hidden when you add the syrup although you dont need much and butteri got pancakes from the recipe using the c measure i didnt have wheat flour so made them with c allpurpose flour and it worked fine i read a review about the cakes being dry that is my thought on using wheat flour i have never made anything with it that hasnt turned out terrible dry so im wondering if her cakes were dry from the wheat flour and not the oatmealhere is something i tried for the first time and i was amazed i never buy buttermilk so was reading the other day to see if my method of adding t lemon juice to c of milk is a close substitute the article said that it is fine but sometimes will give off the taste of the lemon they suggested the closest sub to buttermilk is to add tsp cream of tartar to the dry ingredients for very cup of milk they said it is very hard to find any differences in using that compared to products made with buttermilk maybe thats why they were so light they nearly floated off the plate
5,these were wonderful light and fluffy but still filling great tasting
5,my husband and i try to eat healthy when i saw this recipe we love pancakes i decided to make them but i did make a few changes i replaced the whole wheat flour with white whole wheat which is not as bitter as whole wheat flour and the brown sugar with a tablespoon of agave syrup which gave it a little more moisture i also replaced the vegetable oil with the same amount of extra light olive oil and added teaspoon of vanilla the pancakes yum you could also replace the brown sugar with a tablespoon of pure maple syrup which would give it a little more brown sugar taste i never use whole wheat flour anymore i strictly use the white whole wheat which can be used in recipes calling for whole wheat flour
5,ive made these many times now they are hearty and tasty ive begun adding a chopped apple and a handful of chopped walnuts to the batter takes it up another notch because this batter is so thick i cook them at a slightly lower temp on the griddle otherwise they tend to get overly brown on the outside before the inside is done i use buttermilk powder stirring the powder in with the dry ingredients and using cup of water with the other wet ingredients egg and oil as long as i have all of the ingredients on the counter i make up several batches of the dry ingredients in zipper bags and store them in the refrigerator makes a really quick and easy meal any time of the day
5,just made these as directed except i added a mashed up banana and they were great my three boys gobbled these up and wanted more
5,these pcakes are a wonderful grab and go brkfast i add walnuts and raisins amp munch with my morning coffee
5,very good pancakes added about tablespoons of milk a little at a time slightly chewy because of the oatmeal but tasty and sweet needed very little syrup on top pancakes were light but very filling will process the oatmeal next time to see if i like them better will also add some vanilla next time for added flavor added blueberries to the mixture also used white wheat flour as that is what i had will use this recipe again
5,great recipe will definitely make again
5,loved these used skim milk lemon juice in place of the buttermilk and half of the brown sugar and these still turned out amazing hearty and slightly sweet i cooked half the batch with blueberries and served the other half plain topped with fresh berries definitely a new favorite
5,okay so i should start out by saying that i added a few things to this recipe i made the recipe as listed and then i added an extra glug of buttermilk a capful of each almond and vanilla extract and a very ripe banana also i didnt want to wash my cup so i eyeballed the brown sugar i ended up leaving it in the mixing bowl to soften up the oats for maybe minutes while i started coffee and then threw that batter on a griddle cooked those puppies up and inhaled while they were still warm and covered in smashed strawberries and blackberries the recipe made goodsized pancakes that were soft fluffy and tasted a little like banana bread im sold
5,the best pancakes bar none i added some craisins phenomenal
5,very good flavor and texture
5,wow these are amazing sweet enough on their own that syrup is unnecessary i like them with applesauce my month old is a pancake nut and he loved these this recipe is definitely going in my recipe book
5,i make these about times a week they are delicious and very filling i leave out the brown sugar and add a little more than cup of craisins and also add teaspoon of vanilla i have also made them with the brown sugar included great this way too but they do brown quicker they are wonderful served with real maple syrup
5,these are awesome very filling great tasting pancake i did find that buttermilk made them almost too thick so i use t lemon juice in c of regular milk plan to try adding vanilla as some have suggested and maybe a few chocolate chips yum
5,my family made faces when i told them what i was making now these are the only pancakes they want to have
5,delicious i did swap out the all purpose flour for buckwheat flour and added a handful of pumpkin seeds but otherwise made them as written definitely tasty enough to forgo the syrup and very filling
5,super delicious the only thing was i found was they burned really quickly didnt impact the flavour at all though served them with fresh made strawberry syrup from this site
5,i run the oats through my magic bullet so it is more of an oat flour
5,great recipe i added vanilla to the batter and pulsed the oats a bit in the food processor before adding to the rest of the dry ingredients i will definitely make these again
5,delicious my husband was a skeptic with the oatmeal in the batter but was quickly won over they are very filling and need only a small bit of syrup
5,this was a hit at my house and very easy to make i didnt have the wheat flour handy so i used more of the regular flour i see you are able to freeze and reheat i was hoping to make the silver dollar version of this for a ladies brunch im having to save time was wondering if i can make them all the night before cool and freeze them and then use the reheating instructions would love to hear from someone who has tried to reheat and how they measured up
5,made these for breakfast this morning big hit nicely sweet just used a little syrup doubled the recipe and got pancakes
5,these have the perfect combination of sweetness i love how it uses whole wheat and oatmeal im always trying to find new ways to eat whole grains and i love these pancakes as a way to do so
5,the best pancake ever and i dontdidnt like pancakes i followed the recipe exactly then added cinnamon at the last minute no syrup necessary delicious
5,yum loved them i followed the recipe exactly other than the buttermilk i used a cup of milk soured w tablespoon vinegar the recipe only made pancakes plus one tiny pancake but they are very filling
5,this was excellent i substituted of the brown sugar with splenda to lower the sugar content added a little less than t salt and they tasted great very filling my batch made inch pancakes which were plenty plus since it didnt make too many i wasnt standing over the stove too long will definitely make again thank you for the healthier breakfast food
5,this is a keeper it not only went in my online recipe box at toh but on a x card into my real recipe box i didnt have buttermilk so used lowfat milk with lemon juice and just a pinch of salt since im cutting back on salt i like to make pancakes and freeze them so i have a quick breakfast already ready to eat i ended up eating three of these before i got them all made if you need a quick breakfast freeze these individually take one out put in a bowl put yogurt on it and frozen fruit and walnuts or pecans cover and put in fridge next morning its ready to eat sprinkle cinnamon on it thanks for sharing your recipe its good and is high in fiber also
5,my husband is not a pancake lover but it has now changed after i tried this recipe i make a batch of these every weekend and he eats them through the week for breakfast i love the fact they have oatmeal i add blueberries for him deelicious
5,my kids have texture issues so we grind down the oats to a flour and they love this recipe a new family favorite
5,delicious my mom doubles the recipe and makes these for my kids they love them they request them for dinner frequently
5,mmm very very good the taste reminded me of doughnut the mixture made me seveneight pancakes i hoped theyd be filling with the oats but two didnt seem enough though i did stop at two i could have ganneted the whole lot super
5,very good
5,this is my go to pancake recipe wednesday morning is pancake day at our house
5,fantastic i added tsp each of cinnamon vanilla and baking powder and used melted butter instead of oil they taste like oatmeal cookies i got small pancakes out of it and my husband and i ate them all no need for syrup
5,great just read the recipe and threw them together delicious no syrup necessary
5,my family loves this recipe and these fill my kids up faster than traditional pancakes my kids still insist on syrup but they are sweet enough to have them plain i like them with unsweetened applesauce
5,love this recipe i place all the dry ingredients in an airtight container with the instructions for preparation taped to the outside of the container just add the wet ingredients and you have your own prepared pancake mix makes for a quicker preparation when my family comes for weekend visits
5,excellent will make again i doubled the recipe and it made exactly pancakes with cup of batter each these are a hearty sticktoyourribs kind of pancake because of the oatmeal
5,this is one of the best pancake recipes ever we have made them over and over again i serve them with the amish breakfast casserole and my family thinks i am just wonderful i have to triple the recipe
5,made these this morningawesome best pancakes i think ive ever had the recipe says it makes but that must be really small pancakes i made the recipe and a half and got eight to inch pancakes i did throw in a handful of walnuts also which added a nice texture to an already delicious pancake also i didnt have quick cooking oatmeal just the regular and the substitution was fine highly recommend these pancakes and thanks for sharing this recipe
5,also since these are so flavorful on their own i used sliced bananas as the only topping yummy hubby liked his with greek yogurt
5,substituted c low fat vanilla yogurt and a little over c milk for the buttermilk tasted fantastic and needed no syrup served with a dollop of whipped cream and the kids went wild definitely will be our new goto pancake recipe
5,these were delicious very filling if i had made each pancake or then i might have gotten pancakes but i did not i had some big ones for me and little ones for the my kids i added a tablespoon of melted butter in place of one tablespoon of oil but it probably wasnt necessary i also added a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon and was really glad i did wonderful
5,i made this as a mothers day breakfast for my sweetheart recently she loved it and everyone else loved it as well i would most assuredly make this again even for a normal weekend breakfast thank you very much for the recipe loved it
5,i would like to add that i aslo used jemimies idea with the bannana sliced in thirds lengthwise then shaved slices off to curl across the top these were absolutely fabulous pancakes
5,these were great i didnt use as much brown sugar as i thought they might be too sweet next time i will use the right amount my husband thought they were great i think this will become our new go to recipe for pancakes
5,absolutely delicious i have tried many pancakes from these recipes and i love all of them cant really choose just one favorite
5,these were the perfect addition to our breakfast for dinner meal they have a bit of a dry texture but soak up the syrup well and become moist a homemade chocolate sauce or something similar would be divine over the top to pair with the brown sugar and oatmeal flavor i might try that the next time
5,these were delicious the batter was very thick and only made cup pancakes for me my daughter who normal doesnt like pancakes ate these all up
5,these are soooo good i have made them or times since finding the recipe cant wait to try them with warmed apples slices this fall this recipe is a keeper
5,these are delicious definitely my goto pancake recipe
5,very good cooked my own beans and used jalapeo ground pepper instead of cayenne pepper delicious
5,y family loved this
5,i made this in the crock pot changes i made two frozen chicken breasts in crock potsauteed onion and minced garlic doubled the broth and never added the heavy cream or sour creamcooked on low for hours it turned out great
5,this is a wonderful recipe and simple to make all the ingredients blend well together and it is a great alternative to regular chili it is also super tasty the next day and reheats well thanks
5,great recipe nd time making it however it comes out like a soup i added wondra flour to achieve a thicker chili consistency love it this one is in my recipe collection thank you i did make this recipe again on nov even when i added a extra can of beans and mashed them prior to adding i still needed to thicken with flour for more of a chili consistency however still an awesome recipe
5,we love this chili recipe i always have to double it so we can have leftovers
5,i used one less can of green chilies glory seasoned northern beans and omitted the salt very good the glory brand beans added much needed flavor frittos on top to add a little crunch and salt yummy
5,
5,i have made this chili recipe several times and it never fails to impress my only change is omitting the cayenne pepper great recipe
5,i have made this recipe several times and i love it the first time i used chicken breast second time i used ground chicken the ground chicken definitely made it feel more like chili but i like them both the changes i made along the way omit one can of green chilies add one can of beans which i then use to mash against the pot with a spoon to get a thicker consistency more like chili added some dried cilantro and a little more seasoning to taste to compensate for the extra beans yummy add some cornbread and youre done quick and easy
5,this is a favorite in our home especially on cold days during winter we have it regularly it has wonderful flavor i use all ingredients except i add a little bit of white chicken chili seasoning to it and put it in crock pot to cook at last add sour cream and whipping cream enjoy
5,i have been making this chili for several years now i make it exactly as written i sometimes have a little more chicken than one pound as its hard to get a package of chicken breast that is lb i just usually use breasts so sometimes its a little more when making for company i have added one more can of beans it is delicious my advice to someone making it for the first time is make it exactly as written and then make any adjustments you want for next time
5,these were fantastic very easy and healthy i loved how they were very filling i definitely would recommend this
5,a unique spin on pancakes every time i make these for a brunch or breakfast potluck everyone wants the recipe
5,a new fav in our house i used only wheat flour and also added cinnamon and nutmegmy husband absolutely loves them
5,we were just sad this didnt make more i would not call this servings it was just barely enough for the of us and my son is only
5,absolutely delicious will definitely be making them alot more
5,awesome pancakes are an alltime fav here at our house these are more wholesome and healthier than the kind i usually make thank you for sharing this fantastic recipe
5,these are very good happylady and avildayou should not be worried about that little bit of salt if you leave out the salt the only effect on the recipe would be that it wouldnt taste as good i cant believe that you dont use any salt at all and that would be that bad for you
5,in spite of no buttermilk used greek unflavored yogurt so doubled the milk and added cinnamon the pancakes turned out to be delicious this recipe is a keeper and will be repeated thanks for sharing sharon
5,for the of us old folks this recipe is too much because it is so filling so next time i will halve the ingredients i forgot the salt but we didnt miss it very good
5,delicious and for those who are concerned about the salt the ratio of salt to amont of flour and oats is perfect
5,this is one of the best pancake recipes ever we have made them over and over again i serve them with the amish breakfast casserole and my family thinks i am just wonderful
5,this was quite delicious i juiced limes used the other half of a lime for garnish which was about tbsp i cut back on the chili powder about tsp and instead of mixing them i sprinkled the powder on each piece of chicken then poured in the lime juice i cooked it for hours shredded the chicken and added in the salsa and corn then only cooked it all for an additional minutes or so while my sides finished cooking the chicken was perfect i could actually taste the lime but it wasnt overpowering i will be doing the same ratio next time we really loved this recipe and it tasted great topped with some lettuce chopped tomatoes and avocado ill definitely be doing this one again
5,this was so good and so easy to put together the lime was very subtle we topped the tacos with sautéed red and green pepper strips and onions which is a favorite we also used lettuce chunks of avocado and of course sharp cheddar cheese i doubled the recipe and had plenty of the chicken mixture to freeze for a later meal when grandkids stop over
5,chicken was real good
5,this recipe was so easy to make and tasted absolutely deliciousi cant wait to make it again
5,always go to recipes so easy especially with homemade salsa thrown in even my picky eaters love this
5,quick easy and yummy recipe lime in dishes is a favorite at our house cooked the chicken until tender and done on the stovetop then added the rest of the filling ingredients to heat through topped filled tortillas with sour cream shredded cheddar cheese lettuce tomatoes amp taco sauce
5,i rubbed chili powder cumin paprika and oregano on the outside and cooked it in the slow cooker with cup of lime juice for to hours on low cooks faster in liquid comes out juicy delicious and limey i followed the recipe after that very delicious ive never had lime chicken before but this was amazing even my year old went crazy saying these were the best tacos ive ever made thanks for the inspiration
5,these are well worth trying you wont regret it i used one cup of allpurpose flour because i didnt have any wheat they were simply delicious
5,i made four taste of home pancake recipes recently and i like this one the best when i make them next time ill probably add some more buttermilk otherwise they were great hearty pancakes you would never know there is wheat flour in them
5,i made these pancakes for breakfast and added chocolate chips as i was cooking themas hubby is a choc a holic we thought they were great
5,very easy to make used whole milk instead of buttermilk cause its what i had on hand added a tsp of cinnamon and some freshly grated nutmeg as well they are very filling and tasty
5,these pancakes are so delicious and filling i added two ripe bananas cinnamon and nutmeg which eliminated the need for syrup this will be my go to recipe from now on thank you
5,this will become my new goto pancake recipe i loved the taste and they dont get so soggy from the syrup i did use only white flour instead of the whole wheat and i found we needed to add a little more buttermilk to make the batter the right consistency excellent recipe thanks
5,so easy to make but absolutely delicious one of our favorites
5,these are great the only change i made was to add a can of black beans
5,very good i cooked for hours and meat was starting to dry out next time i will check it at hours i had to use mainly salsa verde since i didnt have enough tomato based salsa and i did add a little salt
5,i was really impressed with this i had just over lbs of chicken breasts and after pretty much exactly hours exactly it shredded incredibly easily the flavor was really good too ive never been one to put salsa on my tacos or burritos im more of a pico de gallo person this was super good it also made enough that im going to definitely get more than a few meals out of it easy quick and cheapby the way i bought a can of corn accidentally got creamed corn and while this was the first time i made this so i dont know how its supposed be exactly i dont think it changed anything the salsa has enough liquid that it got absorbed without an issueim definitely making this again
5,made the recipe exactly as written but cut in half for just of us used mild salsa as we arent big heat fans and kept the lime juicechili powder ratio as is wonderful we decided this is definitely a keeper and will be made again and again so easy so quick after chicken was cooked yumyum
5,very easy and delicious great fast meal love the lime flavor
5,love this have been making it for years and shared it many many times since it first appeared in the magazine
5,cant wait to try this im from boise too
5,this was delicious it makes for a great meal that is quick and easy to make i did up some peppers and onions to go with it
5,this recipe has been a favorite of ours for years quick easy amp great flavor i use the leftover chicken to make enchiladas
5,this a fantastic family summertime recipe the chicken is jammed packed with flavora true family favorite
5,tasty quick meal with lots of options
5,we made this chicken for a taco bar for a friends rehearsal dinner we left out the corn and chili powder to help it appeal to even the pickiest guests it was moist and delicious with just the right amount of lime flavor coming through i used jacks garden fresh fresh salsa and i think that boosted the flavor compared to jarred chunky salsa this is a keeper the leftovers freeze great as well
5,i like this recipe toss it in the crockpot
5,this is absolutely the best chicken chili i have made it for several different friends and everyone just loves it i make it exactly as the recipe statesdelicious
5,i too loved this chili made a few minor changes per reviewers additional can of beans a little less sour cream and heavy cream since it does turn out a bit soupy i serve it over rice or a baked or mashed potato everyone who tries it loves it
5,entered this chili in a chili cookoff contest and won everyone loved it made the recipe exactly as written i did smash one can of the beans to help thicken it up a bit
5,this was really good easy to make and great on a chilly night loved the flavor thanks for sharing i will definitely make again
5,so yummy i like to use fresh garlic in place of garlic powder cloves i also use cups chicken broth one can chilies and one can rotel to this recipe
5,i have made this twice now for soup suppers at church and everyone loves it the only thing that i found was that the sour cream doesnt want to mix in without being clumpy so next time ill whisk the sour cream and whipping cream together first to help loosen up the sour cream hopefully it will mix in more smoothly great recipe
5,i loved this recipe i added some red pepper flakes and probably would add a little more next time it does come out a little soupy so i may try smashing some of the beans next time or using a little less broth the sour cream and heavy cream added to the wonderful flavor i served over brown rice which was a fantastic pair
5,this is a wonderfully rich and creamy chili that is quite different from other white chili recipes ive tasted it has been a hit every time ive made it i made two changes to the original recipe based on the reviews i read here i add a third can of northern beans and mash them to add thickness to the chili also instead of cooking a pound of boneless chicken breasts i use the breast meat from a storebought rotisserie chicken costco in my case the breast meat is already seasoned so no need for the garlic powder and canola oil i dice up the meat into cubes a little smaller than the original recipe one of the easiest chilis ive ever made and so delicious
5,easy to prepare great alternative to standard chili receipt i add sour cream later on once it is served otherwise fantastic receipt
5,this a an awesome recipe i shredded my chicken and it was even better the second daywhole family and staff loved it would not change a thing
5,ive made this recipe several times for my family we leave out the chicken for vegetarian style and serve it over baked potatoes rice or quinoa they love it every time
5,i love it everyone in my home loves it and i have been asked for the recipe many times i have to triple the recipe for my family it is very easy to make
5,wow this is a winner very tasty with just the right amount of heat after cooking the chicken and onions on the stove i put everything in my crock pot for hours on low i was using fatfree sour cream so i mixed that with tbsp of cornstarch to keep it from separating and i didnt have any heavy cream so i left that out but it was plenty creamy without it i wouldnt change anything else we really loved this recipe
5,had to try this when i saw how many reviews it had i left out the whipping cream it turned out really great
5,very easy and really good a nice change of pace from regular tacos
5,made for a luncheon and everyone really liked it i did add chopped cilantro and cup of concentrated limeade since i really like lime and cilantro
5,made this for children and adults the only change suggested was to add a bit of cilantro
5,a simple recipe that lends itself to adapting to personal tastes i liked the lime flavornext time will add more lime i had to leave out the corn for dietary restrictionsvery very tasty
5,our family loved it so easy and delicious
5,i added fresh salsa and the corn at the beginning of the cook time and it really marinated the chicken well this made it very tender and shredded with ease it was absolutely delish
5,i make this recipe all the time i always double it so i have leftover meat to use in other recipes i put the salsa in at the very beginning at the end i shred the chicken add cans of rinsed and drained black beans and can of drained corn this meat works perfectly for enchiladas spicy taco soup just add chicken broth amp a can of rotel top with tortilla chips amp cheese and is great for quesadillas just drain the juice add cheese amp toast its really an excellent recipe and base for lots of other recipes my family loves it
5,i made the recipe as written very tasty even my picky husband liked it

5,so good and it makes enough to feed a large family
5,family loved it there was still a lot of room in the crock pot and it was popular would easily double for a party or double and freeze leftovers
5,this is a staple in my house now such an easy meal to fix and it tastes great my children are huge fans
5,this is a great goto recipe for our family ive also used it to serve supper to our church youth group and for a meal for families with new babies etci also use the lime juice amp chili powder mixture from this recipe to marinate chicken strips fast amp easy and they dont need to marinate for very long to pick up the flavor
5,so so so easy and very tasty we topped with cheese and shredded lettuce
5,this is a favorite in our family

5,when my grown picky kids go back for nd and rds i know i have a keeper i dont know about the servings at my house
5,so delicious and so easy to make instead of using a slow cooker we cooked the chicken over the stove in a little bit of chicken broth they were absolutely delicious
5,this is a great recipe as written family loved it i want to make this without the beans as my husband is on a special diet that allows basically no fiber i am thinking of using pork in place of chicken and white potatoes in place of beans wondering if anyone has changed it around like this as long as the flavor is there i would think this would work any suggestions are appreciated
5,my husband is a chili lover he was however disappointed when i said we were having white chicken chili i left out the whipping cream and the recipe was fine as is when he ate it he was amazed and absolutely loved it this recipe is a keeper
5,i won yet another chili cookoff with this recipe last weekend its a keeper for sure
5,delicious this is definitely one of our favorites
5,i used canned chicken even faster and easier a new family favorite
5,i created an account simply to post this review thats how good this chili is i made it as described and it was seriously amazing i personally wouldnt change a thing i plan on making it again this weekend for out of town family thatll be staying with us dont hesitate to make this
5,make this youll be happy you did
5,an extraordinary recipe we all loved this chili one of the better white chili recipes ive tried
5,delicious i loved it because it skips the tomatoes which im tired of lately every quick dish is buried in tomato saucehad to improvise only had can of chilies added a tsp of chipotle to make up for it half breast wasnt a pound was a little over the extra bit of meat was a bonusdont always have heavy cream on hand had to leave it out but used a bit of whole milkserved it with crispy garlic texas toastthis is worth expanding for a crowd its a nice change from red chili that seems to be the rage
5,i was looking for a chili with a white sauce because the tomato sauce gives me heartburn so does the white but not as bad when i found this and made it for the first time now my family cant get enough of it its not difficult to make at all and heartburn yeah probably but who cares this stuff is the bomb thanks for the recipe its a hit and a change from the regular hamburger and red sauce its my new chili go to
5,this was very easy and very good im not sure that it yields servings if served as a main course likely closer to certainly precooked chicken or turkey could be used for even further ease making it a great recipe for leftovers i used cannellini beans and part of me thought they werent hearty enough i almost wanted to replace the beans with potatobut then i guess it wouldnt be chili either way i will certainly make it again
5,this is great on a chilly overcast day my brother asked for this recipe
5,this is a wonderfully tasty chili i got tired of tomato sauce so this was a nice change the first time i made this i tripled it for a family gathering and everyone loved it i only put in half the chili amount though it did get a bit soupy but i just let it simmer longer
5,really good recipe however after adding the sour cream and heavy cream it did get soupy after adding the creams i ended up putting it back on low heat to warm it back up and then added a teaspoon or so of corn starch to thicken it up worked perfectly
5,this was great i just added my own touch as always more spices and roasted garlic and a secret ingredient
5,what a super easy recipe i love cream of mushroom soup but had never made it from scratch im with some other posters it is a bit bland on the first try i added more salt and pepper with a teaspoon of minced garlic it was delicious i may try adding extra seasoning on the next round definitely adding this to my soup files
5,my husband said this was a mistake to make through all the yummy noises he managed to say it was bc i going to have to make this all the time he always crushes up crackers in any and all soups i make but not this time i did add one clove of garlic chopped the mushrooms into small pieces and this was indeed an exceptional recipe highly recommend this easy and quick to make soup ty anne kulick and taste of home for the delish recipe
5,this recipe is wonderful thanks anne and thanks to your daughterinlaw

5,pi made this tonight because it just sounded comforting and i had the ingredients on hand it was simply delightful i halved the recipe because im only cooking for one and i wanted leftovers for tomorrow i did add a little bit more salt and pepper but thats personal preference and i know many watch their sodium intake this is definitely staying in rotation after tasting it i felt no need to add garlic or hot sauce or anything else i love that mushroom taste and had no need to mask it thank you for an amazing recipep

5,this recipe is outstandingly goodand easy for the health conscious you can substitute milk for cream and it is still delicious the addition of thyme marjoram and oregano spices it up a little the use of multiple mushroom types adds a mix of textures and flavors this is an outstanding recipe that could be built on in many ways next time i will try adding chicken thank you for sharing it
5,we had this tonight amp it was very good i made as directed with a small pinch of oregano amp thyme plus a little extra thickener it was yummy amp i will make again
5,this soup is wonderful full of flavor and surprisingly simple i made a couple small adjustments to the original recipe which are as follows i doubled the amount of mushrooms to pound using a mixed variety of mushrooms and i used a large onion chopped otherwise everything else was as written i like a lot of mushrooms in mushroom soup and pound was not nearly enough
5,i love this recipe i substituted liter of mushroom broth for the chicken broth for extra mushroom flavor
5,just made this delicious i double the recipe amp did with chicken broth amp chicken stock my family isnt fond of mushrooms per se so when it was all done i puréed it in the blender easy amp so good
5,very good simple recipe perfect for cold winter days i substitute chicken with vegetable stock but otherwise make according to directions would highly recommend
5,yummy quick and easy soup i added a pkg of gnocchi to mine
5,like laura i used a variety of mushrooms lb a whole finely chopped sweet onion and then tsp thyme in addition to the basic recipe it has excellent flavor and texture and is so easy to make too
5,super yummy did this with almond milk and tsp thyme and tsp rosemary best soup ever im vegetarian so i cant do canned but this beats campbells cream of mushroom soup any time

5,i have made this for years and it never gets old
5,made this soup a few days ago wow very easy to make and very flavorful this will be a staple in my house
5,i just made this soup love it first time making a creamed soup but it was easy i did cheat a little used table cream and more than called for as i wanted to use it up before christmas will definitely make this again
5,this soup is absolutely delicious fir some reason i always thought mushroom soup was hard to makewell i couldnt have been more wrong simple and the results are crowd pleasing i made it for a potluck and xd the recipie i also substituted corn starch for the flourused less and my gluten free friends were also able to enjoy
5,i have made this upwards of times for my family if they see mushrooms on sale they beg me to make this soup i should note that my says doesnt like mushrooms and my wife doesnt like mushroom soup they both still ask me to make this every other week
5,i was a little worried after taste tasting after i added the flour it really tasted like flour didnt give up it did say to simmer to let the flavors meld glad i did it was really tasty may add some portobellos and a titch of sherry next time low calories for a creamy soup added benefit thanks anne and other cooks who gave me the thumbs up to try it
5,love this soup i have doubled or tripled the mushrooms added sausage or chopped chicken and used heavy cream i make it at least twice to three times a month
5,wow so easy and delicious made it twice already this month love it i added extra mushrooms i used cornstarch slurry to help thicken the taste is amazing
5,i just made this for the second time in a week omg it is great and easy i saw asparagus on sale and thought again omg i also made a double batch my husband doesnt eat mushrooms but my best friend does and we are glad not to share with more
5,wow if you havent tried this simple recipe then its time you do so easy to make and the flavor is amazing the recipe itself is greatbut like a couple of other reviewers i added a little bit of garlic powder and a splash of olive oil thank you for sharing anne

5,i always have these ingredients on hand which is great i dont have to run to the store when i want to make mushroom soup thank you
5,very good and quick i used shallots didnt have onions and also added some fresh minced garlic and a splash of sherry when the mushrooms and shallots were just about finished cooking also added some dried thyme heavy cream and squeezed in some fresh lemon juiceyum
5,this is without a doubt the best cream a mushroom soup recipe i have ever had i dont know if its because i used my own homemade chicken broth but it is hands down the best i could not stop eating it while it was still in the pan mmm good
5,super fantastic my hubby needed something hearty but liquid and this did the trick i did read through the comments and did some changes first i started with crimini mushrooms when the onions and mushrooms were cooked i added crushed roasted garlic and dried thyme i also added a splash cup of sherry to the broth let it boil for about min then added whipping cream some more butter another splash of sherry and some fresh lemon juice shimmered for about hr pulled out a cup of mushrooms then used the immersion blender to what it was in the pot added back the mushrooms set aside did add just a little cornstarch to thicken it a little bit more the extra cooking allowed the flavor to developed definitely a keeper recipe
5,ive never made mushroom soup before and im glad i made this recipe i absolutly loved it the only thing i did different is add garlic powder and thyme
5,this gets stars for pushing me in the right direction although i also made very few changes based on earlier reviews doubled the recipe meaning i doubled almost every ingredient because hubby loves cream of mushroom soup and i had a lot of mushrooms i needed to use the only ingredient i didnt double was the flour i also added cooking sherry which works just fine i used tbsp butter melted then added the onion and cooked for about minutes then the flour which i quickly stirred so it was almost a roux but it was very dry so thats when i tossed in about tsp or so of cooking sherry next i added oz of chicken broth mixed of swansons organic and some homemade leftovers and the mushrooms i added some thyme because in my world pretty much every mushroom dish is a little bit better with thyme for this i added about tsp then i let it simmer until the onions and mushrooms were soft note i did not add salt when the onions and mushrooms were soft i added a bit of the broth to a combo of c half
5,easy and delicious
5,can nestle cream be a substitute for the halfhalf cream loved the original recipe though tasty and very simple
5,omg so easy and good
5,this is a winner i used kinda of mushrooms and a lot of extras sooo good
5,i make a couple of changes to it it was good before but now omg first make your own broth then use whole cream not half and half its makes so creamy
5,is gud
5,easy and delicious added a bit of garlic powder and splash of extra virgin olive oil yum
5,we do not buy any store bought soup anymore this is very easy to make and it is so good i do add a bot of garlic powder and skip the onions and it turns out so good
5,i just made this according to the recipe was worried the onion would be too strong or that there would be too earthy of a flavor with the mushrooms boy was i wrong it was delicious and perfect it was like a thick gravy im going to serve it over biscuits next time yummy
5,very good i will never buy can again
5,used mushroom stock instead of chicken stock also added half tablespoon better than bullion mushroom concentrate turned out great
5,this soup is amazing i used it to make green bean casserole and i will never buy canned cream of mushroom soup again im going to try making cream of chicken soup next i never realized what a difference the homemade version would be thanks so much for the killer recipy
5,great recipe i almost ate the whole thing myself
5,i loved this recipe it was perfect although i did add a little minced garlic this is a keeper
5,you just saved my sunday dinner i had no cream of mushroom soup in stock and found this works perfect needs nothing different added thank you
5,excellent how would you double this soup
5,normally i make a new recipe as written but i had sooooo many mushrooms and onions doubled the butter mushrooms and onion and left the remaining ingredients as is omstars i love this so very muchlt i thought id have to get my immersion blender going but nope perfect
5,great and easy recipe i made it just like the recipe the first time i made just two little changes the second time i cooked it i took half the mushrooms out and pureed the other half in the soup with my immersion blender then returned the rest to the pot that helped thicken the soup a lot it also made it a little creamier when i used heavy cream instead of half and half
5,quick is right quick and tasty is even better i used white button mushrooms and baby bella mushrooms i used evaporated milk and cornstartch instead of the flour making it slightly healthier i also used it not only as a soup but after tasting the rich earthiness i decided to use it as a saucegravy my choice for this test salisbury steaks it could not have been more perfect one more taste of home winner fort he new yearvolunteer taste of home field editor
5,delicious i had about a pound of baby bella mushrooms that i needed to use up and happened to come accross this recipe made a double batch i was out of chicken broth so i used vegetable broth used fat free half and half because thats what i had on hand
5,this recipe is absolutely what i wanted cream of mushroom is one of my favorite soups but ive always been intimidated to try making it myself i assumed it was time consuming this was super easy and came out perfect the only changes i made was i used oz of chicken broth which made it thinner which i wanted and i also used a full pound of sliced baby bella mushrooms id definitely do this recipe again and again
5,i love this recipe and so does my husband the base works for any vegetablejust change up the spices its great with asparagus and add a pinch of celery salt i really dont think you need to use cream use whole milk and its still really yummy and thick but not so overly rich a dash of sherry makes it super elegant for a dinner partydont use cooking sherry just regular cheap brand drinking sherry dont overdo ita splash will do this is a really flexible recipe that can be used for lots of soup bases so helpful and im sure ill use it a lot in the future
5,love this soup its simple and easy i love to add garlic salt and lemon thyme
5,i have celiac so finding cream soups that dont contain flour is next to impossible i used cornstarch instead of flour and i will never buy any other mushroom soup this can be used for anything and i absolutely love it
5,its a lazy sunday between christmas and new years and im indulging in my favorite things reading recipes cooking and reading my library book this soup recipe called out to me as i have all ingredients and it is perfect for this cold day i deviated just a bit by adding the flour to the vegetables as they were cooking in the butter i also added a finely chopped stalk of celery because i needed to use it and thought it would enhance the soup i used evaporated again because thats what i had available i thought the soup needed a little something so i added a sprinkling of thyme and poultry seasoning i will make this again and again with this modifications stars and thumbs up im enjoying a mug of the creamy soup right now as i watch a movie lynne toh volunteer field editor
5,this recipe is so easy and so delicious i have made it several times both to eat on its own and to use in other recipes i too had problems with the flour taste and so i tried using corn starch and that solved the problem i actually think the overall texture of the soup is better using the corn starch this soup will be a staple in our household delicious and healthy
5,made this recipe as a side for our bbq this was delicious quick amp easy my husband loved it
5,i love this it was a little thin next time i will add a little more flour i did make a roux with the flour first to cook it off and used baby bella mushrooms will definitely make this again i did not taste any flour as some have
5,i was in the mood for cream of mushroom soup and found this recipe and decided to make it i only had one package of button mushrooms red onion and sautéed them in the butter i only had a oz carton of organic low sodium vegetable broth and i used the tablespoons of flour in it did not notice the flour taste i did let it cook for a while i did not have any cream only skim milk and it came out really good for my taste it had a nice creamy texture cream may be too heavy for me i also had a cooked chicken breast and cut that up and put in as well i also used mrs dash onion in it for a little kick i think this recipe is very easy quick and i will definitely make again and get more creative with it use more different types of mushrooms puree some and leave the rest chunky add some wine it was so fast to make yum i think i will use this recipe with broccoli as well might be fun
5,this soup was delicious i used baby bella mushrooms sliced very thin because others said it tasted like flour i only used tbsp of flour instead of mixing the flour with the broth i added an extra tablespoon of butter to the mushrooms when they were about finished then i mixed the flour in with the onion mushroom mix before adding the broth i also used a little bit more salt
5,i added strips of chopped bacon to the onions and used heavy whipping cream since i like my soup real thick i also use different types of thai mushrooms that i dont even know the names of due to their wonderful flavor because i used the bacon i didnt add any salt came out great and will use this recipe for the rest of my life
5,excellent soup i prepare very low sodium soup omitting the salt and using very low sodium chicken broth to make condensed soup add half the liquid g chicken broth and g halfandhalf ive prepared a scaled up condensed version freezing the left overs in oz g servings i use in any recipe calling for condensed soup
5,loved this recipe
5,loved the receipe i used plain mushrooms and yellow onion and it was great
5,i was looking for a cream soup to use in casseroles and stumbled upon this i just made it an its quick and delicious i followed the recipe exactly except i only had canned mushrooms in the house and yes i used those its still really good and beats the heck out of canned soups with canola oil and gmos in them i blended it with my immersion blender at the end to make the mushrooms smaller i did this for use in casseroles and the consistency is great next time i might add another tablespoon or of flour to make it thicker or reduce the liquid make sure you wisk the flour into the stock really well before adding it to pot and boil for a full minutes to cook out the flour taste i will definitely be using this recipe in the future and next time i will get fresh mushrooms looks like enough for casseroles so i will freeze the rest thanks
5,i think this was a great starter recipe really i dont like to read reviews that have altered the original buti needed to use portabella mushrooms and tarragon so im completely guilty of tweaking the results were wonderful and i can still hear some scraping of bowls thankyou
5,this soup is so easy to make but the taste seems like you have spent hours on it my husband and children love this soup
5,amazingly fast and amazingly delicious lovedloved this soup
5,delicious i make and let is sit in refrigerator over night husband brought home mushrooms and asked for this soup
5,my husband made this the other night for a crowd and it was delicious he did not add the jalapeno because we didnt know if all the people could handle or enjoy that agree with the reviewers about it being thin but you can add crackers at the table or just tweak with cornstarch sour cream or cream cheese
5,runner up in a chili cookoff however i did use a whole rotisserie chicken was very thick the way i wanted it based on the reviews below i did not want it to be thin crowd loved and i am almost certain i would have won if i hadnt run out people came back for seconds before the last people could judge it
5,i pretty much stuck to the recipe except i used leftover chicken i did use one can of chilies and skip the cayenne pepperso i guess i really didnt stick to the recipe it was good either way
5,i have made this chil several times i cook for bingo and everyone really likes it at first they were afraid to try it as they had never heard of it my family also thinks its great
5,love this chili since i dont like things too spicy i used less cayenne pepper and it was perfect
5,besides being delicious its greatest strengths are it soooooo easy and quick the only thing i did differently is used can of garbanzo beans and can of no beans didnt have cans of northerns i too simmered it a bit longer to make it more chililike
5,my family loves the chili i thought the beans might scare my little ones so i blended it in my immersion blender a bit the second time i made it i did not blend and everyone enjoyed it and requested seconds great recipe thanks for sharing
5,yum if you like really thick chili i would suggest cutting back on the stock and sour creamwhipping cream a bit and maybe the cayenne pepper too then or adding a bit of cornstarch to thicken or pureeing a portion as other reviewers mentioned but we thought it was really good as written just the right spiciness i cant tolerate much heat but this leaves just a little bite in your mouth after eating it orif its too thin maybe youre not simmering it long enough with the lid off
5,i made this chili for our super bowl party everyone raved about how good it was and requested the recipe the only thing i did differently was simmered it all day so the flavors could meld and the chicken would be super tender its not a real thick chili but that could easily be remedied by adding a little cornstarch if that bothers you otherwise this is a delicious recipe and im so glad i gave it a try its a keeper
5,loved it had a perfect little spice
5,excellent recipe easy and quick a keeper next time i may add some frozen corn joyce moynihan volunteer field editor
5,greta recipe used a rotisserie chicken when i made it
5,excellent i took the advice of a previous review and added tbsp of flour to the chicken onion garlic mix i used two jalapenos instead of the canned chilies i had to puree the beans only because my dh doesnt like the bean texture and i used butter beans lastly i used oz of cream cheese i had left in the fridge and a splash of heavy cream excellent
5,best recipe ever we all loved it and i have some picky eaters thank you for sharing so yummy and easy to make i didnt delete anything but added red pepper even without that change it would be amazing thank you for sharing a new family fav yesss
5,i made this delicious recipe yesterday for lunch and i know it will be even tastier reheated for lunch today one of our favorites thanks
5,delicious very easy to make one minor change i used corn starch instead of flour because i can usually taste the flour unless its cooked in a roux
5,my husband really likes mushroomsand always wanted me to make mushroom soupi could not find a good recipe until i found this one i was great fast really easy and had a great taste i sure that i will make it again and again
5,the perfect mushroom soup thank you
5,i thought this was excellent and so easy my husband said you scored we had this tonight with sandwiches great winter night supper will make this again for sure i cooked a couple of cloves with garlic with the onion but made no other changes
5,say good bye to can cream of mushroom soup i will be making this recipe from now on
5,love love love this i used a combo of types of mushrooms made a slurry of the mushroom mixture flour and cups of the chicken stock to cook out the flour taste warmed the remaining stock and then added the slurry to the hot stock stir often until thickened then add the cream and turn down to medlow and let simmer a few extra steps but oh so worth it
5,loved it avoided the flour taste by saute the onions in butter first then add a couple more tbsp of butter and add flour to that to make a roux with onions in it cook it for a few minutes to get rid of the flour taste if its too thick to stir add a bit more butter then proceed to add your liquid sauteed the mushrooms in a separate pot while the onions were cooking yeah dirty pans but avoided the floury taste by cooking the roux
5,very easy and taste great definitely a favorite
5,this soup was easy and delicious i took the advice of a couple of reviewers and made a roux of the onionbutter mixture before adding the broth there was no flour taste i used more onion than called for and also used baby bella mushroom hubby liked this soup and suggested a splash of sherry next time will definitely make again
5,excellent the only change we will make in the future is to chop the mushrooms smaller we also added about tbsp red wine while we sauteed the onions and mushrooms and it was outstanding
5,what a wonderful easy dishthanks for another tasty meal used coleslaw mix and left out the salt very tasty dish
5,very good like the reviews said you will need to add spices next time we are going to try this with some chicken
5,made a couple adjustmentsused basmati rice as dont have access to rice noodles and i also used pork sausage instead of ground pork used a bag of shredded cabbage rather than shredding it myself did garnish with green onions had a great flavor
5,these are so good healthy and easy it is impressive enough for company and comes together quickly so you can plate it for your hungry bellies
5,absolutely loved this dish
5,made with mushrooms and bell pepper no meat
5,delicious easy meal i used impossible meat instead of pork for my vegetarian husband i also added mushrooms and zucchini we served it with yum yum sauce and that really took it to next level
5,this was delicious as written then i tried it again tonight with some tweaks just because thats how i roll in the kitchen this time i chopped up a half pound of shrimp cooked a package of shrimpflavored ramen noodles and instead of putting together the spice mix used the seasoning packet from the ramen i was inspired by lillies idea then as suggested by another reviewer topped with yum yum sauce that i found on the recipe critics sitea href target_blank relnoopenera we absolutely inhaled it i plan to try this with ground chicken and chicken ramen next and also again as written but over rice instead of noodles excellent easy weeknight recipe that you can adjust as desired to keep things interesting thank you for sharing
5,i made it with milk amp only can of chicken broth still very good the flour thickens it up plenty
5,delicious and easy
5,this recipe is so very easy i have already in less than two weeks made it twice and also gave the recipe to my friends
5,what a fantastic recipe for those cold and blustery days i had a little left over homemade turkey broth from thanksgiving that needed to be used but not enough for the recipe so i added to it with my homemade chicken stock so easy and quick to make i enjoyed it for lunch today
5,i make this for me and my year old and we love it
5,this was wonderfulthanks for the recipe
5,mmmm so much better than canned soup and almost as easy i increased the mushrooms to pints and sauteed them until they released their liquid and it all evaporated i followed the rest of the recipe as written for a great flavor combination try serving them with tohs onion amp cheddar biscuits see recipe at
5,i love this recipe i use pounds of shredded chicken instead of cubed perfect for dipping tortilla chips in as well
5,this is a really good recipe i made it for the first time last night need a white chili recipe to take to a gathering i got a lot of compliments on it and several requests for the recipe i added minced garlic to it and additional chicken broth next time ill probably triple the recipe as written the yield is pretty small
5,made this for the first time last night read all the reviews first however followed the exact recipe results thinner than desired but quickly fixed that with the great suggestion of to tbls flour served with tortilla chips great flavor big hit with the husband will make again with rotisserie chicken and replace the whipping cream and sour cream with cream cheese unless a thinner chili is preferred use the flour as other reviews suggest
5,i found this recipe about a month ago and my boyfriend is obsessed he made me bring it to thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit hes having me make it again tonight for his birthday lol it really is the best chili ever
5,very good recipe you do need to add a couple of teaspoons of cornstarch to it in order to thicken it up i did omit the green chiles in order to control the heat they can be added when served if you like it to be more spicy good for me without the chiles i also love to eat regular chili served over rice i did the same with this and it was great
5,so good i doubled the recipe mine came out very thick because i blended the beans with the chicken broth then added the rest of the beans i may need to add a splash of water in each serving i could go a little hotter next time i got a large jalapeño so only put in one minced mine maybe next time used rotisserie chicken as a shortcut really delicious tho
5,this was just excellent i used half a pound of dry beans that i had cooked in my instant pot as well as shredded chicken from bonein thighs also cooked in the pressure cooker didnt want to use heavy cream so i just used a little milk and thickened with a couple of tablespoons of masa harina i also shaved off a few calories with fatfree sour cream still very creamy and delicious probably could have added another can of green chiles and may just do that next time i make a batch of this
5,very good i wonder if it once had cream cheese and taste of home changed the recipe i prefer it with navy beans that are smaller i also used canned chicken from costco because thats what i had i used fat free cream cheese along with the whipping cream and then i stirred the cheddar cheese in at the end
5,i didnt change a single thing love it
5,this was hands down the most delicious white chili i have ever had i did not add tortilla chips and only used can of the green chilis and it was perfect
5,delicious and easy to make i followed the recipe with only tiny tweeks i didnt have any cumin so i used a little chili powder instead i also used just a little garlic only because we are both sensitive to it but if you are not then go for it im sure it would add a lot i didnt have sharp cheddar so i used cheese mecican blend shredded worked fine but these were minor tweeks and im sure it is fabulous just as written too mine was plenty thick so i dont know why some people felt theirs was too thin i did set out the creams when i first started the dish so they wouldnt be so cold when ready to add them i stirred a couple teaspoon of the hot chili into each to warm them up before adding so they wouldnt curdle i will defimitely make this again thanks for sharing this delicious recipe
5,this was super good and so easy with the coleslaw my husband friends and i love egg rolls but i totally lack the skill to roll them i used lo mein noodles because thats what i had on hand and i added more soy sauce when i served it the only other addition i think i would make is add something crunchy on top like a fried egg roll wrapper great recipe will make again
5,this is one of my husbands favorite dishes and ive made this dish numerous times since we first tried it i use the shredded coleslaw that includes shredded carrots and add additional shredded carrot until it looks right i also add a little more ground ginger than called for as we like the additional flavor i now keep rice noodles on hand just for this recipe i also save some time by browning a full pound of ground pork ahead of time in the sesame oil separating it into two pound packages and freezing it just remember to label the package so as to not confuse it for browned ground beef this dish goes together so quickly with these short cut hacks and you have a delicious alternative to timeconsuming conventional egg rolls delicious flavor
5,i love chinese food but hate the fat and calories that come with it this satisfies the need for the flavors but is much healthier than eating an egg roll i will definitely be making this again vfe
5,this was so good i loved how easy it was to whip up on a weeknight nice flavor i will definitely make this one again
5,this was excellent and it was even better as leftovers two days later the cabbage didnt get wilty at all i used ground turkey because that was what i had and next time ill use fewer noodles it was so flavorful my cat walked around the table sniffing for tidbits and shes usually never interested in human food
5,this recipe is fantastic i opted for the meatless version and used scrambled eggs i also bumped up the spices a notchour preference hubby and i thought it was great and i cant wait to make it again
5,i really enjoyed this recipe i read the comments prior to making and i added more garlic and seasoning did not add extra salt or soy sauce and i thought it was quite delicious my meat and potatoes boyfriend really liked it too i think this recipe is a keeper and i look forward to making it again and trying different veggie combinations with it
5,excellent easy recipe my first time to use rice noodles amp they were delicious thank you for yet another recipe that is definitely a keeper the seasonings were sooo perfect
5,made without changes except adding some chopped sweet red pepper really nice for the summer quick and light
5,i cant wait to make this looks amazing excellent recipe
5,this was delicious i did add some red pepper flakes to spice it up will definitely make it again someone suggested doubling the sauce but i thought it was sufficient though i dont know how it will do as leftovers ie if the noodles will soak up the sauce and be somewhat dry the next day
5,this is tasty the recipe sounded good but i rarely eat pork a half pound of cooked shredded chicken was substituted for the pork and the serving was topped with some duck sauce serving was only points ww it is tasty and filling melaniem
5,egg roll without the roll loved it wouldnt change a thing but put a jar of colmans english mustard on the table because i didnt have any chinese hot mustard worked perfectly east meets west
5,great quick meal i used a bag of coleslaw mix and omitted the noodles i cut wontons into quarters and deep fried for about seconds in peanut oil and served on the side with sweet thai chili
5,we loved it quick and light meal i read previous reviews so i made sure to buy the chinese spice without reading the the ingredients in the jar i could have saved myself buying the spice and just added some cinnamon and more ginger i also just used almost a full oz bag of coleslaw mix to save time at my local store they had two different kinds of rice noodles a thin lo mein looking kind and a rounded thin crispy kindi used the crispy kind lachoy added some more crunch we enjoyed it
5,easy light delicious i did use cole slaw mix and it worked great
5,a really fast and easy meal to prep especially when using the suggested shortcuts my husband and i loved it definitely a keeper
5,really fast and easy meal ingredients are items that are usually readily available definitely a quick go to when hungry
5,my whole family loves this including my and year old they cant eat it fast enough i have made it many times and tried with tofu ground turkey scrambled eggs you name it so versatile
5,love this
5,we loved this my husband said it was a keeper i used one boneless chicken breast cut into tiny pieces and sprinkled just a pinch of red pepper flakes it was a tad dry when i added the noodles so increased the amount of soy sauce and a little chicken broth to loosen it up will definitely be making this often
5,fantastic i use red chili sesame oil to spice it up a bit other than that i follow the recipe just as its written and have never had it turn out less than phenomenal my husband likes to throw a few chow mein noodles on his for a bit more texturecrunch such a family favorite
5,really does taste like an egg roll if you miss the crunch you can always add some fried wonton strips to your bowl but the recipe is perfect and delicious as written super simple to make great for busy nights when you dont have lots of energy to cook or need to get the kids fed fast
5,we love this i make it using shredded coleslaw rather than chop up a head of cabbage we also use gluten free noodles and gluten free soy sauce so my year old granddaughter with diet restrictions can eat it i tried using the angel hair type rice noodles and prefer it with a firmer noodle i added two slightly beaten eggs to the cooked pork and cabbage for a reason years ago i made egg rolls for asian friends and they told me i forgot to add the egg adding the egg does not alter the taste of the egg roll noodle bowl ingredients
5,very good needed more flavor but that wasnt hard to augment
5,we have an international student from china living with us and he loves this recipe we love the seasoning and the cabbage is delicious i use precooked pad thai noodles
5,i made this today and it was delicious i used less ginger because i am not a fan of an overpowering ginger taste i also used a tenderized pork cutlet and pounded it more at home and chopped it up the texture was great and it was lower in fat than the ground pork adding a touch of soy sauce to the completed dish made it taste like an egg roll dipped in sauce i made a half recipe for lunch in my nordic ware mini wok and it was perfect my daughter loved it too and we will be making this again
5,my husband loved this he asked me to make again next week i did add a little chinese spice to it for a little kick
5,i make this frequently double the first ingredients use precut broccoli slaw for cabbage use whatever onion on hand and linguine pasta for rice noodles dh preference very flavorful and leftovers reheat nicely
5,excellent i made this with eggs scrambled instead of the pork and a little duck sauce fantastic my family and friends loved it
5,everyone loved it i did double the first four ingredients as another person suggestedi was told to make it again it is a keeper
5,oh my gosh so good i substituted canelli beans because i like them better i added just one can of green chiles and no heavy whipping cream or no substitute for it like others suggested for thicker chililike texture i added one tablespoon of flour to chicken
5,this is a very good recipe if needed its easy to change it i had to make some changes i cannot have beans so i didnt put them in i didnt have green chili so i added a can of tomatoes with green chillies it came out great i love recipes that can be changed to fit the person will be making this again
5,this is a very easy recipe that delivers excellent results could not get over how good it was will make again
5,very tasty and quite simple to make
5,i make this every year for thanksgiving i substitute turkey and turkey broth instead of chicken everyone loves it if i miss a year making it the family is complaining and wanting it
5,this is the best white chicken chili i have ever tasted everyone loved it and i am asked to make it all the time i am confused however by the little note at the beginning of the recipe which reads maybe its the cream cheese am i missing something i dont see cream cheese in the ingredients list anywhere sounds like it would be good though i highly recommend this chili
5,for those asking about the cream cheese they changed the recipe online it used to have cream cheese in place of the sour cream ive made this recipe for years i always look it up before i buy the ingredients to make sure i dont miss anything i search by white chicken chili cream cheese to make sure i pull up this recipe i was surprised to see sour cream now especially because they specifically mention cream cheese in the description i will continue to make it with the cream cheese because this is a family favorite and i dont want to change whats not broken i make this close to the post recipe but i do slow cook it on the stove with boneless skinless chicken breast and i also add cilantro when i mix in the cream and cream cheese my picky boys love it
5,weve made this several times through the years and it never disappoints also recipe doubles well
5,i have made this for several years it is definitely a favorite in this house ill need to double it in the future
5,so easy and flavorful will be a new regular recipe in my house
5,family favorite for many years ive share this recipe with family
5,made this just as the recipie called for and it was delicious hubby loves it as well will be making it again soon
5,my absolute favorite chili recipe its so easy and delicious i added half a can of corn and a little hot sauce to the recipe and its amazing
5,this is the best white chili ive ever had it is a hit with this family old and young i always think i might have some for a few days but it never lasts that long he never gets tired of it and neither do i
5,so easy and quick to make and very good tasting i used prepackaged coleslaw mix to save time this recipe is a definite keeper and all my family even my picky eaters have requested me to make it again
5,so pleasantly surprised by this recipe it was better than i expected i initially thought the ingredients did not allow for enough sauce but it is so flavorful and it was indeed enough i did however deglaze the pan after cooking the pork with about cup of chicken stock because the spices got concentrated on the bottom of the pan that didnt create more sauce because it evaporated just wanted to get the good bits off the bottom of the pan but that i used leftover pork roast cubed up instead of ground pork i also used more liquid aminos instead of the soy sauce and added another tablespoon it needed more of that ingredient in my mind next time i make it i will probably use oz of the noodles instead of just personal preference i would like more cabbage ratio than noodle i did add one egg towards the end and scrambled it in the pan didnt need it necessarily but i liked the added richness it provided i added some chopped cilantro on top as i served it this is a keeper and for me thats a big deal i rarely go by recipes but i followed this one to the t and it was great
5,my husband and i love this recipe i add some sugar peas and bamboo shoots serve it up on a bed of rice and pour some home made edo japan terriakyi sauce on top awesome meal and if there are any leftovers theyre also great the next day
5,both my husband and i thought it had plenty of flavor but it wasnt overpowering like one of the other reviewers mentioned this recipe is just for the inside of an egg roll if you normally dip your egg roll in soy sauce youll want to add extra soy sauce to this i used finely shredded cabbage that came in a bag and put several baby carrots in a food processor for the shredded carrots i did the full amount for everything but only did c finely shredded cabbage and c processed carrots this was because when i was putting them into the pan these amounts alone looked like a lot i couldnt imagine adding more i also did regular yellow onion not green i thought the ratio of veggiesmeatnoodles seemed pretty good too overall my husband and i loved this and we cant wait to try it again
5,this was great so yummy kids liked it too which is always a plus this recipe easy to make i did you use extra soy sauce in mine this recipe is weight watchers smart points
5,i have made this but i added actual egg rolls that i deep fried and cut up into four pieces to it sooooo good
5,this is a great recipe and so quick to make i did sub chicken for the pork as some others had suggested i added mushrooms also i will definitely be making this again
5,very good flavor i didnt put in the turmericmainly because i dont think turmeric does anything but change a dish a very odd color
5,made this for dinner tonight and my husband devoured all of it i served it with hot mustard and hoisin sauce on the side it was simple and quick to make especially since i used fresh coleslaw mix which saved me the task of shredding cabbage and carrots great recipe a keeper thanks for sharing it courtney
5,i ground my own pork to make this dish and it was worth it very tasty
5,we love this recipe ive made it a couple times nowthe second time i cheated and used coleslaw mix it worked great
5,we really enjoyed this dish it has great flavor and is quick and easy to make thanks for sharing
5,so easy delicious and lower in fat than fried egg rolls too i cut up some cooked salad shrimp and tossed them in as well great recipe
5,genius i too dont want the trouble of making them besides i want to know what im eating
5,made this for our family dinner the three of us gave it as a keeper i did substitute coleslaw mix for the cabbage and the two large carrots were a bit too much will cut those back a bit this goes in our file of keepers i am on a somewhat restricted diet following heart surgery left out the salt and used low sodium soy sauce cargram my mom used the sweet amp sour sauce she was very pleased with all but she did request fried wonton wrappers next time
5,made this last night to bring for lunch today it was awesome i used cole slaw mix and will be using that from now on turned out just perfect
5,quick easy healthy and delicious
5,so simple and delicious i substituted leftover panfried tofu and one lightly scrambled egg in place of the ground pork used prepackaged coleslaw mix and about cups of shredded carrot and then topped off the finished produce with a sprinkling of peanuts and sriracha sauce i love someones idea of using spicy mustard andor sweet and sour sauce in the future will definitely be making this again
5,so quick and easy and full of veggies you could probably add peas too i couldnt find ground pork so used ground turkey and it worked well even my superpicky three yearold loved this
5,loved this hearty onebowl veggiepacked dish made a wonderful weeknight supper for my husband and me we both enjoyed it and will definitely be making it again i doubled the recipe and i have to admit that my big ol hubby and i ate the whole thing
5,i loved this incredibly easy and the flavors are incredible i love egg rolls and this was a great way to get the flavor without making them myself i did not use the sesame oil but coconut instead and found a coleslaw mix at the store with preshredded cabbage and carrots otherwise i followed the recipe exactly my bag of rice noodles had the option to fry or boil the noodles so i assumed that boiling was the option preferred foe the recipe will be making it again
5,this is truly a simple and delicious recipe its definitely a keeper i added one ingredienthot chili pepper because we are big fans of heat
5,a very simple and delicious recipe make this recipe once and you will never forget how quick and easy it is from pan to the table in no time at all i cut a few corners by using store bought coleslaw it worked just fine i also had no rice noodles so i broke up a handful of thin spaghetti that also worked just fine winner indeedjanietaste of home volunteer food editor
5,awesome if you are looking for a fast recipe that is also light and quick this is it i made as written family requested to make again
5,excellent this reminded my husband of his favorite dish at a fast food noodle restaurant i liked it because i could control the ingredients and the cost per serving was a fraction of the restaurant price the only changes i made were to add a bit more soy sauce to suit our tastes and to use sliced boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of ground pork i think you could use any protein and get a great result this has been declared a top favorite meal in our house
5,loved it had to use fettuccini rather than rice noodles its a keeper
5,both my husband amp i loved this i had ramen rice noodles so i used those i also substituted fresh grated ginger instead of ground ginger my husband added hoisin sauce to his dish while i added a few additional shakes of soya sauce this will now be in our regular rotation thanks courtney
5,love it the recipe is perfect the way it is the hardest part for me is finding ground pork that isnt frozen if i dont plan far enough ahead the leftovers are just as good as well and ive eaten it cold as well
5,although this is a really good recipe i was taken aback at the title i was expecting actual egg noodles not rice noodles i love them both so i will try each of them egg noodles have so much flavor and i think they would be the perfect addition i have been cooking for many many years and i can honestly say this recipe is a keeper
5,i didnt have rice noodles so i used a package of ramen noodles without the seasoning packet and no green onions my husband suggested adding some broth and making it a soup but the rest of us didnt think that was necessary we all really enjoyed it
5,this sounds very close to the recipe i created for my fried egg rolls making a bowl of noodles is a great idea it is time consuming to roll and fry i have also rolled and then baked egg rolls they are very good and of course no oily mess spray them with cooking spray or even paint a thin layer of oil on all sides bake at degrees until lightly browned i gave a five star rating even though i havent used this recipe since it does sound so close to mine which is delicious of course
5,this is a keeper in my house i used chicken and changed the noodles to chinese flour noodles this was a great dish
5,always looking for gluten free recipes hubby has celiac this is so quick and easy very simple to adjust as you like doubled the recipe glad i did thanks so much
5,i made this for my grandson he posted it on fb i used whipped cream frosting topped with strawberries and wafer cookies now everyone is requesting one they love it
5,this was a delicious cake it was like a breath of spring the frosting was scrumptious even my husband who doesnt like frosting commented how yummy it was
5,i cant wait to make this for easter it looks ahhmazing
5,this is one of our favorite cakes to make perfect strawberry cake
5,best strawberry cake ever
5,this was excellent super moist and so flavorful and so easy i doubled and made a x and six large cupcakes for a grooms cake i iced the cupcakes with buttercream icing and did a white chocolate fondant on the cake outstanding i will definitly make it again thank you for sharing
5,i made this in cupcake form when someone at work requested strawberry cupcakes they were an absolute hit super moist i was even told they were better than my coworkers mothers strawberry cake
5,i bake this cake every year for my daughters birthday for several years shes old im not and its always perfect and delicious my recipe from southern living uses pans and the batter is just the right amount for pans
5,best strawberry cake around i have made it into cupcakes and into a couple loaf cakes and they come out beautiful and delicious every time
5,this is our favorite strawberry cake recipe thanks for sharing the frosting was a bit sweeter than we like so this time i made a whipped strawberry cream cheese frosting whipped a cup of heavy cream in a cold mixing bowl in a separate bowl i beat cup of unsalted butter with oz of cream cheese stirred in cup of pureed strawberries and tsp of vanilla then mixed in cups powdered sugar last step was folding the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture
5,i made this recipe today and used mindy cream cheese frosting my wife said the cake was good the frosting was good together they were wonderful
5,my family loves this cake i have already made it times thanks for sharing
5,pi have made this twice the first time with ground pork and the second time with ground chicken both times it was great i am even thinking about doing chopped up shrimp makes great leftovers i might try taking some sliced and baked won ton wrappers to add to the top for some crunch i sent leftovers with my husband with some chinese mustard for his lunch and he loved itp
5,great recipe and great flavor thanks
5,this recipe is amazing ive been making it for years ignore the rude and ignorant comments from those who have yet to actually make it if you want spicy feel free to add as much or as little of the cayenne pepper or jalapeños with or without seeds to your liking thats the beauty of cooking at home one tip i will give if you want an extra creamy texture add the creams in right away and let simmer until reduced
5,very delicious and easy to make
5,this recipe is awesome made it iver times now a big hit with the family
5,we have been making this for years now and its hands down our favorite chili recipe one thing i love about it is that you can substitute low fat versions of the creamsour cream and its still just as good ive even used skim milk in place of the whipping cream with no problems we always serve it with the zucchini amp cheese drop biscuits to die for
5,i made this for movie night with a few friends it got rave reviews and i thought it was yummy on advice of previous reviews i used cream cheese instead of sour cream i also popped a whole jalapeno in for the cooking process and fished it out and discarded when cooking was complete made it a day ahead of time the one person in the group who doesnt like heat said it was just right this is definitely going into my file of favorites
5,i changed this a little i added carrots potatoes and substituted coconut cream for the cream i also left out the cumin the creamy mix of the sour cream and cream made this soup delicious
5,delicious first time ever making a white chili and this one delivered in every way fantastic as is didnt change a thing will be a favorite keeper for me thanks for sharing
5,i made this last night for dinner it went together very fast and based on another reviewer i added ounces of cream cheese instead of the sour cream i accidently added too much cayenne so i did offer sour cream at the table along with shredded cheese personally i am not much of a fan of beans of any kind but this chili was good the only problem was it did not make enough for the hearty appetites for all the people at the table next time i make this i will double the recipe but this is a keeper even by my standards
5,i doubled the recipe i also substituted the sour cream with cream cheese added corn and bell peppers topped with sour cream cilantro shredded cheddar and fritos i am sooo very satisfied
5,this is my alltime favorite white chili recipe i make it as is except i will add a can of hominy and occasionally substitute pork for the chicken great with a spoonful of pico as well so good
5,we love this recipe and fix it often i even make it to take to people when they need a meal a couple of things i use unsalted chicken stock the oz box instead of the broth and instead of the sour cream and heavy cream i use a oz container of gandys french onion or green chili dip it just adds a little depth in flavor that we enjoy
5,the best while iit is hot it is not a long lasting hoe
5,delicious i added a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis and it turned out great
5,been making this for my family for a couple decades now and its always gotten rave reviews i do add real garlic along with the chicken garlic powder and onion to sauté before adding the rest of the ingredients in the past ive substituted evaporated skim milk for the heavy cream and it turns out well that way too i cut back on the cayenne for my own reasons but my daughter loved it full strength probably going to be making this recipe for another couple decades as well
5,the best strawberry cake i have had its so easy to prepare and super moist
5,by far the best strawberry cake i have ever had
5,this is a very good recipe it looks and tastes delicious it is a great recipe for a spring or summer gathering or company meal

5,this is the exact same recipe that my mil used to make strawberry cakes back in the s it was my late husbands favorite cake it is very easy to make and is absolutely delicious
5,my family loved it i added a small amount of crushed dried strawberries to both the cake and frosting to boost the flavor family loved it
5,delicious cake could i bake this in a bundt cakepan
5,this recipe came on boxes of betty crocker cake mixes back in the s and is one of my favorites my mamaw made it throughout the year using her stockpile of frozen strawberries from her summer crops her recipe just followed the directions on the box of strawberry cake mix then adding the strawberry gelation and strawberries
5,i just made this and it is very good unfortunately i did not have small pans so i made it in a bunt cake pan and i failed it was so moist it fell apart im not a baker so im sure i did something wrong so we had a deconstructed cake for mothers day lol tastes amazing the butter cream was the best ever
5,first time i made this i had similar problems as others have had made it in round cake pansi had a hard time getting it baked all the way had to keep adding extra time the icing was not as thick as i wouldve liked but didnt want to make it too sweet by adding more powdered sugar this time i baked in pans and bake time was min at degrees used the recommended oz of cream cheese and drained the pureed strawberries for icingperfection either was the cake is absolutely delicious kept in the refrigerator as a cool dessert with this hot summer heat this is will definitely be in my recipe book for life
5,absolutely delicious and definitely nostalgic i made this last night and it came out perfect i followed the recipe exactly without any issues i used two round nonstick pans its a pretty cake as well as tasty its a recipe my mother ri p made and was requested often at family gatherings i thought of her with many fond memories while making it looks like ill be carrying on the tradition now

5,i love strawberries this cake was moist and tasty i put chocolate dipped strawberries all over it it was beautiful so the icing wasnt runny i did make sure my butter was just softened not melted i crushed the strawberries and drained all the juice i could off of them i used cups of powdered sugar it was thin but not running i think next time i will add softened cream cheese for a little more stability i baked the cake about minutes it was moist and perfect
5,this is so good i love the strawberry flavor and it makes a very pretty cake
5,i really liked this recipe i brought for a church potluck and there were no leftovers i decorated the top with candy hearts i loved the fresh berries in the frosting and cake really added something special i did not think too sweet i made frosting as listed and softened not melted butter and the texture was great i did put in frig after making until i served maybe that was the trick will make again

5,this is an amazing cake and so easy to put together
5,excellent cake so moist and flavorful its hard to just stop at one piece after reading several of the reviews i added two ounces of cream cheese to the frosting and let the strawberries for the frosting sit in a strainer while the cake was baking with making those small changes it turned out beautiful and absolutely delicious it is now in my permanent cake recipe file
5,oh my gosh this is the best strawberry cake ever i added ounces of cream cheese to the frostinguhheavenly stars
5,this cake was delicious i made a sheet cake instead of a layer cake so it took a good minutes or so longer to cook the cake was still super moist i also drained the crushed strawberries before adding them to the icing and added ounces of cream cheese as some suggested perfection i will definitely be making this one again
5,what a wonderful cake easy to make and just delicious the addition of fresh strawberries in the batter added so much fresh flavor and the strawberry buttercream frosting is just wonderful this cake is moist delicious and packed with strawberry goodness its a perfect warm weather dessert when strawberries are at their peak and something i will definitely make again and again

5,i made this last weekend i used strawberry cake mix instead of white crushed strawberries i used in cool whip in place of the frosting and put in the fridge delicious
5,best strawberry cake ever i made this as a birthday cake with an additional lemon cake layer per the request of my yearold daughter moist homemade flavor even though its from a box and has flavored gelatin i was skeptical but now throughly impressed it was a real hit i use a good avocado oil for baking instead of canola or veg oil i used a food chopper to chop strawberries they were perfect not too fine and not too big i used the frosting recipe ingredients only but with different measurements plus added cream cheese to it and made it as a filling between the layers not nearly as sweet that way as others had mentioned and frosted with white icing i tripled this recipe and baked it in a x x pan only used about of the recipes instead of the full tripled amount to fill the pan it came out perfect i used nonstick spray on pan as well as the parchment paper and sprayed paper do not let cake cool completely in pan only cool cake about min on a cooling rack took a knife and wen along the edges of the pan to release any possibly stuck sides i noticed that the gelatin with the sugar may stick a little bit but its not bad then placed another piece of parchment paper on the top of the cake placed cooling rack on top of the cake and while holding both cooling rack and pan flipped cake over and let it sit for a moment shook gently removed pan nothing stuck just a thought but usually cant go wrong when a cake recipe begins with mamaw
5,when i made this recipe two months ago i put cream cheese icing on it and decorated the top with sliced strawberries to look like a rose my family loves it and have now asked me to make a total of five times
5,super strawberry cake will make it over and over this summer i just made couple of changes used tbsp self rising flour instead of of all purpose gives the cake a homemade taste and skipped the spoons of sugar added oz cream cheese and cup whipping cream to the icing it was absolutely delicious thank you
5,jennifer afraid youll have to tell your husband this was my mawmaw benies strawberry cake before it was his mawmaw emilys it could probably be called a lotta different mawmaws strawberry cake hahaha it is a wonderful cake my grandmother made many times she always topped and decorated it with beautiful whole strawberries by the way
5,great recipe quick used strawberriy flavored cake mix and skipped the jello beautiful pink color made mini cupcakes baked in mini cupcake liners at degrees for minutes minis cupcakes great with frosting or alone as volunteer feild editor with taste of home magazine i love recipes utilizing pantry goods with fresh seasonal fruits
5,i want to try this but i would like to know if anyone has used sugar free jello and splenda to cut down on the sugar and how it turned out i am diabetic
5,ive been making this cake for years and is a family favorite yes the frosting can get a little messy i usually have to cut back a little on the juice from the strawberries or add more powdered sugar i also store it in the refrigerator so the frosting stays firmer

5,i almost cried when i made this for easter and took the first bite as it was just like my mother grandmother and aunt all made for me as a child it is a delicious moist very strawberry cake truly if you like strawberries you will like this my only change was i used cup oil and cup water instead of as stated also it took me cups of x sugar
5,i made this for easter lunch and it was a huge hit my brother thought it was a recipe that belonged to our mother
5,a deliciously fabulous cake a real family favorite made it for my own tiered wedding cake and every last bite was gone
5,i started making this years ago it was called strawberry jello cake used no sugar or flour just cake mix strawberry jello eggs oil water and oz bag of frozen strawberries separate strawberries from juice save juice for glaze baked in x pan for glaze oz bag powdered sugar little melted butter and strawberry juice mix and pour over cooled cake take a fork and poke cake all over before pouring glaze
5,sounds delicious
5,thank you for sharing jennifer it is a keeper
5,i made this for a baby shower but as cupcakes not a tiered cake baked them at for about min also i used a whipped cream icing instead of a buttercream the same recipe as the snow globe cake here on taste of home with about tsp added strawberry flavour and they tasted like strawberries and cream got tons of rave reviews from everybody at the shower
5,wonderful recipe i made a and baked it about minutes the only change i made was to the frosting i used mashed strawberries in a heavy syrup instead of crushed fresh strawberries i wanted more strawberry flavor and this was perfect creamed the butter and a tablespoon of the strawberries then beat in powdered sugar added small amounts of strawberries until i got the right consistency desired served the cake with a really good vanilla ice cream and dribbled a little of the remaining strawberry syrup concoction over the top people made themselves miserable with second servings
5,h my gosh this is one of the best cakes ive made very tasty and moist i didnt make the frosting but next time i will this will go with my favorite recipes
5,i didnt see cream cheese in the recipe but it was in the description so i added it toward the end i added a little adobo seasoning and used my own dried cayenne also added diced tomatoes with green chilis otherwise made the recipe as written it was fabulous a forever keeper thank you
5,this is one of the few recipes i use where i dont change the ingredients love it
5,this was excellent i only had can of chilis so i opened a can of jalapenos and added a teaspoon i threw it all in the ninja foodie and put it under pressure for mins with quick release then i added the sour cream and whipping cream i served with crisp tortillas and shredded cheese it was loved by all even my granddaughter i will be making this again oh i didnt have great northern beans so i used two cans of white beans turned out perfect
5,this is the best chili recipe i have gotten blue ribbons making it for company cook offs last year mad it for a halloween party and it got rave reviews this year the party was banned but we had it anyway and the local police officer came to the party in the uniform and said i wont say anything if i get some of that chili you made last year lol
5,ive made this chili for several years and follow the recipe as written i use chicken tenderloins and heavy cream and sour cream if its not broken dont fix it its the perfect comfort food on a cold day the tortilla chips go perfectly and a grilled cheese on the side doesnt hurt either especially if made with home made pimento cheese
5,outstanding just the way it is
5,this was absolutely delicious it was my first time making chili and i loved it it turned out a lot more soupy than i expected and i even mashed up a cup of the beans like the recipe said i think next time i make this i wont add the cream to see f that makes thicker but is super yummy even if it is more of a soupstew yummm
5,i dont change a thing in this recipe itsperfect as directed i found it in my taste of home cookbook years ago and have been making it ever since i dont even look for other recipes because why mess with perfection i was just diagnosed with gluten intolerance and thankfully this recipe is my exhusband would not eat chicken so my son made it with pork also delicious he still used chicken stock but the ex didnt know that
5,excellent recipe this will be on regular rotation
5,i make this for my soninlaw for when he has to work cold winter nights in michigan he loves it instead of green chiles i changed to hatch green chiles to give it a little kick you can use as much or as little depending on how you like it
5,wonderful recipe as written only change i made was i used rotisserie chicken because i always have it on hand in my freezer as a time saver even my husband who said chili cant be white said to make sure to keep this recipe thanks laura for making him a believer
5,wow total wow totally delicious stars plus
5,very good easy recipe first time followed exactly but i added flour to chicken and onion mixture to help thicken and did not add cream cheese made a second time with no mild chilies and only a few shakes of cayenne and it was still good liked it less spicy but will make again other in family liked it too
5,this is our goto chicken chili recipe and has been for years we love it and its so simple
5,delicious a huge hit with family and friends several requests to make again and share recipe thank you
5,this is a hit in my house i have been making it for a few years now i typically double the recipe as written adding only a can or two of sweet corn we always eat this with jiffy cornbread absolutely a favorite
5,omg you must make this cake i made it for my strawberrycrazy daughterinlaw and it has supplanted her previous favorite i am not too fond of strawberries but this is going on my favorites list i need to think about the frosting think ill use the recipe frosting between the layers and then use a thinner version more as a glaze it sure makes a generous portion also this cake is better the next day or at least wellchilled try it and youll be happy
5,i tweaked it a little removed onions because of onion haters in my house used italian seasoning instead of just oregano and use a paprika cayenne mix and a little more than the recipe called for we like everything a bit more hot the chili was amazing it was easy to make and everyone absolutely loved it it will now be a staple meal in our house
