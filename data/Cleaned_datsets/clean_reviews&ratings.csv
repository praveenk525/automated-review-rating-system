1,cute but not addictive
1,beautiful promises very pretty but returned twice and always defective after a few days she stops constantly damage
1,the otter works only seconds and stops i think to return the product
1,month after using the otter breathing already doesnt work and my daughter doesnt sleep without this function lost
1,received product already broken at onoff
1,to change the way you have to disassemble it take off etc with what it entails that the girl wakes up
1,its sad that it doesnt work
1,the week i buy it its been damaged its not going to music
1,already the nd attempt unfortunately both otters have a wobble contact or somewhere the electronics spins if you move the otter it just goes out or he just stops the work without any action before the actual minutes so for our l√ºtte a pure fall although the idea is great too bad
1,i ordered this article for my baby it was born on january and it doesnt work anymore the otters breathing mechanism blocks and stops music and light we have to open the rear scratch and press the music behind so that it can work without breathing what a pity yet the idea is nice the otter is cute and the sounds are pleasant
1,hello i dont understand the waste my son has a problem she shuts down alone after a few seconds
1,actually a nice idea the functions are very nice and reassuring our daughter months found him greatnow the big hook comes he does not work any more after a short time always goes off on his own and can then no longer be switched onhe was returned and ordered elsewhere but also the second one there was the same problem also this was returned and we dont want any more battery change supplied batteries are probably only intended for demo purposes in the shop helped nothing at all
1,our daughter adopted it right away and the otter served as a transitional object to succeed in falling asleep alone however it no longer works after a month we will exchange it but in view of the comments with a star it seems rather recurring and it is a shame
1,does not work more than seconds very disappointed
1,very disappointed at the start great i bought one and we offered another one for my binoculars they love except that the mechanism no longer works after a month and the two i cant send it back because its too late purchased in advance and i cant find the contact of the manufacturer
1,shipping as well as well top but was very disappointed when i tried the alone in demo mode only sec music with rushing hacking the movement of the belly and the loud mechanic sounds that rob a nerves rather than relax and calm down with a long buzzing at the end went backno recommendation to buy
1,purchased the it already doesnt work despite battery changes it is now impossible to have breath and music at the same time
1,very disappointed the article no longer works after month of usedamage because the music was relaxing vrm for baby
1,the engine of the breathing movement just way too loudthat cant be right could a defective model be sent also that the slumber otter was only packed in a bag without a carton seemed to me unscrupulous
1,actually disappointed as kept this as a gift for my new baby boy for months and got out the box and doesnt stay on nearly long enough cant return either as window has passed which pretty unfair really only weeks as was keeping the item to the side for a gift for when he was born and just really disappointed
1,i was not able to test the white noises and the breathing modewhatever happens the plush is too hard on the belly which is normal since it houses the whole sound systemim glad to see what it was like to see the praises i had but glad to have returned it too
1,very disappointed with this product immediately delivered first bad surprise the product was not new then when starting it it stops after or seconds and the sounds are accompanied by a fairly pronounced mechanical noise
1,only works for seconds at a time terrible
1,the toy stopped working after week we even bought batteries in case or but the toy just doesnt want to walk anymore
1,first delivery breath movements dont work second delivery engine is so loud i dont want to do that to my childunfortunately i was really looking forward to it
1,soon there will be no electricity
1,the volume is so low even on the loudest setting even if you hold it to your ear you cant listen the breathing heartbeat sounds it was a gift to someone and unfortunately i cant return it now waste of money its used just as a soft toy now could have just bought a soft toy and would have cost much less
1,the otter is at first glance very sweet but the electronic part is totally thick and noticeable so that the otter is hardly suitable for cuddles besides after weeks the electronics broke directly with us nothing could be played off a cheekyness for such a nameable manufacturer because this happened not only with this otter but even with the reordering
1,the otter is composed of the clothing that is of poor quality the body inside is very large very heavy the sounds and lights are mediocre
1,cant get the other to play sounds for more than a few seconds nothing in the instruction manual addresses this so i dont know if ours is faulty or what really quite upset and disappointed
1,idea worthless gift i do not recommend unfortunately the noise of this nightlight is not at all pleasant the plush is pretty but it stops the
1,i offered it to my sister and it does not work and impossible to exchange it super super disappointed
1,very disappointed i loved this little otter everything was pleasant until its disfunction after a week the breathing mechanism stopped after a few seconds after a quick exchange the second otter was even more malfunctioning i had to ask for a refund this product is not to the point despite the good idea too bad my monthold son loved him
1,after a few weeks unfortunately no longer functioning music function
1,after months amazon sends me a new one
1,after months broken belly does not enter and the melody is now funny
1,so i was very disappointed looked so great on ddn pictures but when it arrived it looked very cheap and also made a lot of noise with the individual functions so i wouldnt recommend it anymore but should everyone try it themselves
1,not happy about quality
1,i received the otter as a replacement order because the first one on the electronic part was a bit defective now i get this one here which works normally but the quality of the fabric is not the same the otter has only a painted face while the other one was embroidered with the nose whiskers and the mouth which is of course qualitatively inferior with the replacement now i will probably have to send it in again and hope to get a reasonable replacement until the birth of my child at the price one should expect that
1,this thing is very nice but its too heavy for a baby when it falls on the body
1,great gift my grandson is satisfied and sleeps well with it
1,no matter how many times i change the battery it runs out of charge within minutes
1,the otter is much too loud with its mechanical noises and now after a little more than month the drive from the belly is defective it no longer drives out or enters
1,terrible waste of money it is huge for a child it is super hard in the middle and not cuddly at all
1,after a few days already defective
1,teur ive already thrown itthe quality is not good
1,purchased in may and broken in september
1,unfortunately it wasnt accepted at allthe engine is also quite noisyunfortunately i cant recommend it at all but every baby is different
1,unfortunately the otter was defective and did not work or always only for a few seconds as with a wobble contact
1,the product is after times used capput no sound left
1,that keeps hanging and then you can use the nixht morefor what it costs it is not good
1,product already bought twice both times broken after only a short time songs are played only briefly
1,unfortunately after x use defectivevery nice otter but unfortunately we caught a mondayotter which after a short time does not work properlya lot of money for it a pity
1,i am very unhappy with this product which is surprising since i am a huge fisherprice fan i think i must have received a defective item because the breathing and movement options only stay on for about seconds i have tried replacing batteries but that did not help the music stays on longterm but i got it for the breathing and sounds i would return the item however my husband disposed of all packaging materials before i had a chance to use it extremely disappointed and a waste of
1,unfortunately after a few times use the button is broken and music after a few seconds also goes outunfortunately for the price also totally badreturn was done without problemsthank you
1,i bought the slumber otter in march and it doesnt work properly anymore it stops after seconds
1,only lasts months then the mechanism broke in the belly and it also no longer played music one expects more for the money especially a longer possibility of use
1,the video promises more than original totally disappointed
1,product didnt work couldnt turn off the demo button and the instructions dont mention the demo button
1,already broken after months and seller not contactable
1,unfortunately after seconds the music breaks off every time takes weeks after the end of the return period very bad therefore not to use and a star
1,worst damn thing i ever ordered it only worked for couple days then stopped altogether i changed the batterys an still no difference the part that goes in an out stopped working completely
1,its very sweet maybe but too quiet so it doesnt bring anything for it too expensive and was now a waste of money for us
1,a great gift for babies our month old daughter is happy when he is at her side even our year old sleeps with it a
1,like many other reviews the item shuts itself off almost immediately each time after using only a few times
1,didnt work properly so much money for nothing good
1,unfortunately the otter is broken after one month matching days after the return period expired for the money it is more than disappointing
1,this thing was such a disappointment it turns off after about a second of playing it worked well a couple times in the beginning so i was hopeful it was just a glitch because i didnt change the batterys from when it was in its packaging but no it makes no difference waste of money
1,this stopped working after a year dont bother contacting the manufacturer they suggested that i purchase a new one without trying to accommodate
1,i am so disappointed in this i had it on my registry and loved how cute it looked the sound functions are ok but the breathing motion is not as expected it makes a loud clicking noise and is not snuggly at all it wakes baby up and is not something they can cuddle with
1,at first we were satisfied with the music clock but we only used it to play the music unfortunately it doesnt work anymore after only months and goes out after a short time we would have promised ourselves a better quality from a wellknown manufacturer too bad
1,after only months the mechanism that mimics the breath has brokensin was a good product but given the duration and the price i do not recommend it
1,dont work anymore im disgusted we hear more the sound of the engine than the heartbeat
1,our slumber otter is already broken after weeks of use otherwise i find it really great
2,two months and its already broken my kid barley used it and it still broke after less than two months
2,unfortunately i didnt see that you have to pay the return shipment yourself the package had exactly the size that it can only be sent expensivelywe disturbed the following the breathing movements we find rather creepy and totally unnatural cant imagine that a child no infant our child is already months old does not find that strangethe volume at the lowest level was still too loud for us if you imagine listening to the music in a totally quiet dark room i would find the music too present and no background musicunfortunately you cant take the animal out and look at it rationally then you would irrevocably destroy the packaging
2,ordered for my monthold son who struggles to sleepvery disappointed in order to be able to make the adjustments volume light movements of the belly you have to undo a scratch in the back if baby is sleeping next door he will necessarily be awakened moreover the mechanism of the movements of the belly makes a lot of noise compared to the volume of the lowest musicthe melodies are nice and soothing but really not practical and poorly thought
2,my baby does not like it maybe when she gets older
2,the otter looks cute but is infinitely loud from the motorin addition i find it totally awkward to open the velcro down every time you want to make a different setting song volume light
2,i bought it for my grandson he was months old and not interested at all to play he is too boring and not interesting to fall asleep either too bad he is ignored to this day
2,its super cute and this would be great but the motor makes this loud squeaking sound and has the very first time i turned it on changed the batteries and that didnt work for the amount of money it was im pretty disappointed
2,unfortunately we didnt like napkins my son was rather irritated by him than calmed down
2,i find it a very sweet idea you music is great that light is pleasant also the heart tones etc very soothing however as soon as you turn on the breathing it is going up and down the belly sooo loud that sleep is not really to be thought of
2,honestly i returned this the reviews were great but for bucks this is like any other toy that makes sounds to my baby it didnt phase him and like what other reviewers said if you lightly touch the stomach it stops playing music and stuff so it just sat next to him eh
2,totally great not too bright simply super every now and then it cracks a little but totally sweet was the gift for christmas for our baby
2,the little otter is a soothing cuddly sleep aid for our little granddaughter
2,i was recommended to buy this by a family member who had purchased it for her kids prior to purchasing i did read some concerning reviews and was a little skeptical as its pretty pricey but wanted to give it a chance the toy is extremely soft and easy to set up to use the functions allow you to choose music a light which you can dim or brighten and breathing function we used this combo for my yr old and she would fall asleep watching it less than a month later sadly i have to return it as the belly doesnt move up and down for more than seconds its also cuts off the music and light before i even leave her room pressing the belly back in i can hear a loud clicking sound that wasnt there when initially turning it on i hope this isnt a ongoing issue as im unsure if i want to order another one
2,i bought this product months ago for when my son was born the otter is very cute and i was excited to use it however i just started using it and it turns on and shuts off after seconds and gets stuck in the up position and wont go back down and the music turns off i really wanted to love this product it is so cute and soft but not worth the money i returned the product
2,i only put stars because of the sound of the mechanism which is very unpleasant
2,in itself the toy is very good however after a month it started to spin sometimes it goes out after seconds sometimes the sounds change by themselvesging back too bad
2,the sound machine and the breathing of the otter was great and would help my son fall asleep it worked for about a week and then when you pushed the button it would make a noise for a couple seconds then stop agree with other reviews that sometimes the breathing mode would make a loud sound but it wasnt consistent unfortunately it seems this toy is not reliable in performing as described so hard to recommend this to anyone especially at its price point
2,if you want to change the setting you have to open a velcro closure at the back however this is so loud that not only your own baby but probably still wakes up the neighbors baby
2,too big and not very soft its actually quite hard you can feel the machine underneath the thin fur so i didnt think it was cuddly enough to fulfill its intention of being a lovey
2,unfortunately the engine is quite loud and clacked and the soundnoise is not convincing either we had a different idea it doesnt look as cute as expected
2,actually a nice music box however the engine is so loud that you have to make the melody very loud to hear it
2,unfortunately not so good for the priceone easily gets to the inside lying mechanics adjusts easilythere is still a lack of protection i would say also bad to close still capable of development too bad
2,it stops constantly due to a resistance of the fabric that covers the button onoff it is really tiring otherwise pretty soft and its adjustable
2,very sweet and fluffy otter my daughter likes to cuddle with it the mechanics while breathing is simply mega loud and its tangled all the time relaxed falling asleep cant be called that
2,its not good to handle because the electronic element must be very well hidden in the plush because small children should not be able to open thisthe abbreviation operation sometimes stops after a few seconds and has to be restartedthis interrupts the sleepin slumber status of the childsupplement on after only months the part has given up the mindsad and very shameful since it was given away to the granddaughter at that time now months
2,the otter is very soft and well processed the inside is removable so that the cuddly toy can be washed operation is simple and easy to use nevertheless this sleep aid is only partially suitable for babies the engine that lifts our stomach is unfortunately so loud that it completely overcomes the soothing sounds when they are set to a quiet volume if the sounds are at maximum volume you still hear the engine this is quite annoying since we cant use this product to fall asleep with all the functions only lift and lower the belly we decided to return the product
2,the engine is too loud and unfortunately too big for the whole
2,so the otter is super cute and i thought it would be a real companion for our son unfortunately it quickly broke of course after you could have sent it backthe breathing function no longer works and makes mechanical noises it should imitate the breathing movement but it is stuckwould everything have worked the otter at least stars from us
2,i offered this plush to my daughter when she was two years old because she had difficulty falling asleep on her own positive sweet cute nice music negative hard makes a funny noise in breathing mode you hear the mechanism that moves the belly stops constantly when you cuddle it because the child necessarily presses the button when he holds it in his arms to change the mode you have to open the back it is painful and difficult for the little fragile after a year it does not work anymore doesnt make it easy to fall asleep no more than another simple doudo too bad
2,the slumbery otter is a good idea and my boy finds it classy however our otter either has a wobble contact or is already broken after a very short time instead of min the functions run out within secondsfor the price not again disappointing
2,would be a nice sleeping toy if the engine of the belly breathing wasnt constantly defective i now sent the second one back with defectiveotherwise music and light very nice but for the price i expect a baby toy to last longer than months therefore i cant recommend it
2,the plush is much less cute than on the photos big head and is too heavy for a baby the box inside is very large the motor of the snoring makes a lot of noise especially if you put the rest of the sounds not strong to change the noises you have to open the back of the plush each time which is not practical the only positive point in my opinion is that the sounds melodies are pleasant and well adjustable in volume i had heard good opinions about this plush but i am very disappointed and i cannot return it once opened given how you have to open the cardboard to access it very bad
2,the plush is nice but baby constantly comes out the mechanism of the otters back which is very heavy and when baby throws through the face it hurts plus sounds of weird mechanisms oar moment im not sure of durability in short im very disappointed with the product i dont recommend despite the comments ive been able to read before ordering
2,too expensive for a duvet its not really magical its an ordinary musical duvet you have to change the batteries each month about for daily use it creates a nice atmosphere but personally i find that the price and very excessive for the concept
2,i bought this as a christmas present for my month old grandson we have changed the batteries but his belly has stopped working he absolutely loves it but now after not even a month its developed a fault how do i get a replacement
2,i received this article already in december because i expect young people in june and really looked forward to it after all the awards on instagram and co i noticed already at the first commissioning that one attitude gives an incredibly disturbing noise of itself and that the engine is still very loud during the breathing movement in my opinion therefore not at all suitable for newborns or babies the functions themselves are really sweet so i ordered it again in the hope that it was a sunday model unfortunately this was not the case
2,very cute tweezers light and soft music negative points it is impossible to use also duvet because it is very heavy because of the box inside it is necessary to remove the scratch each time to adjust the teddy so it serves as decoration in the bed of my son
2,very quiet and makes a popping noise
2,i gave the otter to my nephew for birth after weeks the otter was broken so a new one ordered and surprised broken again after months it is a mystery to me how this can happen because it lies only next to a month old baby plays music every once in a while and simulates breathing movements the mechanics of the breathing simulation is also what constantly breaks from kulanz amazon returns the money for stars i resist to order the otter a third time but at the express request of the father since the little one likes the otter there is a third attempt
2,i loved it and it has been very useful to sleep my baby but it has lasted days to spoil it no longer breathes and the sounds stop at the very beginning
2,my daughter is months old and likes to cuddle at night at her otter yes i also think that the engine is quite loud but that calms my baby even further super sound selection and very nice work november the electronics is unfortunately defective the belly lifts only briefly and then seems to clamp very bad
2,very nice plush but unfortunately no longer works after a monththe mechanism is not very reliablevery little used in additiondamage because we liked it well
2,in itself i find the otter great unfortunately we had already for the second time a model which after a few weeks is defective the button on the belly for automatic on and off was both times suddenly defective and does not work anymore the different sounds songs the light and also the optics are very nice and soothing and our daughter has become so accustomed to falling asleep with the little and i also that we will now probably or badly order one for the third time and hope that this will last longer this time
2,the slumber otter is actually a nice product the sounds as well as the breathing of the animal are soothing and the music is wonderful i was really excited about the otter that i bought as a gift for a newborn unfortunately after barely two weeks of use he already had a defect because the music and the breathing movement did not work properly anymore amazon quickly made a remedy and so i was able to exchange the product for the friends i had given it to unfortunately the second product after not even two months of use also shows the error which is very sad and leads to the fact that i will not give the otter any more
2,buy to offer to a baby we found that the belly mechanism does not work the baby we offered him to pretend to appreciate him for his softness and little music we cannot take back to himwe will have to order another one hoping that it will work this plush will come back very expensive
2,stops often when he has weight on it
2,i was really looking forward to the otter and was disappointed he looks super cute but unfortunately the engine that makes the breathing so loud and annoying that i never use it it cracks right and just seems cheap also bothers me that the operation lies inside and can only be opened with velcro this is then briefly also very loud and disturbs my baby
2,gift for my little girl who is months oldis it normal that there is not a manual for usemusic stops at the end of a minute while it is specified m
2,unfortunately i had to make the return for product not working
2,works very well but buying november does not work anymore it is expensive for only month of use really disappointed
2,the otter looks very cute the little night light on his belly is practical for the night and as a music box i find it not bad because the melodies are very nice and soothinghowever i bought it first of all because i thought that these breathing noises and lifting and lowering of the belly could be calming and helping to fall asleepmy child months first laughed and then she found it kind of stupidthe engine is very loud because you dont hear the rest of the noises well anymore unless you set the volume relatively high my personal opinion is that this part is not so helpful in sleep problems
2,i got the plush the engine noise makes more noise than the rest we dont hear the snoring and after minutes it didnt work anymore
2,unfortunately after a month and a half of use it stopped working it didnt cost little so i didnt expect it to last so little the time for the return had expired and therefore money wasted
2,functional carillon my month old girl falls asleep listening to the melodies that play sweetly for minutes i find it useless everything else breath and various sounds and i dont know if maybe the light can serve later the design is bad this animal nn is not at all nice to see for the little ones so much so that i had to make some changes put a pink dress add a bow in the head and create the eyes the controls are inside the puppet and therefore not practical if the baby sleeps awake with the noise of the tear that gives access to the various buttons for what it is it is really too expensive
2,cute weird toy imo overpricedreturn it my daughter doesnt like this otter
2,this thing was amazing it was the only way o could keep my son in his crib however it only last a month now the thing wont stay on even after changing the battery
2,very nice otter my daughter fell asleep very well but it was broken after a quarter of a year so that the belly did not rise any more and the music was played only brieflyfor the price very disappointing
2,we already ran the slumber otter during pregnancy august after a few months you could easily hear the engine now that it is in use every evening the engine is extremely loud to hear only when the movements from the stomach stop to enjoy the musicthat is really very bad
2,overall super processed very soft nice light great melodies but engine is so loud cant relax our child and after the other reviews i adjust myself to the fact that it will break quickly really a pity related to brand and price
2,the button to activate this is on the otters tummy and very sensitive so if my upset baby activates it it turns itself off immediately at the first breath it takes because the tummy expands and presses the button against the cuddling baby if i turn it on and keep it away from him its a miracle but he can never touch it or go near it or it will turn off immediately i have to watch these crycalmcrycalm dramas over the baby monitor and its infuriating the fisher price snug a puppy stays on for minutes once pressed i thought it was annoying at first why cant i turn this thing off but now i get it this thing could be revolutionary but it amounts to junk because the very sensitive button is smack dab in the center of the glowing and moving tummy which of course is where any baby or toddler will want to touch and cuddle immediately please make a new version that stays on and contact me or send it to me this thing is amazing when i play keep away with it but totally impossible to use for the purpose of self soothing just mom initiated and overseen soothing not good for babies who can move on their own
2,objectively a nice ideabut the mechatronics spins completely the abdominal movements are catastrophe it squeaks totallyunfortunately ive destroyed the packaging already because i cant exchange it
2,to be honest i dont get all the excitement about this fuzz ball i personally think its waaaay overpriced for the few functions that it has a very good substitute toy for this one is an elephant which has star projectormusicheart beat from walmart for i got as baby shower gift which is much more on demand than this toy i only like the music verity its very soft and beautiful but i hate that it has the light that you cant jut switch off it turns on w music or you cant disable to breathing there is a very stiff mechanical device inside the body so you gotta watch this toy dropping on the floor would have returned it immediately if we havent recycled the packaging box we opened allot of baby toys that day and all the wrapping was placed in trash can i ended up just regifting this toy to another person as is who had triplets
2,although we only have to change the hertones without movement of the body every weeks with our nightlight with music we did not even change the batteries in months we do not use the slumber otter more often than the nightlight so you should get a good supply of batteries
2,sweet otterbut after a very short time the cracking when inhaling becomes very disturbing as the engine noise overall really a pity great idea bad implementation
2,my month old baby loves this toy but it turns itself off instantly when the breathing feature is on so frustrating
3,was not snuggly for my grandson could feel the workings
3,the noise level of the machine has become much louder over time and interferes with falling asleep
3,engine of the otter way too loud
3,the otter is a nice gift with many great options as a music box it is greathowever i cant recommend it to cuddle because the engine inside is hard and it cant be cuddled and it is very difficult for small baby hands nevertheless a nice companion for the night
3,my niece doesnt like it when switched on and off the cuddly toy sucks enormously it looks cute and fluffy but also hard because of the electronics so no real cuddly toy i wouldnt buy it again
3,the otter is totally cute the sound is also great the motor is still quite loud i would have hoped that you could not hear it so clearly the otter would also have been a little better to be filled since you can tap the electronics battery my baby is not yet in the world yet i hope very much that the otter can calm them down or she can sleep well with him
3,we bought the otter around the black friday our daughter then got it at christmas and a month later it was unfortunately defective we got a new one very quickly however for stars however in my opinion you have to change the batteries very often which is why we switched off the breath and the air function thus the battery lasts longerour daughter likes the otter however i find the constant price fluctuations between and quite questionable for i would definitely not have bought the otter
3,unfortunately the otter doesnt work right from the start we slurped it in and after minutes at the latest it is out without any touch the lifting and senk movement when it works short is extremely loud cant imagine that it should be that wayunfortunately im very disappointed because we were so happy to have found something for our little one at last and then it just doesnt work rightin itself it would be a super great gift or a great companion for the little ones in the evening but just for that it would have to work
3,the description of this plush has sold of the dream and unfortunately i have been very on it it is not at all convenient to use to change modemusical to white noise you have to unscratch the opening behind it is the same to increase or decrease the volume and intensity of the brightness the sound or imitation of snoring the sound of the mechanism is not pleasant for the texture it does not have to say anything again it is very soft to the touch
3,have it given away
3,i find it really amazing how real this otter can breathe my son months unfortunately also because he is afraid of him he needs quite a long time to fall asleep and then i wanted to test if the otter helps him in fact he has fallen asleep two times when the part was lying on his belly while he was cuddled in my arm however he has got caught up in it and surrounded him directly awake and cried if it is in his bed he turns away from it during the day he does not touch the thing and makes a big bow around it so it is not suitable for him what i like is that you can wash the animal i dont like that it is not suitable for cuddling because of the large hard plastic part because it is too hard i still like the idea well but it is not useful if the child does not accept it
3,we bought this for our new born and loved it especially the breathing function where its chest raises and lowers methodically unfortunately after only a couple of months we have been disappointed to find this function is no longer working
3,cuddly but too heavy
3,the product itself is top the sounds too the plush is soft my monthold flea loves it she falls asleep with itafter a few days of use the sound stops after a few seconds and the heartbeat stops for the price im disappointed she wasnt well studied tribute obliged to contact the brands vas its my chip that is disappointed
3,i have received this little otter for my daughter but i have a problem i cant adjust the plushi have changed the batteries as indicated once i press on the belly of the otter she makes music and swells her belly seconds and stopsmaybe someone will have a solutionthank you in advance
3,we bought it as a gift visually it is a highlightvery sweet and well processedthe breathing movement and the light on the belly are also greatfor me the sound effects heartbeat and mothers womb sounds are too artificial and irritatingthe music is also not that what you know about musical clocks but rather psychedelic
3,the otter itself is cute and also cuddly unfortunately i have to say that i feel the engine as quite loud which does not contribute to falling asleep the music goes like this unfortunately they are not played very long and changes quickly also the noises i find sometimes rather disturbing rather than reassuring with us he unfortunately did not help
3,unfortunately after a few days it turned out that it has unfortunately a malfunction writed for a refund i should take over the shipping itself i should now pay for it that i got a b goods sent very disappointing the first few days it still worked only unfortunately the motor movement was rather loud from the beginning and then it has already given up the mind the music itself was beautiful only unfortunately does not work with the movement i am glad that i did not give it away
3,one of the otters has already given up the spirit it was for the grandchildren there were tears that one already does not work since i am not on site i can also do nothing send back etc a replacement would have been very good now we have a sad child
3,its a very pretty otter she really does what is marked she is very cute but im disappointed because i expected it to be much lighter at last to count her back and hard rigid and heavy not very pleasant to make her a calin
3,basically a good product only unfortunately not thought to end the otter lies with in the bed and seduces to cuddle only unfortunately the otter together with the inside lying operating unit is very hard and heavy and when breathing it crawls furthermore this super nice shell on the belly so interesting to press around that is played rather instead of sleeping in addition everyone who has a relative skillful child notices that it also has the velcro closure open within a very short time and presses around on the control unit
3,santa claus gift for our monthold baby positive points comforting and soft otter possibility to combine the different functions she breathes plays pretty lullabies white noises and lights up baby calms down faster with her negative points the engine noise and the sound of lullabies is a little too loud
3,the otter in it itself is nice but the mechanism is noisy not pleasant at all
3,it is a very practical toy my baby is almost three months old and it is ideal for you not to feel alone in the crib when we lay her downthe stick that it has is that it lasts half an hour and that to change from melody to sounds you have to open a velcro that is in the back and that makes a lot of noise and the baby wakes up
3,very cute look and works well but i would have liked to have a little more cuddly character due to the noise module the otter is quite heavy even for adultsmy daughter therefore always needs help if she wants to wear it in addition i find it a bit worrying especially with small children that the noise module is very easy to access only by velcro protectedwould have wanted me more child safety
3,the melodies are very soothing and not as intrusive as with other products also the light and the snoring function of the otter are quite pleasanthowever there are also some negative points as a cuddly animal for example the otter is not suitable at all and it is a mystery to me how in some reviews the talk of cuddly can bethe fabric is soft however the inner life of the stuffed animal is so huge and hard that it really cant be cuddlythe huge velcro fastener on the back of the otter is also very disturbing and can be opened very quicklyin addition the motor of the breathing function is so loud and annoying that it is not used in us at all therefore only stars for this sloping aid
3,since we have been looking for a great music box for a long time and overwhelmed the positive reviews i also ordered the otter when this came on we had to find out that the supplied batteries were empty if you dont have any in the house then you cant even test it that was the first minus point the second and then i have to connect to the negative reviews that the engine is simply too loud when lifting the belly and lowering it its also a disturbing noise also the white noise which is supposed to represent the bloodstream in the womb sounds rather like a radio station that has no reception for me personally it doesnt seem calming and my child does not have a calmer effect rather the opposite was the result the other sounds such as heart tones and ctg are not bad but for us not useful as we had to find out the third minus point goes to the soundleiser controller of course if its about minutes but i think that its even quieter my opinion is not too cute but its also nice to say its quiet in the big room
3,visually totally cute the fur is also super soft but unfortunately the cuddly toy is not well lined so you can feel the edges of the engine very clearly for cuddle the toy is not suitable besides the engine is extremely loud if you activate the breathing movementsdid it buy as a gift for a friend and unfortunately have a bachache when giving away i sewn extre an additional padding which i wrap around the engine so that the edges are not so hard i dont know why you design such a sweet and really great toy and then save on the padding and the volume shortly before closing
3,but the functionality of the builtin electronics especially at this price is not satisfactory pros fabric animal in itself well processed soft and optically appealing for children nightlight function good heartbeat function ie cons songs cannot be selected fixed loop mechanism which simulates the breathing of the stuffed animal viel too loud at low volume the music will simply overwhelm music playback quality is not satisfactory is accompanied by a very high unpleasant whistle tone since we wanted to use this stuffed animal mainly as a music clock this is unfortunately unusable for us i cant agree with the many positive reviews the otter the idea is still good goes back
3,its beautiful and we love it the bad thing is that the pile ends right away
3,disappointed from the visual
3,cute sweet but expensive for what it is
3,very heavy for a baby the use is for older over months or more but clear for that age it no longer serves the nanny and the sounds it has
3,very nice soft and excellent workmanshippeccato for the mechanism with the battery compartment that is disproportionately too large and makes the back of the plush hard and overall the object too heavy
3,dear for what it is indicated sold with battery received box broken and without battery for the price the batteries are rigorous
3,my son had fallen in love with it
3,as has been mentioned before the frame in which the engine is in is not reasonably padded so that you can feel the hard edges i find it impractical that you can only make adjustments when you open the back part it might be more practical if you press at the foot or at the ear to handle certain sounds i find like some others that the engine works far too loudly so that it overtones the sounds and completely irritates them in the technical development of today it is certainly possible to develop a better engine performance i expected more from fisherprice for the price
3,sweet guy but he doesnt help to fall asleep the noise level of the engine is unfortunately made in chinaour son has been having sleep problems for weeks because you are close to despair you just try everything that the marketing of the baby industry gives of course without success noises and songs are quite nice but is the technology in there very big and heavy our month old child i dont want to put that in parlor cars
3,we bought it for our monthold baby who has a hard time falling asleep and we only get him to do it on the chest in bed and the truth is that he has not listened to it nor does it happen to sleep nor to play it strikes him zero the toy itself meets all the features it announces it is adorable warm and soft but in our case it does not fulfill its purpose of relaxing and sleeping the baby
3,the otter is really very nice and the melodies or sounds also great chosen and implemented i also find the imitation of breathing and the little light great besides the outer part can be washed well unfortunately it did not work at all in our case we have already had it for a few months and it uses nothing up to now on the contrary if our baby hears it looks it wants to play with it and becomes even more awake it misses because purpose completely we would have been incredibly happy for a sleep aid moreover the electronic unit in the belly is still very hard through the fabric if the otter is swirled around and hits the head that is not exactly pleasant yes really so happened otherwise it is really very beautiful he is now just a very expensive hard cuddly animal with special effects
3,pretty good product a little disappointed with the weight of the plush with the mechanism otherwise the sound is goodthe more negative point is the scratch to have access to the buttons to change music and others that makes a lot of noiseif not sweet pretty and especially the main one my daughter loves it
3,the otter is super sweet and cuddly soft also the volume control is great it can be set to sleep with very quiet the slumber light is quite dark but sufficient its better to change a bit too dark than too bright you can switch between music and natural sounds or even use only the slumber light thats really great the pressing of the belly around the last setting to activate again is easy also for the baby the sense of the roaring belly that moves does not open up to me but many babies like that we would also like to keep it very much but the electronic unit is apparently too big with motor etc so that the otter is too heavy to be kept by a baby we would simply be afraid that the otter falls on the face if our little one gets taken up somehow really a pity because the otter really unites everything we have looked for as a sleep aid silence separate light beautiful song selection automatic switch off
3,i bought the slumber otter for my son at christmas looks cute unfortunately you can only turn on the different functions if you open the back with velcro closure which is quite loud also the loud can only be set like this too bad because actually i like the functions and my son also likes to listen to the music to fall asleep would only like to change the noise or the volume but this is not possible without opening the otter only on and off goes without opening the great function that the belly lowers and lifts as when breathing is unfortunately also so loud that you can not use it to fall asleep actually great idea but somehow not well implemented especially for the very high price
3,since our son months always struggles very much with the evening sleep i ordered the slumber otter the service is easy the music is not intrusive and can be exhibited at any time and the cover of the otter is washable so actually the perfect sleephelp i thought unfortunately our little one found the otter obviously very frightening because always when i tried to put it carefully beside him he started to cry short and short to give away certainly very nice but one also runs the risk that the children do not accept it and as with us exactly the opposite occurs too bad i as a mom found the otter great
3,too cute very fast delivery i only put stars because the otter came dirty
3,shes too cute the music and sounds are very nice its just a pity that the mechanism that mimics the breath is so noisy its kind of messing up
3,i am shared because i love this toy but big flat the engine noise that allows the belly to move but fortunately we can disable it but it removes the attraction that ns had bought this toy precisely before this function otherwise adjustable volume and several functions i like music heart noise bof
3,i expected something better given the cost
3,an otter changes on the other hand it depends on the people i thinkadvantage you can separate the case from the plush to wash iton the other hand the motor noise is not top and the noisy scratch makes you learn to press through blindly to change the melodies and volume
3,my first impression was that it didnt really look like the picture and that something looked wrong with it when it started breathing that was all i needed its just too creepy for me the kids dont seem to care but its not something i would pick up and say cute
3,get it quickly packaging to protect the item in the package not top amazon the plush be it there should be more choices i dont find the otter to my liking but the choices offered are top so
3,our daughter didnt care about it and it certainly doesnt mellow her out but shes months and very high energy my wife thinks its adorable
3,super cute toy and very soft i like that you can choose all the setting to personalize the otter like the sounds volume light and so on the only thing i dont love is when you have the belly function on it make sort of a robotic noise and if baby is holding it tightly it makes a clicking noise as it tries to move overall great toy but a little bit pricey for a musical stuffed animal
3,i loved this at first then after a few weeks it became very sensitive i have changed the batteries multiple times so its not an issue with having dead or dying batteries any time tummy part is touched it shuts off very frustrating i love the light up feature wish it stayed on waste of money maybe i have a defective one
3,i wanted to love this but its too much maintenance to utilize definitely something parents can wait to buy when the baby is months or older i wish i didnt have to open the back of the sloth every time i want to utilize everything the sloth does i would also like it to be more stuffedsquishy to hold it fall short on the cuddling factor the box inside in huge and obviously hard the sound and vibration has good payoff but user friendly its not unless youre content just pushing the tummy to do thing versus going to the back and opening it up over and over to utilize everything it can do btw the back opening is made of velcro i think its over priced for the payoff factor of enjoyment that is lacking with this toy to sooth a baby or toddler
3,in itself this is really a nice sleep aid but already after a short time the otter does not play seconds at a time for this the price is quite overpriced very sad unfortunately the return period at the time was already at the end
3,very very sweet cuddly animalunfortunately the movement of the belly is very loud and rapples somehow
3,i dont normally write reviews but for this i will its cute very soft the night light and music is great but the motor in it that makes it appear to be breathing which is the soothe factor for babies honestly its pretty noisyfor kind of has a annoying hum to it i think if youre going to pay for something like this it should be dead silent furthermore when i turned it on it squeaked every time the belly went up it was annoying i actually took it apart opened up the electronic box and found that the up and down part of the mechanism is operated by a motorized wheel and and a tiny rubber belt not kidding i wdd that rubber belt it took hours to carefully put it all back together it has to line up perfectly for the moving parts to work perfectly there is no more squeak thank god the motor still has a quiet hum to it honestly my kid likes to turn it on an off and could care less to cuddle it more so its a otter that entertains her and holds her pacifiers for her at night nice idea but kinda overpriced
3,beautiful cuddly music box with very pleasant sounds the only drawback the music box lights up at the belly where it is also switched on and off my child grasps the light and the clock is already off
3,in itself it is a sweet cuddly toytoy but the price is too high
3,actually he is well thought out and the thought behind it really great my daughter always fell asleep very quickly for music we used him months daily unfortunately he is already broken
3,in itself a nice cuddly animal unfortunately the volume of the engine disturbs us if the animal lies next to the babys head one hears it clearly furthermore the engine is also very poorly padded for almost the disadvantages outweigh
3,the otter is very cute however we find that the motor is quite loud the loudness control could be smaller
3,otti is really sweet and has nice features that help our baby to fall asleep unfortunately the movement is stuck on the stomach very sad i would not have thought that such a product would break so quickly would like to complain but i find here no way
3,broken in week vibrant function not working
3,very sweet cuddly seal unfortunately a little difficult to operate as the velcro fastener is exactly on the buttons of the remote control furthermore the sound of the drive is too loud when the book is up and down
3,the controller inside of otter is too chunky and hard i was expecting very soft snuggly toy for nighttime my old throw it out from crib all the time she doesnt like it other than that it works fine
3,the otter is basically very sweet and fluffy but unfortunately the motor for the abdominal movement is very loud and thus extremely disturbing
3,looks very cute nice music but unfortunately the engine is a bit noisy and rather annoying when falling asleep
3,at first everything worked fine but the third time the batteries were already empty i wouldnt have expected that at the price too bad
3,the mechanism is a little noisy when breathing and if the tummy touches baby when the otter takes a breath the gentle pressure it creates turns the otter off but i love the sounds and the light their is a volume control which is great overall i like it just wish it wasnt as sensitive
3,sweet otter but it could be better upholstered
3,and it practically didnt help my baby falling asleep
3,the otter switches off directly again and the breathing movement no longer works in addition the light flickered if it worked when the otter didnt cause any problems unfortunately the product was not bought directly via amazon so i dont get it replaced must now send it back and buy it again but is now euros more expensive very a pity
3,im so torn with this toy i want to love it but im not sure if i do hence giving it a midrange rating its super cute but not overly cuddly for a bedtime toy due to the power pack inside the breathing function is really cute but the mechanism that pushes the tummy in and out is noisy and my daughter months old learnt very quickly that she could force it downwards so ive had to turn it off the buttons being on the inside means that its difficult to adjust any of the settings while youre laying there with a baby possibly probably laying on one arm while you try to get them to sleep it has a super stiffscratchy fisher price label sticking out of the side which couldve been made from silky material as this is a comfort toy and the last negative its really overpriced for what it is it should be at most positives as said its really cute you can wash it the lullabies breathing and heartbeat noises are all soothing and lovely and my daughter does really like it which was the aim of buying it so i guess its doing its job
3,great otter but just not for this price it is super nice and also suitable for giving away well i am simply not so excited because of the price
3,the otter is beautifully processed and has a nice facethe sounds and music are ok but they dont help us sleep so its just a nice cuddly animal
3,engine too loud
3,he is really cute but i had imagined him even better processed the fur is nice soft but does not look so good and the mechanics of the belly crunches
3,the outside of the product is soft but is otherwise very hard the price did not seem to match the overall quality of the product when compared to other products that are similar
3,this feels nice and soft my son didnt like the music or the weight he likes our dogs ikea lion better i ended up taking the battery pack out this is a very expensive night light that i had to take out of my sons crib because he was stepping on the otter to lean over ive removed the pack and he plays with as a stuffed animal
3,works well enough and i like the features but the breathing tiny makes a lot of mechanical noise and has started to squeak after about weeks of use it also gets stuck sometimes and i have to force it out of its jammed position so i wonder if its going to break at some point
3,a very nice cuddle cuddly toy and sleep aid unfortunately he makes after one because a strongly quenching noise when one activates the breathing the noise is so disturbing that we use the otter only without it very bad
3,did this otter buy for my nigre her baby but after month it doesnt work anymore could i get a phone number from them if my niece can turn vileicht could she get a new otter for her baby lg katharina
3,cute otter i found the breathing sounds a bit too loud so i turned them off otherwise a nice music box
3,i returned this i got it originally for the features and wondered if itd be a mistake since the outside is not removable and washable i was so surprised that it was not even for snuggling it was so hard for the money especially i couldnt understand why this childs sleeping lovey was not in the least bit snuggly advertised
3,it is very cute and the light is nice and soft the sounds are ok but dont play long enough the breathing feature has a weird mechanical sound to it so didnt use it i was excited to get this but ultimately would not recommend
3,i love the otter my granddaughter had so i bought one on amazon for my other granddaughter i was excited to give it to her but when it plays the expanding bag in the belly which mo es to imitate breathing makes a popping sound when it is in motion the sound takes away from the soothing that the item is intended for im disappointed
3,the otter is very nice and has many functions but does not bring our son to rest at all the effect is not recognizable the electronics inside is very large and also loud but certainly a nice gift idea
3,very nice as from previous descriptions piles already inserted but since in the package is indicated of music and qs after only breaths turns off there is something wrong
3,its very nice and soft but in my opinion its not worth the price it doesnt do so many things as i expected and its also a bit noisybut its nice the ideamy son of months doesnt consider it much unfortunately
3,too bad the mechanism doesnt hold any more time dear for the duration
3,very nice but its stopped working and its only got a month and it hasnt been for use and its not the batteries
3,my daughter doesnt even marry him i thought id help her sleep but she doesnt like it
4,plush tender my monthold loves it sleeps hugged and cuddles him even when he wakes up i put four stars because unfortunately at least in my case the mechanism that makes the belly of the puppet raise and lower emits an annoying hum however it remains effective in the function of the white noises and of the breath that reconcile the sleep to my baby accompanying her towards a deep sleep and now is for her an indispensable companion it does not do miracles if sleeplessness or agitation are due to other ailments eg identification you have to intervene to solve those but even in these cases the plush helps the child at least to relax and comfort along with the cuddles of mom and dad obviously
4,beautiful soft and very relaxing it comes with behind back the keys you can select for the volume the notes for the type of music to select the type of noise you want to put heart beat white noise etc the belly moving or not the light on or off all these keys are great and customizable depending on what the baby wants my months is used to sleeping with the music box all night long and otter has a duration of min but alas i wouldnt know if she might like it since she doesnt sleep absolutely with puppets but i can say that to this she has become fond of in a hurry which is very strange we will see in the next nights if i can introduce her into the dwarfs anyway recommended purchase the only flaw is that euro shipping is too much at the end it costs less in the store
4,good product even though my daughter doesnt listen to him
4,you accompany my grandson to sleep it helps him pity it only lasts hr
4,i like it very much
4,for now my little months seems to like it its very soft the only bad thing is that to change sound you have to open it
4,well nothing shrill with smooth movement my boy liked it
4,its too big its hard for the baby to catch
4,suitable for gifts soft and pleasant
4,we love our otter unless the batteries last very little or is that the belly with your breathing fails
4,it was a gift and they liked it very much
4,product in perfect condition to change so you have to open the back and it is a bit cumbersome soft touch
4,very nice but has hard parts for a baby
4,very nice doll for newborns and children not so young
4,we like the possibility of setting the volume of the melody and light a little noisy depending on
4,i bought this otter for my grandson likes a lot and fits i recommend this product
4,too cute very sweet
4,offered at christmas for a monthold babyperfect sleeping companioncalent and relaxing music
4,all cute perfectly agree with my monthold son to calm down and help him fall asleep
4,its perfect
4,very cute little plush offered for christmas
4,article conforming to the description
4,soft and functional puppy remains more than trying on the arrival of baby
4,a product dearly beautiful my oneyearold loves it with white noise and falls asleep my son of is terrified when he sees him breathing
4,super cuddly otter the songs are very relaxing and animate to sing along unfortunately the engine is extremely loud and at the lowest volume you can hardly hear the music also that in and out it cracks constantly really very bad that the manufacturers did not use a quieter engine
4,so the otter is really cute and practicalmy minis sleep quite well with it but what im a little complaining about is the velcro fastener on the back better would have been a zipper or buttons if you operate the otter in the night you have to make really rough because of the velcro fastener but otherwise it is great
4,very sweet great sounds but a bit clunky i would still buy again the baby is still in the belly and listen to the gentle music from the inside
4,sweet idea but the noise level is sometimes a bit too loud and difficult to adjust
4,i love the little otterworked well to help baby sleep but after months with minimal use the belly stopped working and the music would play for about seconds and shut off i love the music though and it will still play by pressing the play button in the back
4,my little one loves this little otter she immediately grabbed it and snuggled up with it shes currently months i love the breathing motion my only gripe is that its in the front on the belly so if she squishes it too hard she turns it off then i have to press it to turn it back on again other than that great product
4,in itself great highly recommended also for children who get the otter only after months unfortunately the otter had to exchange once because the breathing function was defective after days
4,super sweet companion but the mechanics for the abdominal movement is simply annoyingly loud fortunately it can be switched off
4,otti is top the only thing that disturbs easily is the noise when the belly goes up and down and the inside part is very large otti should be better fed that he is not so hard
4,the otter is sooo sweet my daughter loves him unfortunately he constantly turns off despite new batteries
4,find nothing for babies mine is months and only looks uninteresteda disadvantage to get to the volume control light control etc must be opened the velcro closure this is quite loud when the baby sleeps however you can also switch off on the abdomen easily
4,this is a very sweet plush toy the music is quite relaxing as is the breathing mechanism my only compliant is that the switch off push button is quite sensitive so much so that my month old turns it off without intending to then i have to turn it back on which interrupts our bedtime routine but we still love it
4,ive been eyeing this soother since i got the notification that fischer price was making it my little one loves it so much only downside is that the settings are easily changed through the fabric in the back still adorable though
4,we love the otter its really great i think its best that the music runs for minutes and not just minutes for all similar things the child can fall asleep with relaxed music
4,the otter is really very sweet and plays everything super but the mechanics is really loudwhich you can turn off otherwise i find it really great to fall asleepnevertheless a great gift for birth
4,the otter is very nice and with its various functions light music movements very individually adaptable to the preferences of the baby the volume is also very well adjustable only small disadvantage is the weight of the otter our rating stars
4,i love this otter i love the melody my son always knows when the music starts now is sleep time
4,a great and reassuring support when falling asleep my child loves her little ottiunfortunately you can notice the music box very clearly a stronger padding would be an advantage herenevertheless i dont want to do without it
4,good product over all but little pricey you can find a similar toy for about we had it now for about a month the toy uses up the batteries quickly so make sure to stock up on them my favorite sound is the white noise which soothes our colicky baby the toy is pretty large has volume control which is perfect good variety of sounds the moving belly seems to be unnecessary and doesnt make a difference for our baby the glow feature is great the material is soft i gave it stars because while the toy is awesome i wish it had a sound self activation feature for when baby cries and you cant turn it on i hope the manufacturer considers this our baby loves this toy and we take it with us everywhere
4,my kids love this and its a great idea but the motor is noisy which is annoying considering how its kind of expensive i wish they would just go all the way with this lovely thing and take the time to put in a quieter device for the stomach movementmy kids still use it every night and i love the soft lullabies not at all creepy or loud or obnoxious sounding very nice soft music
4,hes much bigger than i originally thought he would be my daughter seems to like it ok but im not sure he was worth the amount of money ive already had to replace the batteries and shes only two months old i dont even use it every night the snoring is a little creepy with the stomach movement but my daughter likes the heartbeat sound with the lighted belly most i think if the price point was a little lower it would definitely be worth it
4,great otter you can adjust the volume the breathing the sound and the melody yes or no i think thats greatthe individual melodies change independently our son likes the otter and likes to listen to it
4,easy to use could be a bit thicker upholstered around the inside many settings possible you have to try there first would buy it again
4,find the on and off function not exactly good quite large and hard therefore rather only suitable for lying next to it
4,super cute but a bit harder than i was expecting this was due to the mechanism inside but not as cozy and cuddly as my daughter wanted
4,looks cute but when it is breathing it is really noisy didnt work well on by baby unfortunately
4,this little guy is so adorable the only issue i have is that it is hard to figure out how to get it to work there is a tiny hardtoclip that needs to be turned there was nothing in the paperwork that mentioned this detail otherwise once we got it working it was great our grandson especially loves the heartbeat swooshing sound
4,this has been helpful for car rides to soothe baby girl i just wish the light on it was a bit brighter to give a nightlight effect for the car
4,the only thing that disturbs something is the engine noise of breathing whereby this function can also be arranged as a cuddly toy of course a bit hard yet my daughter likes the otter very much
4,actually a super nice thing works well and has a soothing way the mechanical noise of the breathing is a bit louder but is still perfectly fineoverall beautiful product
4,overall a great part however this breath button cracks sometimes in certain positions which is annoying
4,i bought the otter for my son as a sleep aid and since then it has been used every day the light and the music seem soothing the fabric does not feel as highquality as hoped but otherwise we are completely satisfied
4,i bought it for my enkerl
4,great quality
4,he is very sweet yet a little loud to put him right next to a baby
4,my daughter loves him in principle stars worth if he only goes a trace even quieter otherwise wonderful clock absolutely recommended
4,not long in use until now great the only thing that could be changed is the clasp i find velcro very unfavorable because you might wake up the baby again if you want to switch
4,great toy but something heavy
4,cute and has several different features
4,very sweet otter which does what he should even more what bothers me personally but maybe its just right for others you have to adjust the volume or switch the velcro fastener at the back each time even for my little fingers there is quite little room for it so again a bit annoying but all in all a great particle
4,fulfills his purpose unfortunately goes out too early but my daughter still doesnt want to exchange himbeautiful melodies and very soothing
4,we loved him very much he accompanied my mouse from the beginningunfortunately he broke too fastthe engine has become so loud
4,never again without i thought for a long time if i buy the otter there as i find it the price is already very high but never again without my little man loves his otter and feeling he is looking forward to it every evening so with us in the house the purchase definitely more than paid off
4,now that weve been more busy with these things we know its better and in real its not so cute
4,super cute but really expensive the sound could be a bit better but already super sweet when the belly moves and glows
4,in itself the product is really great there is a small light that you can also switch off optionally the volume of the night music can also be adjusted pleasantly however i find the noise while moving the belly during the breathing process quite loud and disturbing
4,we like the music box very well a star trigger because the breath function is very loud
4,such a great music box loudness can be super regulated like the other sounds unfortunately the small engine slows down after a while
4,very sweet but you can really hear the noise from the engine so a star trigger
4,i love the slumber otterof course my son toothere are different soundswe always use the music and even i can relax as a mama
4,neutral smell in itself great product unfortunately it surrs a little
4,we as parents were more happy to have it than our baby he has it since he was months old and till now he is months old he has no interest on it even he enjoys playing with all the other toys i cant really say that it helped our baby with sleep circle
4,all right but its a little too quiet for us
4,everything great with the otter our little one is completely in love with him also the battery wear is manageable
4,everything went well
4,since the rd day my son weeks old sleeps alone with the otter a
4,i initially bought this for my month old son i found it to be too big and heavy for him i didnt find the breathing mechanism helped at all for sleep i ended up giving it to my yearold who loved it what i like about it lighting the otter emits a very soft nonbluelight glow which i think is great and does not disrupt sleep battery life i purchased this months ago and ive had to replace the batteries once and it is used nightly very soft and cute washes well and still looks new the older child loves it drawbacks i agree with previous reviewers that the breathing mechanism is quite loud i can hear it from across the hallway when my daughter engages the button in the night she doesnt seem to mind while its cute i find it too large for younger babies and even potentially dangerous for them in a crib its about the size of a cabbage patch doll the settings are on the inside of the otter so if you need to or want to change volume settings you have to do so before the baby is in bed or you might wake up the baby with the strong velcro closure i also had a hard time getting the right settings working it seems to be in demo mode at times small children can open the velcro on the back and pull out the light and breathing mechanism box my daughter does this in the night sometimes and uses the inside mechanism as a flashlight its safe but still annoying to have her remove it constantly then ask me to put it back inside overall i think this is better suited to older babies or toddlers my toddlers sleep has improved generally since this otter was introduced she likes to take care of the otter and is comforted by the gentle glow and sweet songs
4,our daughter loves this otter he has a pleasant song melody and you can change batteries and nothing is broken when printingthe sound of moving the belly is a little louder but it doesnt bother my child a gentle light on the belly also brings her peace
4,the otter is great and our baby loves it the only flaw is that the batteries are very quickly empty when you have the light on that attracts quite aba he is super sweet and very fluffy you can adjust the volume and the different program are great since babies always react to other sounds and find comforting
4,my son got this otter with months at that time he didnt care about it now with months he is starting to like it the engine noise for the abdominal movement is really loud but doesnt bother him and you can turn off the individual functions
4,i ordered the otter as a gift for a become mommy she was totally thrilled unfortunately the otter lost the function breathing bob rises up and down even before birth the amazon customer service was super helpful however and sends a new
4,the slumber otter actually works for adults as well was actually much more a selfexperiment the function was switched to the sleep function after min the otter goes out automaticallythe own breathing comes into a quiet rhythm and thus actually helps to fall asleepproduct so far great the only thing that bothers me is the shape of the head in my eyes not really coherent but half as wild
4,its cute but i dont like that the buttons are easily accessible to my toddler
4,this toy is recommended for young babies actually my newborn baby doesnt like it but my years old daughter hugs it for sleeping every night
4,i gave it to my grandson of weeksdelivery super fast as promised always happy
4,ideal for children
4,nice gift breathing not as natural as expected
4,a bit expensive but lovely soothing music
4,very sweet the light is good the music is beautiful the real heartbeat very soothingbeautiful would be if you could make something quietersimply ridiculous on the other hand i find the snoring there comes a comic noise √† la chrr pijuuu does not need such a person
4,an optically totally sweet playmate the varied and individually controllable functions convince me the engine also does not feel as too loud however the control element is very large and also heavy for small childrens hands in addition the cuddly otter from the back is not well lined so that you can feel the edges of the engine strongly for this there was a star trigger because it takes on cuddly quality i will add something to our otter from the back to make it softer the necessary space is available in the music box
4,the otter is visually really very sweet and also feels very cuddly but as some others have pointed out the engine is quite loud and at least not well padded in the back machines washable even only cold possiblei like the settings in themselves and the light is also very pleasantso if you dont mind the buzzing of the engine it is a great toy
4,we are very satisfied with the slumber otter one criticism is that the switches of the otter lie under a velcro fastener which is very loud to open and thus wakes the child if you want to adjust something elsea zipper or a remote condition would have been the better variantotherwise we are satisfied and if you want to have all the functions onoff you can simply press the otter on the belly
4,unfortunately the otter was defective or mechanically broken at delivery from hungary so it was sent backthats no problem the shipping costs of will be refundedoptically the otter is very appealing for babies my son immediately reacted to itthe otter is fluffy but also clumpy so it might be suitable for cuddles later i would probably fill it with cotton wool and then sew it
4,a little expensive but this dimmer light is super the volume is okay i find the otter quite large therefore only stars top is that the otter is washable when you remove the inside
4,we find the otter very sweet and it is a great music box replacementour baby is not yet in the world but i already play the songs before us hope they will be recognized againthe melody is very soothing also for methe motor for the abdominal movement is too loud for me we will not use thateverything else is very good noise light volume regulation
4,baby loves this we have in the the bedroom with him every night
4,fast delivery
4,for my unborn granddaughter
4,could be a little quieter
4,i have to say that the otter looks incredibly sweet and i have fallen in love with it of course it was tried out immediately there is a velcro closure behind it when you open it you have the device in front of you where you can change batteries and also the different modes can choose there are two volume buttons loud and quiet adjustable in three volumes below there is the button to play music then there is the button to set noises that come by chance mothers womb sounds these remind me the heart tones of the child what you hear during ultrasound then there is still the heartbeat and the breathing noise the sounds come by chance you cant pick them out then there is the button that the otter breathes and a button for light i have to say that the music is really soothing and even for us as adult is beautiful the breath actually looks very realistic but you can hear the engine very clearly what can be perceived as disturbing the otter is really nice to have the music played and the otter has not been able to breathe
4,everythings great
4,relaxed falling asleep
4,i immediately fell in love with the little one when i saw him although i spent some time with the little one because i dont let any children sleep here myself i finally got him i always have friends with her baby to visit and thought so i could give the dwarf a more pleasant time here if we sit longer the little animal is really very cute however with me the picture is much better set in scene than the original the good one looks something as if he had run against a wall but beside the flat somewhat wide head it is still quite inseparable however if the content is not there the electronics can be removed very easily by a velcro lock in the back and operated the surrounding body which therefore represents the otter is soft and fluffy but to me almost thin you feel the content nevertheless very strongly and i have some concerns if the child would roll on it to be lucky babies that will be quite rare here i would have just wished for some more light the edges are not clearly the same as well as well as the rest of the rest
4,a really great kleijer otter nice as a sleep aid for the baby very soft and fluffy nice to cuddle and an ideal gift for birth because if a baby accepts this otter as a sleep aid and uses it then only the attempt helps you can not estimate that before the small otter makes music or sounds eg heartbeat or snoring the batteries are already inserted and therefore of course included in the scope of delivery i like the breathing the belly moves visibly with the breathing supersweet you can expand the battery part well and wash the otter thus well there is a long hidden velcro connector at the back at the battery compartment you can also make various settings zb sleep and snarch sounds various light piano music volume light and up to minutes running time a great idea we like very well unfortunately i have already discovered on this fluffy fur on the st view draw threads for this i pull off star that should happen with baby toys from the company is also good for older cases
4,bought as a gift for new family member otter seems to be a big hit and soon sends her to sleep
4,very cute otter and really very soft ÁöÑ you have to remove a scratch to change the programs breathing noise light music fan belly movement and change the volumes associated with all these programs too bad that there is a mechanical noise when the otter moves the belly it doesnt at all make natural breath of the blow the program goes off itself so convenient to help a baby fall asleep nice ideas but didnt work for my monthold son though i recommend it anyway
4,very good product my daughter and i are conquered sweet super adorable puppy the sounds and music are great breathing on the belly makes all the difference its very appreciative only flat having to open the scratch to change the music but i recommend
4,purchase made for my daughter for months and weeks i wanted to try to gradually make her autonomous its only been a few days that she has but she manages to be calmer at night and more patient to see in the future if he does his job well the only bemole i find her we feel too much the box
4,im crazy about this article that allows my daughter to fall asleep alone in a restless way and that overnightonly a little hick when my daughter serves the otter against her it turns her off you have to press the button to start again
4,it is super cute does all it is supposed to i personally love it however my baby is afraid of it she is mo at night but loves to play with it during the day she understands how to turn it on and off by pressing the belly
4,i havent really understood the hype around this otter so fari bought the slumber animal as a gift but tried it myself out of interest beforei felt the breathing noises were disturbing and despite the timer the music continued to doddle in endless loops in the early morning hours
4,sweet otter for the very small onesunfortunately the engine is very disturbing you can hear it extremely when the otter breathesotherwise to look at it sweetly and the light is very practical at night the melodies and sounds are pleasant would use it right from birth so that the children get used to it
4,super sweet otter to fall asleepin many reviews it is mentioned that the otter is not so cuddly it is already soft and cuddly however you should not forget that there is an engine in the otter this ensures after all for music and the abdominal movement and for that it is quite cuddlywe find the otter great and make it go to bed in the evening
4,a little pricey for a baby toy but our baby likes the noise and soft light helps keep baby asleep in our noisey house
4,the batteries do not last long
4,we and our daughter love the otter it has many functions is totally fluffy and the volume can be adjusted super the only drawback and therefore also a star pull off the engine is very loud when breathing which is why we cannot use the functionwe will buy another otter for the sibling because it arrives so well
4,i am very satisfied with the slumber otter you can adjust the volume of the music individually i like the choice of the sleeping songs that it plays i also like that you can also switch off the abdominal movement the only drawback is that it is relatively hard you could have taken better care of the price that the otter is better padded out because you can feel the engine very clearly thats why there is also the one point deduction
4,great and so realistic with heartbeat music breathing and light volume can be regulated and by pressing on the belly can deactivate the set function as well as activate again this is great you just have to love it unfortunately the breathing function cracks already after a short time which can be very disturbing when falling asleep also it imposes itself more often but otherwise a real lovable and great stuffed animal
4,the otter is incredibly cute and invites you to cuddle you can switch between different melodies snoring heartbeat and rasping you can adjust that it makes breathing movements and that its belly glows a star trigger is there for you to see nowhere which songs these are and the engine that represents the breathing is relatively loud otherwise great
4,our twins dear emmet as we have baptized him the only thing i have to complain about is that you cant hire him to play longer after minutes the music is off i would have wished that you could decide for yourself because if the babies are restless i would need h or h so i have to get up and go on again otherwise ingenious the part
4,great stuffed animal our sixmonthold son loves it so far we did not have a defect after about four months of use and the otter is also good washable there are two criticisms however why a star was pulled off the engine for the breathing movement is relatively loud especially if the environment is very quiet like for example to fall asleep and also the quietest volume of the melodies sounds is not yet quiet enough for our taste we have meanwhile switched to rechargeable batteries since the otter is a battery eater when used so buy your wallet and the unworldly for your sake suitable batteries
4,the otter is definitely positive with our baby the melodies are also bearable for adults and please the child it is still relatively cuddly despite all the technical interiorsthe night light is a little weak but that was not the most important thing for us when buyingas a dad i can only criticize the processing of the velcro fastener at the back and the screw connection of the battery compartment at first i think that one could find a more subtle solution at the back despite all this the whining is at a high level and i can make a clear purchase recommendation
4,my little one months falls asleep much better at first i was skeptical whether such a part really brings something our little one only falls asleep when you weigh it or wear it if he is tired now we put the otter next to him and he finds himself in sleep however there is a point trigger because the motor that makes the breathing movement is really loud and because this whole construct in the otter is really clumsy
4,the fisher price soothe n snuggle otter is absolutely adorable this little guy is a welcome addition in our home the material is plush and incredibly soft press the belly and it plays classic lullabies like twinkle twinkle little star plus other soothing music that is sure to calm and relax your little one his belly glows through a seashell shaped piece while the abdomen area rises and falls gently as if hes really breathing all the different features are easily accessible through velcro pieces on his back the buttons are all conveniently labeled with little pictures so you wont have any problems adjusting the volume up and down or turning off the glowing light feature i really like how youre able to customize the features to whatever your baby prefers for example you can have the music playing but disable the light and breathing features or have the lights on with the music but shut off the moving belly one of the first things i noticed was how heavy this toy is not heavy for an adult but my month old can just barely hold it up the weight is the result of the gigantic battery which fills up most of the inside while the outside material is cozy and soft the huge rectangular shaped battery makes it awkward to cuddle i cant imagine any child snuggling up with this comfortably since it would be like lying with a plush covered brick my daughter who is months old was not initially impressed with the otter she hardly even glanced at it i ended up putting it beside her diaper changing area and the soothing lights and sounds are now a wonderful distraction when i need her to be still this also would have been a great toy to have when she was an inconsolable infant i think babies under one are far more likely to enjoy this toy compared to older toddlers who may get bored easily high quality just like most fisher price toys but im giving stars because i wouldnt describe this as snuggly
4,this is charming we all love this toy the otter is so cute and the breathing is adorable theres a little mechanical sound i dont like there are four sounds the otter makes including something that is supposed to sound like when baby was still in the uterus but no ocean which is our favorite on the sleep sheepone major concern however is the otters arms my yo demonstrates how they can act as handcuffs for a young child and even though i cant say for certain that this would be problematic it strikes me as potentially dangerous so buyer beware
4,great
4,super cute and soft on the other hand the otters breathing mechanism makes enough noises and sometimes blocks so i disable it only negative point
4,my monthold daughter adopted it right away the only drawback is that the batteries will quickly deload it will falsify to invest in rechargeable batteries otherwise the case will disassemble easily to allow to mete the otter to wash
4,very pretty her belly swells under soft music so that it reminds the baby of moms breathingdespite that our daughter does not hang at allmaybe she is an exception difficult to judge but it remains a beautiful product
4,a little weird face
4,i love music and light but the breathing mechanism broke after only weeks the rest still works but im disappointed
4,i really like this and im glad i bought it for my daughter who is months the only reason i havent starred it is because to change the settings you have to open the velcro and it sooo noisy that it disturbs her seems counterproductive if it had poppers maybe if you preselect something you can just press its tummy to turn it on so its not the end of the world still a lovely bedtime routine aid with plenty of different sounds and the breathing in and out tummy movements are a nice touch
4,pro aspects of this plush for newborns musical plush but also able to reproduce the movement of breathing customizable music sounds various gaming experiences sensory and not washable in washing machine negative little padding high price above the batteries included are an aspect not a little but the big controller placed inside the plush is in my opinion too exposed being there little padding you feel too hard plastic of course we then go to feel strongly the product even for a matter of safety before giving them to a newborn or a small child we must understand if it can hurt or not risk that it is excessive to say exist but more padded would have been better
4,very soft and very cute this plush has a serene and reassuring look perfect to keep you company and accompany the little ones towards sleep it is powered by fleece stylus included in the package that you go to insert in the big command placed inside the otter one thing i very welcome is the possibility to wash the plush in the washing machine having the possibility to remove easily and quickly the electric part placed inside through the internal command you can set all the functions of the plush from the type of sound emitted noise of nature white noise breath music melodies or heartbeat the volume of the sound effects the activation of the movement and lighting of the tummy once set to activate the plush will press the tummy and for about minutes will continue with the program set unfortunately there is a detector of tears that would make it really perfect making it automatically activate in case of night awakening the plush is still very nice and the combination of the many sounds make the most suitable
4,the otter is a very nice sleeping aid the music is very pleasant for my feeling much more relaxing than with similar articles the following things are striking the buttons for switching on are behind a velcro fastener when you open this one is very loud very sad that there is no other solution here zip remote control the music runs only minutes which i feel as something short if you want to turn on the music again it is very loud as described above here would be a timer of advantage which you can set yourself the motor for the abdominal movements is a bit loud with sensitive children this can certainly also be very annoying if you dont mind these aspects you will find a great sleeping aid for your child here
4,sweet otter which is still nice and cuddly even after washing the functions are varied and can be adjusted accordingly the light is a great night light not too bright the melody can be regulated in the volume and thus also great to fall asleep however i personally find the breathing simulation quite loud and the motor which lifts the otter breast and lowers very prominently but you can also simply switch off with the control unit the otter is quite heavy without but perfect for babies
4,the otter is really very cute original as seen on the picture very cuddly soft fur that is a little fussy the melody is very nice the volume can be controlled loud and quiet the heart palpitation noise also comes over very well and shows its effect both with the children and with the mother the function of the breathing otter is a nice idea but the meschanic sounds are very disturbing when moving the belly the module can be easily removed and inserted back by means of a velcro closure
4,the otter which got the name otto from our son is beautiful it is very fluffy the music is very nice and practical that you can adjust everything individually and adjust the music volume the only stupid is the volume of the engine while breathing thats louder than the music which is why we always turn it off but even without this function the cuddly toy is recommended
4,very cuddly and important noise options availablemoving the visit combined with the light is already very reassuringin addition breathe in and out as a noise optionunfortunately only find the engine a little too loud but thats my perception my little one doesnt realize it anyway and he likes it as a gift for newborns i find it more than suitable
4,the small slumber otter is really sweet it is very quiet about the noise setting the motor for the belly movement and the music can also be controlled well in the volume the shell on the belly is also provided with light which can also be switched off i am very happy also with the processing very soft fabric it could be slightly more fed but with some fabric in addition inside it is also solved the ecu inside is a little big but very easy made understand very soft keystroke no clapping would i recommend it because it simulates also heart tone and blood flow sounds like in the womb which certainly seems very soothing so then make yourself a picture of it out of points which someone needs a classification
4,i find it a bit hard to cuddle through the engine in the abdomen but the fur and the head are very soft and cuddly i find the engine quite loud what makes our little ones scare up is the velcro clasp on the back of the otter this one must always open to press the buttons quite loud a small zipper or push buttons would be better hereeverything in all however the otter is cute plays sleepy songs mimics heartbeat breathing and noise
4,my infant son wont sleep without me near i wanted something that might help him fall asleep without me this cute and soft otter is just what i was looking for i love that this has the rising and falling chest feature its the perfect thing to make him feel like hes falling asleep with me this also features soft pleasant music or white noise or snoring its really nice that you can choose which option you prefer as well as have control over how loud or soft the sounds are my only complaint is that all of the noise options seem to last longer than just the simple rise and fall and id rather my son not get used to having sounds in order to fall asleep that one complaint aside i also love that this is machine washable when you pull the remote out of the back and amazingly i find my older kids enjoying sitting and holding this otter too
4,a good purchase joli design and we want to sleep with even as an adult the plush looks soothing but i dont guarantee it works every time
4,very good concept but unfortunately my baby is more stimulating by otter than promoting sleep
4,very nice plushadvantages tuning of sound levels and soundsinconvenient motor noise that inflates the belly
4,sweet soothing baby excellent imitation of breathing heartbeat
4,for birth too cute
4,as always the fisher price has some really nice ideas and they are always well made the toys branded by themthis small soft and tender otter accompanies or naps of my daughter with delicate music or with the noise of the cadiac beat all selectable from a small panel controls placed behind the doll inside a tear that protects him from the laborful hands of the childrenonce selected what can please the children you can turn on and off through a big button hidden on the belly of the otter the thing devcero beautiful is the simulation of the breath and beautiful movement of the belly in addition light up in a soft and delicate wayso cheers my daughters naps that listening and watching him sleeps blessed a good help
4,my baby loves her
4,i wanted to test the white noises to help my daughter sleep during her naps months unfortunately she is absolutely not receptive the music on the other hand calms and she takes it in her arms to sleep
4,my grandson will fall asleep with pleasure and with gentleness when the father christmas will pass this gift to him i am seduced
4,the otter is cute and its breath is calming baby likes and we also when baby falls asleep
4,too cuteconform description easy to machine soft soft light adjustable music top
4,this product didnt work for my year old daughter i think i gave her too late but i find the concept great and perfect to help baby make her nights
4,nice nice soft
4,get our baby not to cry at bedtime the first day he cried a little alone and now nothing it seems that when he sees it he already relaxes he can put the music quite low and lasts minutes for now it is enough time for him to fall asleep and not wake up at the end the movement of the belly makes quite noise but does not seem to bother him
4,theyre really at peace with the otters he makes my son months sleep quickly its a pity that you have to use a lot of strength to push the heart down on your stomach then cracks very loudly so that he runs for minutes were to send it back but unfortunately theres only the money back instead of a new otter i know that if something is broken then you can exchange it soon something like that will only be bought in the store
4,it is a toy that we want to use since it is a baby because the songs are very tender and sweet it also has choice of heart beats or sounds from inside the utero it is pleasant to the touch but the apparatus inside is very large if it is not covered enough to be very soft
4,it costs my little one a lot to fall asleep and i bought it to try something elsethe sounds are great and they are heard very wellthe light is enough to not botherthe only stick that would put it is that the sound of the belly mechanism is heard a lot at night otherwise my daughter sleeps looking up and down the belly with the light on it is relaxing
4,for my fisher price is a brand of absolute confidence its products are safe for children my children have never managed to disarm any they also last for many years with their functions and appearance intactand also they are fun and entertaining for childrenfor those reasons i chose this toy as a gift for my granddaughterit is also a cute teddy better than what comes out in the photoi dont put stars because it hasnt given me time to check its durabilityi hope the brand hasnt lowered its quality like many other brands and we continue to enjoy its quality
4,it turns on by pressing the belly but to turn it off you have to open the velcro from behind and press two buttons at the same time which is somewhat uncomfortablealthough if you press the gut it also ends up turning off but in the instructions indicate that the way to turn it off is in the back buttons so i dont know if it will spoil it in the gutthe movement of the breath makes quite noisehowever the doll is very sweet and with the light low or off it is very relaxingthe sounds are very good and you can regulate the volume
4,hi friends amazon when you click the otter print of the belly you light a warm yellow light and your belly goes up and down it sounds a pianolike muse with some variations that are changed from the electronic unit that is inside the otter i had to open it from behind to get to the unit and there you find all its control buttons volume control music light and heart beats it works with batteries of the type aalr it is somewhat messy to be opening the otter whenever you want to change music or the rest of its parameters i would have preferred a remote control or that its buttons were on the outside that of opening the otter whenever i want to change something bores me a little the otter is great but its electronic unit ends boring you with time
4,it is a lovely companion of dreams we have loved many aspects of it the design is very tender the otter is a beautiful the presentation is also very pretty since the box simulates a cunita it is completely unisex it is very colorful for gift since the teddy comes to the eye and can even be tested since it has demonstration stacks on it in our case the whole set comes protected with a transparent plastic bag so that it does not get dirty before it is released the fabric is very soft and pleasant we love that you can very easily separate the teddyney from the mechanism to be able to wash it in the washing machine all the interactive stuffed animals should be like this pressing the tripita it lights up and puffs up as if you breathe calmly and paused the effect is very accomplished we can select very soft music nanas sounds of nature and white noise beats whispers it automatically turns off after minutes we can choose the intensity of our light and volume of the music and sounds we do not even make us look very good
4,it is not a bear it is an otter which i think is one of the most tender wild animals the box of the stuffed animal imitates a small crib the presentation could not be better from the beginning it invites to achucharlo the breathing effect is very realistic and it can be configured at different speeds the center of the tripita is illuminated with a yellow light and the rag tail comes with some prints of goldfish you have it available in
4,update after half a year the engine in the belly has slowed down the weak buzzing from the beginning is now as loud as a mix of toy drone and model plane and drowns out the quietest volume level very unpleasant fortunately i quickly found a replacement at the time it was sold out almost everywhere and because brains are a funny thing my now needs both otters to fall asleep one to anguck or scare someone with knatterknatterbrumbum and one to be cute and fall asleep and jaaaa strictly speaking im out of age but only quite strictly speaking the functions of the otter are quickly explained he plays music lights up and lifts and lowers his belly which is supposed to hug so half realisticly your and my breathing overall he plays eight tunes i believe many of them i dont know and were probably produced by fp itself the others are my bonny lies over the ocean mary a little lamb beautiful can relax and twin know how to beat the other songs if you dont do not want to play
4,the figure is cms tall and the coating is very soft it includes options of minutes of music and sound effects and lights to facilitate the babys sleep the sound volume is adjustable it works with batteries of type aa volts that are included manufacturing is chinese with good finishes and good quality given its sound options you have to try which one is most pleasing to the baby i think it is a good choice
4,doll to accompany the baby very soft with choice of music white or breathing noise light and movement included the mechanism is removed very easily for an adult allowing it to be washed or even used as a teddy simply
4,i dont give you the stars because of the weight and sound the system makes when breathing otherwise i have to say that my baby relaxes very much with breathing and music the light brings warmth to the softness of the otter that is beautiful
4,the fisherprice otter sleeping time baby baby baby nut toy and hairy newborn mattel fxc is great very soft teddy friendly that allows to make movements and sounds easy to use i do not give stars for the rough and noisy velcro if you want to access the inside of the teddy otherwise it is perfect
4,beautiful even if arrived with low batteries
4,good
4,we bought this cuddled otter on the occasion of the birth of our little girl our children my son and my beautiful daughter wanted to have it for christmas if possible but we preferred to offer it before and they are very happy with it
4,this product is qualitative but its price is also excessivecertainly the price of quality
4,small original and very soft plush with its small belly that lights up and inflatesa very cozy little doudou
4,meets all the criteria described in the product description truly cute and soft otter
4,adorable plush very soothingmelodie soft and long my monthold baby makes it work alonedamage that the batteries do not last long
4,hello i found this plush very interesting for my grandson but we press on the belly and she lights up and breathes only a few seconds
4,it was a very appreciated gift
4,my newborn daughter of months goes crazy has various functions from the tummy that lights up to the effect of the breath of the lullaby i really like that it is easily washable in the washing machine and it is really soft and cuddly as a play
4,fischer price doesnt miss a shotsafe and soft material great to calm my daughters if i find a defect is slightly heavy but otherwise it is fabulous
4,very good product a little big i like the adjustable side of each function damage there is missing a remote control
4,soothing puppy adopted immediately by my babypositive point really excessive battery consumption you must necessarily invest in rechargeable puppy
4,i like everything suitable for babies
4,very soft
4,its well thought out and for an ideal baby
4,it is a very nice and soft teddy ideal for a baby i liked everything especially the sounds and songs
4,tell you that this teddy is designed for babies up to about or months i tell you this because the device that controls the sound control unit is in the back and only prevents access to that place a velkro so it is not ideal for babies who already use their hands effectively but on the contrary for babies that mobility is scarce is a very good teddy since the sounds that they produce can calm the baby highlighting the sound of the mothers heart is really achieved the teddy is soft detachable and at the same time can be washed without any problem mattels teddyney is ideal to place it in the crib and calm the little one so that his rest is excellent of course say that the teddy bear is a nurse that is asleep my experience with this product has been positive
4,soft touch
4,i cant value it it was for a gift
4,i love it
4,a wonder
4,my baby has loved it the music relaxes him a lot although personally the light seems excessive to me breathing makes a little noise but soon only the music sounds
4,one of the biggest problems that we have when it comes to sleeping a baby is to calm down for it and one of the best solutions is music and if it goes with a soft teddy and it mimics human breathing then much better and thats what we have in this teddy in the form of an otter its very soft so it doesnt damage the babys skin it has music that relaxes it and it works by imitating the breathing so its especially thought for babies since its birth the teddyney is small and has up to eleven sensory functions in this way besides relaxing the baby it helps him to move more and better it helps him to develop the view and the touch and especially with the ears it has the possibility to program up to thirty minutes of music and in the area of the belly it carries a small soft light to entertain the baby more it works perfectly relax the baby and we are calmer it has a very good price and it is of great quality so i do advise it
4,not yet used in the long term but superb
4,good soft music product
4,nice plush the belly makes a can of noises during the movements
4,soon received soft and soothing
4,puppet really cute various functions including heartbeat breathing relaxing music beautiful the function of the tummy that moves as if breathing at the moment does not do the calming effect hoped for for my baby girl maybe she is too small having only months but i hope for the future
4,to put in the babys bed
4,for my grandson
4,its really nice and soft its useful to raise and lower the volume according to your needs and to be able to select the function that one prefers at the moment the only small defect is the fact that its a bit noisy the movement that reproduces the breathits a purchase that i recommend
4,cute and useful for the bed we use it x sleep it when the repertoire of lullaby runs out once asleep we leave it on in the cradle so as to limit the awakenings it turns off alone after a half houruse little the functions breath and light colors a little off from awake nn attract a lot x play
5,for my little girls arrival
5,soothes well and soft
5,very pleasant toy
5,for my little girl and thats great
5,i love it perfect for my new baby
5,very useful for sleeping baby
5,all right for a little baby in need of her mommy
5,too good
5,very nice little otter very soft and extremely well made
5,baby loves her
5,excellent toy
5,great product my daughters crazy about it i recommend it to you
5,adopts immediately by my baby
5,wonderful in all this otter soft even considering that it has a great deal inside beautiful music soft noises nice face and cuddle perfect
5,i loved this plush already from the photos and descriptions and when i received it confirmed my expectations i took it for my baby of months and when i never discovered it before the noises of the womb make him fall asleep practically immediately the melodies are really relaxing you can adjust the volume and it is not a trivial thing the tummy that moves is really nice to see you can program the function for example melody light or breath light that we want to make the baby listen and then just press the button on the belly and then goes on for min then turns off the only defect is that the buttons to change programming are behind and closed by a strap safer method for the baby but equally noisy if there was a small zip of those missing would be better for the rest the extra advice quality report great price
5,the sounds adjustable volume fortunately the light on the tummy and the slow but continuous movement of the breath relax the child so much so that he falls asleep even huggedit is not very soft at least not where there is the electronic part but it is not dangerous
5,this plush is gorgeous i bought it for my monthold to help him sleep alone actually the otter was literally kidnapped by my yearold son he fell in love with the belly that goes up and down and doesnt want to be without it anymore the otter is fantastic easy to wash even the music adjustments tummy light up and down are easy to set up im really happy with the purchase
5,a little expensive but my baby likes it to death it has several sounds and the light on the tummy helps to make her fall asleepalong with the rhythmic movement of the abdomen and the sound of the heart beating makes my baby fall asleep in no time recommended
5,the otter accompanies the dwarfs of my baby with its sweet melodies much prettier than those of the music box that i had bought her it is very soft and if you put the breath mode raises and lowers the belly the batteries with this mode are consumed at the speed of light though otherwise you can only put the music mode and set the volume the keys are behind the plush it is easy to wash just remove the envelope from the rigid inside through a zip
5,perfect relaxed very much my son of months it was a salvation especially to promote sleep and relieve a little the small problems of the teeth and colics before he slept only in his arms or anyway he had to feel my contact now i can relax because he relaxes also with this nice otter
5,beautiful product the only problem and that the puppet has little padding so you feel a lot the plastic of the internal machine despite that my year old adores it and sleeps hugged every night
5,i love it simply i bought it after seeing it in a shop i fell in love with it right away very soft and relaxing the sounds are lovely and the heart movement is simply divine
5,an unusual pet this otter is beautiful cute melodies light in the tummy and fantastic breath mode i bought it to put it near my month old baby when sleeps because he likes contact very much it didnt work but we love it when wake up only flaws the price a little high even if much lower than the store
5,i decided to test this plush to my grandson just three years old as soon as he saw it he was very happy and he exclaimed it was zia its very soft actually the plush is really soft to the touch and a real companion for the nights of our children the animal represented is a gray otter a toy animal that is able to help children play and also relax during the night and during the time they rest this otter is able to emit vibrations that calm and relax the child but also of music very sweet it is suitable for babies from months up lets say until years of age in any case even if the kids get bigger will remain his companion at night and play an aspect that struck me it was the fact of having used the sounds of nature to relax and calm the little ones and i have to say that they really work the sounds have a length of about halfhour our bright effects are also attractive in the aaa
5,article in line with my expectations
5,it works pretty well to sleep my bb it relaxes a lot besides q has variety of sounds the best is q you can regulate the volume i recommend it

5,great is a gift and its a soft and sweet teddy i think youll have a great time with him
5,a wonder my baby falls asleep in a matter of minutes with her has several ways to adapt to every moment breathing mode is a pass since it relaxes us so much that even we fall asleep hahahaja i think it is an essential purchase
5,they gave it to me when my baby was born and now ive bought it for a friend i like very much and relax the baby
5,i bought it as a gift for my nephew it is incredible it has a very soft touch breathes and with that it calms the baby very much it does not weigh just very light and can be given to the baby since birth
5,i loved the product the sound of the mothers belly heart enchants with the very appropriate product to relax your baby
5,my baby really likes it relaxes it the only thing i dont like is that it has to be opened to change the way but id still buy it again very good toy for a baby
5,i bought it to give away i didnt know that buying the newborn and the truth was right because the child had everything and this has loved the parents and the baby
5,since the first day my baby has loved this toy all of it music heart beat breathing etc everything relaxes him and gets him to fall asleep almost immediately when before it cost me a lot i certainly recommend it
5,very soft i thought i wouldnt listen to the baby until after a few months but caught his attention from the beginning
5,a suitable game for babies of a few months siave and with warm melodies for the baby to relax and sleep i love that it is an otter and imitation of breathing the best that can be washed
5,fulfill what he says even though our baby doesnt pay much attention to him doesnt have two months yetlets hope that in a few weeks they wont part
5,magnificent there are many musical stuffed animals to accompany the babies in the dreambut like this otter none ideal the heart beat optionit has many options and being able to moderate the donation is very comfortable depends the moment relax or sleep of the baby
5,the breath that he does is the most and with the relaxing music look that i put things to my baby of a month and nothing calms him it has been to put the teddy near the body and calms and stays until asleep i love it
5,it is a teddy that recreates an otter to relax and accompany babies in their sleep that is not always easy super soft and pleasant to the touch has a light in the belly and charity relaxing melodies that work it understands breathing heart beats relaxing music and above the central part moves like real breathing it is very accomplished and really has conciliatory effects of sleep it is not magic art but it is true that it encourages its rest and with it ours musical tones its can regular and it is totally serene nothing excessive recommended it is certainly something expensive to be a teddyney but it is worth trying if the baby gives bad nights if it solves it or reduces it for little it will have been worth it it can be washed in the washing machine taking out for it the electronic component of its interior do not forget
5,very soft teddy otter although if you squeeze the body you notice the box with the mechanism it seems to me a very sweet toy you squeeze his belly and it starts to sound a very soft and pleasant music in addition to a small light that is lit in his navel and best of all the doll starts to breathe and that relaxes a lot besides the noise of the mechanism looks like the purling of a kitten it is an ideal doll to give to a newborn although i think it can use any child a little older at bedtime because it accompanies and many times they are afraid of the darkness the presentation has very much liked the box imitates a cunita in which is the nurse sleeping belly up
5,my baby has it totally hypnotized it is a baby otter of the softest it is quite big and achuchable the feeling of breathing added to the childrens melodies is ultra relaxing even for my haha i think this toy is going to be a success to me and my baby has us in love it has several buttons in the back to control the level of volume light and the options of melodies sounds beats nature breathing and the mechanism of breathing of the tripita this last point in my case is giving me problems you listen a lot the motor thing that is not relaxing anything in the video i have put the melody to the low volume so that the noise that makes is heard on the other side i stop working the motor and at the time it works again but it seems that it jumps the breath and makes a small noise when i jump if it happens to you it can also happen that it is a bad part of series and not an isolated defect in any case you will not have problem in amazon to solve it quickly nor do i understand very simple button because you sometimes i dont even make a lot of melodies melodies melodies very short and i am
5,we are looking at a toy for the little ones to use when sleeping in the crib it is an ideal teddy for newborn babies as it performs breathing movements that will help babies to learn as well as to relax thanks to this teddy the little ones will be able to encourage both the sight the ear and the touch we will be able to customize the music we want as well as the light intensity up to minutes the teddy fabric is very soft and has no small pieces so without any doubt it is an excellent gift for any baby who has just been born the current price is around euros given the brand the quality and the polyvalence it seems a really recommendable purchase in short an ideal teddyney to start encouraging the little ones help them to sleep and learn to breathe an excellent purchase
5,a teddy very pleasant to the touch and to the ear since its melodies are not like those of the whole life strident but they are pleasant to listen to the effect breathing is very good because while vibrating the teddy goes inchanting the belly creating a sensation that the little one finds pleasant and relaxing the volume is adjustable as well as whether or not to turn on the little lights andor to turn on or not the effect breathing a very soft companion of naps for our little ones the price seems high but if we compare with others of worse quality and similar price is resolved the question of whether it is expensive or not a product highly recommended the little one will love
5,it is beautiful and very complete the hair is very soft it has the appropriate size and shape to put it on one side of the cradle next to the newborn it has different types of music and relaxing sounds that we can choose together with the lights and the movement of the belly the going up and down of this next to the noise that mimics the breath are very accomplished all this can be selected by means of buttons hidden in the back by means of velcro it works by means of aa batteries on the other hand the mechanism is easily removed so that we can wash the part of the clothin addition if we want to give it away the presentation is careful because the otter is lying in a box that simulates a crib and remains very cute
5,fisherprice toy never tested before and unknown to us at home the model is an otter i have checked it before giving it to my son and it does not present cutting parts nor pieces that can be released and our children swallow them very important thing it is of a very soft touch it is washable both by hand and machine the size is the right it is unisex is valid for boy or girl we can take the electronic part of the part that is not without problems the batteries carry their safety screws that will make our children unable to pull them out it emits sounds it makes as if you are sleeping the belly moves we can illuminate it the belly or not and above all helps our baby relax and make you sleep
5,today almost for any medium quality teddy we pay what is worth this teddy that even more the touch of the skin is very soft it is seen that they have taken into account that it is for babies because you do not expect me neither the seams that simulate the eyes neither the mouth nor the nose you have certain parts in cloth how they can be the soles of the feet to the bottom of the tail but the seams are well done that is not appreciated the sound is a tone that does not turn out strident there is a feeling of relaxation besides the dim light that comes out of the navel does the times of light for fear of the darkness we have tried it with a baby that is barely months old when you put your brother and one of teddyney next has been curious when we have activated it we have not noticed any kind of fear and soon they were both lying next to each other the truth is that seeing the result is worth the price that is worth it
5,a very tender teddy that any baby will love and will be his companion in the evenings it transmits a lot of tenderness and will be perfect to camp him the first months of life the doll has light and music besides movement that mimics the breath it is very pleasant touch also you can wash it by removing the electric mechanism it has a timer of minutes and you can control the volume something that is very appreciated in these toys since not all can control the volume and in some cases it is very high the movement of the breath sure that hypnotic i think it is a perfect gift greetings
5,the otter is super pretty with its tender and sympathetic face it feels like hugging at first sight it is soft and mullidite perfect candidate for first teddy friend for any babyit may seem expensive at first moment but its price is justified laa otter is not only a simple teddy with music to entertain like many others if it has several different songs which can be played for up to minutes also being able to regulate the volumebut the main difference of this teddy with others is that it can also emit breathing sounds at the same time that its cuddly goes up and down at the same pace with a soft yellow light that gradually weakens and finally goes outfor a baby the otter serves as a calmer and vehicle to fall asleepit works with four batteries which are already includedthe ted bear can be easily washed previously by removing the mechanism of its interior
5,content teddy with the shape of baby otter with light sound and movement the mechanism of it can be removed completely batteries included aa pros four sound options what the baby hears in the uterus heart beat snoring and white noise type hair dryer fan or vacuum cleaner childrens melodays type nanas up to minutes regulator of volume and intensity of light smooth soothing light in the belly of the otter that also goes up and down as if breathing the mechanism in full can be removed from the teddyney in this way can be washed without problem smooth fabrics of quality with a very careful finish style included at least to try the product ideal to become the babys dreammate from birth until it is born until it is stopped from needing either two years or seven in that strange stage of night fears and need to be in contact with mompa until it falls asleep contras it is a little big for a newborn but this is a simple inconvenience
5,it is easy to use as we have seen that the batteries can be changed quickly and easily without any danger for the baby quality fisherprice does not failour nephew is now weeks old and we have always had trouble to make him sleep he arrived teddy in the morning and we tried it at noon and we are delighted after minutes where he was fighting against himself because he did not want to sleep he had lost the fight heh and in the evening he blabs briefly but sleeps in minutes high recommended as a gift to newborns and for your own baby fantastic and monisimo soft to no more
5,we have a similar cuddly friend of the much more expensive variant i have to say that our otter is simply awesome clean soothing tones even the mama sleeps well with it moving the belly up and down is fascinating and soothing too alike the weak light in the belly of the otter is wonderful all in all a great invention of fisher price and highly recommended
5,weve already tested some musical clocks this is in our opinion the best very many functions the volume is super good to regulate pleasant sounds and melodies it is not necessary to pull up with a band but the otter is activated by pressing on the belly we bought for both children and are enthusiastic absolute purchase recommendation
5,the otter is really very sweet and fluffy we always use it in the evening as part of our sleeping ritual with the aim to fall asleep at some point without breastfeeding my son is now months and likes to cuddle with him the volume control is very good the melodies very pleasant we currently use mainly the sound as in the womb
5,the delivery was fast and it is easy to use as we have seen batteries can be changed quickly and easilyour son is now weeks old we always had difficulty getting him to sleep we got the stuffed animal in the morning and tried out at noon and are thrilled after min where he himself was fighting because he did not want to sleep he had lost the fight and also in the evening he blabs briefly but fell asleep within min
5,without this cute little animal our child can no longer fall asleepthe long playing time is advantageous because you dont have to activate the music clock all the time parents also sleep quickly a good sound quality definitely worth their money
5,so our son got his otter with months and immediately grinned he gets him during the day as a sleepmate and then draws him affectionately towards himself although it was still quite difficult for him he also lifted up to cuddle with him of course it is dangerous to let him sleep with it unattended at the age danger of suddenly child death but this is well known for all cuddly animals blankets and pillows the music is now after a month still not annoying but still really sweet however breathing is a tick too loud for me but does not bother at all when falling asleep because it is regular i just dont find it nice the staggered switch it off i find great first breathing then light then music also that the volume can be regulated is great because it is quite meh on his head many toys for babies are dangerously loud here no longer in fact he does not get any more at night we had it taken away after falling asleep anyway first because he doesnt sleep with it again
5,excellent product
5,its beautiful my baby seems to like it a lot i love it
5,its very delicate special for a baby
5,this little otter is quite a love its small in size has very soft hair its nice to touch it and you dont notice the seams its quite well achieved the truth it has different musquitas and sounds which can be regulated both in time and volume it has a little light that is also soft and not bothersome as for the result it does relax the baby and leave him well asleep weve also tried it with a year old girl and even if shes older she loved it and fell asleep with her in her bed it works
5,the otter teddy is very well thought out i have a device that helps them to sleep but it is not the same this one being teddy shape and being so soft babies can interact with it and put it close to sleep with it it has different sounds breathing beats white noises and soft melodies that sound for half an hour in a row the volume can be adjusted but the high tone is not excessive also one thing that relaxes them is that it is swollen and unsinks the belly imitating the breath the fabric can be removed and washed in washing machine without problem i am very happy with this product it is very well thought out
5,it is a teddy with a very soft and soft fabric which can be machinewashed extracting all the machinery when you touch the padded belly a light is lit and starts to make breathing movements simulating the presence of someone while a melody sounds personalization includes the variation of the volume turn on or off the light of the belly choose between music or preset sounds that are white noise heart beats sounds of nature and snoring we can also choose that the belly simules or not breathing and all this is selected with buttons that are in the back and that are then hidden with a velcro closure it is a very nice doll and for the moment seems to have liked the baby
5,this is a teddy doll shaped like an otter from fisher price i say it is a teddy type because it is soft and very soft but it has an interior device for lights sounds and movement that make it a hair harder than a teddy one and that weighs a little bit more in the middle of the belly it has a dim light and also emits up to minutes of relaxing music now what i found more beautiful is that the belly of the otter makes a move as if it were breathing it is adorable i find it a beautiful doll for a baby i gave it to the baby of some friends and loved it and the truth that the baby stays very calm when they put it on
5,i tried playing clocks and two other sleeping aids for my baby before and was never convinced that they would simply stop too fast or are too loud or bad in sound im excited about the otter the volume can be adjusted the music plays thirty minutes and the light pulsates pleasantly in addition the otter is designed with attention to detailmy little one fell asleep during the first attemptif it takes longer times you just have to press on the stomach and the last setting is repeatedone criticism point the light goes out after minutes which irritates him if he doesnt sleep yet
5,we could have used this otter much earlier it is the best sleep aid for our daughter months old so far and not to think away the music plays for a long time and has a pleasant tempo not like most playing clocks so that the mouse has enough time to fall asleep we also like to use the breathing noise especially at night when it gets a bit restless the otter can be restarted by a slight pressure on the belly the engine noise only when breathing movement which is often mentioned here i also feel rather calm monotonous unfortunately the engine for the breathing movement after only month failed because the batteries were not strong enough we have now inserted ordinary batteries and everything works again thumbs high absolute purchase recommendation only the price could be a little cheaper
5,very sweet otter with lots of beautiful songs to fall asleep the songs are played beautifully slowly and calmingly not in the fast pace of other musical clocks in addition the other sounds such as snoringheart noise vessel noise like the ctg and the light function in addition very sweet as the belly rises and lowers when breathing all functions can be displayed separately as it pleases the child or adult also nice that the volume can be adjusted and the otter without inner can be washed absolutely you dont have to have it but my little one and i are happy about it every day he doesnt fall asleep yet but the music calms him nice and if he isnt tired he is happy about the light the music and the breathing movement clear purchase recommendation for all those still looking for a smart music watch or a nice gift for a baby
5,i learned about the slumber otter through placed advertisements on the internet seen and immediately in love one can say at this point due to the good reviews here and of course also the infatuation we decided to order the slumber otter what should i say from the infatuation has become love such a wonderful and highquality product which can do so much and seems absolutely relaxing even on adults this cuddly toy is really worth its price even if my daughter will not be born until december i already know that she will love her otter
5,we bought the slumber otter for our month old daughter after the introduction of the evening breis she is no longer breastfed this made it more difficult for her to fall asleep and i often had to carry her around until she fell asleep the otter visibly helps her to relax she smiles at him and croaks him she does not fall asleep faster but much more gently by means of itwe have convinced the product quality the sound is clear and the volume control is great it is very easy to operate he then plays minutes of music or sounds the pulsating light and the breathing movements turn off automatically already after minutes the motor for the breathing movement is heard already but it looks very sweet for me this is more like a gimmick at the older children but the musicroofs and the gentle light are really very soothing
5,i was skeptical at first but then he was recommended to me so often that i let myself be carried away what should i say never without although my baby only comes in a few weeks nevertheless i already use the otter a lot and like it the melodies are super pleasant and soothing and i put this otter to the heart of every growing mom who from time to time is also restless or loses herself too often in her thoughts the heartbeat and the breathing i have muted that was a bit suspicious to me the light on the other hand is extremely beautiful and gets brighter and darker again and again i love it
5,im thrilled due to our upcoming second offspring we have long thought and researched what we could buy to make our baby sleep the little animal arrived quickly as usual from amazon unpacked and tested the various functions are absolutely sufficient to bring a small child and an adult to sleep the function that the belly moves and light breath sounds are generated is absolutely ingenious my wife and my daughter love the little animal and i must confess that it fully fulfils its purpose we will have to get a second one because i fear that my wife will not give the first one any more there is a very clear purchase recommendation thick stars
5,i got the otter at the beginning of january for my daughter who was month old at that time now she is months old she was a writer and only let herself be calmed by white noise at the beginning i was not so excited about the otter because he was too quiet for my daughter he did not come to scream against her we had to use a cell phone app since she is about months old however the otter is in permanent use we always use the functions noise and light every time she wakes up at night i turn on him the very small light source helps me to quiet sleep in the family bed and silently lying down and it helps her to fall asleep again she wakes up very often in the night sometimes every minutes so the otter is in some nights in the dauerbeinsatz of the only manko the otter runs exactly minutes but then goes out and exactly at the moment she wakes up because the noise stopped and at the time in the sleep cycle she has arrived again at light sleep therefore she doesnt always wait until she wake up the otter
5,otti is so sweethas helped to fall asleep super everyone immediately got into ottijust goldenit is definitely worth his moneyi would buy again and again
5,we give it to some friends who have had a baby specifically it is months old since we gave it to them you can not separate from it especially to sleep emit sounds that relax you very much and you fall asleep right away
5,its beautiful super cute
5,its for a gift and i havent used it with the baby yet but i turned it on and the movement simulates breathing pretty well if it works for me to hold more in the cradle ill comment
5,well this purchase now looks good the doll inflates and deflates and my son thinks that we are the ones lying next to him it works good idea for children who just want arms
5,purchased for baby gift quality in materials and can cause instant sleep in adults the girl has not yet given me her feedback but everything indicates that she liked it good purchase
5,since i saw this little hair i fell in love our baby has not yet been born but i am sure he will love it as it has many sounds including that of the mothers womb heartvery good quality it can be washed without problem by removing the mechanism inside
5,my son loves it hes his super friend comes with us everywhere you can regulate the volume that at night doesnt hear you the whole neighborhood im sure that will help us a lot in the transit from the crib to the big one
5,the otter is soft it breathes it imitates the sound of the beating of the heart it has music and light all this with selfturning off it worked perfect for two days to sleep our daughter but no longer works although it is not the fault of the product
5,good quality it works perfectlyawaiting to try it with the babysuper soft
5,ideal gift for parents who have recently had a peque touch is incredibly soft and its sound movement and light help at least in my case to fall asleep when the baby wakes up at night especially useful from the age of months when in some cases like mine there is a change in the babys sleep pattern
5,i liked it very much it has several options if you want to put them together or separatelymy son liked it very much for saying something bad has a very large sailboat behind and if you want to open it to change any option can the baby wake up
5,its great we love it its great that i have so many different sounds my daughter sleeps right away with the nannyes and touching her belly its been a good idea to buy it
5,the melodies in this model are really tender and calming not a glaring flicker as with other musical clocks which even partially woke up the child if you set the breath movement to go along the mechanics are a bit noisy it crunches and buzzes a little but fortunately that is separately adjustableeven if you want to change the volume of the melody you have to open the velcro closure on the back of the otter which is of course very loud however i find it very practical that you can remove the technique and wash the plush animalthe light in the belly of the otter always becomes a bit brighter and darker not flickering way but with completely liquid transitions this looks great and soothes my little daughter months even at night so she looks at the light very calmly and fascinated i recommend this article to all becoming parents also as a gift definitely a good choice so that you do something good for her child
5,a well thoughtout fischer price product can be used from birth and certainly already soothing to put it still pregnant mom on the belly very pleasant soothing music and the movements of the little otter lead even small explorers gently into the land of dreams the light and music unit can be removed without any problems and then you can wash the otter in the washing machine
5,i can only recommend it used for minute and our twin sons have slept directly the otter is so sweet i am in love directly could be used directly without switching on or using battery in the otter the volume can be regulated music plays belly lifts and lowers a small nightlight turn on in the form of a heart and it can play four more sounds heartbeatatemwhite noise and a sound that is known to every mommy similar to a ctg during pregnancy yes our boys have slept within a minute the only thing that might be improved in the up and down movement of the belly is the meshanick to listen relatively loud
5,the slumber otter is a really great product music box and cuddly toy in one it is in use with us daily and so far we have no problems with it the motor to lift and lower the belly is of course heard when it runs but it is definitely not too loud also the sleeping melodies are very nice also as a gift really recommended
5,my son loves his sleep otti the melodies and sounds are very nice and soothing especially ottis snoring sounds are very cute the light has a beautiful and attractive luminosity the breathing movements also have a special attraction to make any new settings you have to open a velcro fastener on ottis back each time and press various buttons which are however well represented however it is very positive that you can simply press ottis belly if you want to start it again with the same settings the engine noises for the breathing movements are indeed quite loud and clear to hear but it doesnt bother us either compared to similar products i find the price for this completely in order schlammer otti looks super cute and certainly makes itself a great gift
5,when our son was only a few weeks old the otter didnt do anythingnow our son is almost months old and the otter is our rescue he likes him totally calms down quickly when you turn on the otter and then even falls asleepso it should be it is a relief for him and for us when he has a quenching phase and is too restless to sleepthe sounds and the music dont bother me personally i can also fall asleep all in all the otter would buy again
5,our otter arrived today much faster than indicated it is totally cute super fluffy and makes a good impression qualitatively the melodies and sounds are very clear and not bleachy or scratchy really pleasant to listen to the engine for breathing is as i dont find at all too loud as it is described in some reviews you hear it very easily but i dont feel it annoying what i also think is great is that you can adjust the otter individually tunes or sounds breathing on or off light on or off several volumes there are quite a lot of possibilities and i think there is something for every baby for me there is a single minus point for my taste the otter should like to be a little louder for which one should use the quietest level it does not entirely open to me because then you can hardly hear anything but that is also just a small downside i would recommend the otter to everyone whose baby needs some help to fall asleep is surely also a very great gift for birth since it can be used from day on
5,we love this sweet otter my little one sleeps very badly and finds it hard to get into deep sleep the otter does not help to fall asleep but sleeps again when she falls asleep in the stroller we turn on it when we are at home and she sleeps much more quietly and does not wake up immediately i find it particularly great that you can adjust the volume it is intuitive and easy to operate and all functions can be operated individually mostly we only have the sweet snoring on sometimes quiet music to calm down if she has it in her arm already breathing but here actually disturbs the noise of the engine the advantage to the music clock is that the otter is much quieter and plays for half an hour ging also with the mobile phone but first of all i need my mobile phone myself we are very happy
5,great productit has a super touch aroused and my monthold baby loves it and helps him sleepit has relaxing sounds different melodies a dim light and the belly moves it providing you with the peace of mind you need to sleepthe bad thing is that to change the sound you have to open the velcro and select it by hand which makes it a little cumbersomefor my baby and for us stars
5,the product came to me defective the music stopped in a few seconds i talked to the seller and did the replacement at the moment i recommend the product since i have a baby that resists to sleep and with this otter relaxes between the relaxing songs that it brings and the breath that it simulates i recommend the seller has responded very quickly
5,the product is good for my son who is not even two months old it usually costs him to sleep and i thought about this stuffed animal because it has colic and with the sound of the heart it falls asleep since it must remind him when it was inside me and with the music it relaxes the only drawback is that to change it you have to open it and it makes noise i leave it open so you dont have to move it much otherwise it is fine he still doesnt realize what it is but i hope that then he plays with itnow that i have tried it a few days the batteries dont last anything
5,my daughter loves the noise of the heart beating and stays fried
5,it is beautiful soft and original with the tummy that lights up and goes up and down as if breathing it has sounds the typical music and the one that mimics the heartbeat and the breath and has a very nice packaging to give away besides it washes very well
5,the best gift we could give our baby until three months he suffered from colic and has been his cot to date he sleeps caressing him at night we put the melody together with the light of the tripita that goes up and down and sometimes the function of the heartbeat i think it will be his teddy for yearslike everything is improveable the manufacturer would suggest that the engine inside the teddy of all functions be reduced and so the teddy was soft and manageable i fear that as soon as the baby grows and can manipulate it we will have to remove it because it is very heavy and in that case we will fill it with foam but our bebe is feliz with its otter so highly recommended as a gift
5,my daughter is delighted and at last it seems that we get her to sleep alone with her otter friend she is two years oldthe teddy is very soft the musics are nice and in a short tone perfect to help relax to me relax hahahahashe has a light also soft that is enough to not stay in the dark but she doesnt see much to get out of bedthe tummy makes a move to go up and down that definitely hypnotizes and that also helps her relaxit has been a successful purchaseat first it seemed a little expensive but we like it very much and the main thing is helping the little girl fall asleep alone
5,spectacular our baby of almost months who has always had a hard time falling asleep loves and relaxes so much the sound of breathing is the one we like the most along with the light and movement of tummy it has become an essential for the time to go to sleep
5,above all i liked how smooth it is and the fact that it can be separated from the washing device unbelievable error but today there are still toys for babies that cannot be washed so a great point in their favor and more in the situation we are living you fall in the street and if you can not wash maybe you think until you throw it away sthe device is like a controller you can see it in the photos you have options for almost everything a pity is true i have read in other comments that asked to record the voice and no it does not include that option although for my part i do not consider it essentialin general i am very happy with the otter the only defect i see it is that the babies take everything to the face and the velcro that closes the back is very rough and rigid i think that another type of velcro or a zipper would have been better option still i recommend it i am sure that even if it stops working it will remain one of their favorite stuffed animals
5,this perfect works great and my baby loves it
5,the slumber otter was bought as a gift for a baby party the parents were very happy about this unique gift we are also glad that we did not decide for one of the many pinterest ideas windling places etc because this was too high we have still decorated the otter with sweets and a congratulations card for quiet eveningsnights for all those who also need a gift they should access here
5,i was only skeptical because my daughter only fell asleep for months while still and cuddly animals hardly pays attention thought also that the light could rather disturb than help when falling asleep well i was taught a better one at christmas i gave it away we had nothing to lose and now it has become a ritual to turn on the otter in the evening and the light is pleasantly soft warm and becomes in the rhythm of the breath brighter and darker the breathing noise hears it most simply hammer selection of melodies is top volume control top quality top and batteries were also present the only thing you can complain about for example if you want to switch from the breathing noise to music you have to do this manually ie the velcro closure at the back sticks bombproof because good quality and then open and close again however it is still great because you can wash the otter also after the inner life has been removed but if you listen to the same thing as we do every evening you simply press the belly and the otter is on or turn off again
5,a great gadget even in pregnancy i like to put the otters on my stomach and the small belly dweller reacts to the melody he has some melodies and also a noise or sweet snoring on offer i find handling a bit more difficult because you have to open your back to change volume or mode nevertheless a nice companion and i am happy when our baby is in the world fast shipping get on primeday cheaper
5,very nice music box it looks like on the picture i dont know if the batteries were there anymore i find it very sweet also from the volume i find it good even my son who was at the time years old thought it was great and wanted to have one too i can recommend this otter very much because it is exactly as described
5,the first impression is that the little face looks a bit cheaper than expected but the breathing function and the light are really nice and you dont find anywhere else the motor for the movement is a bit loud but due to its monotony will have a similar calming effect as the rest of the sounds the musicnoise are all pleasant and the operation easy conclusion for home sweet i wouldnt give it away rather because it doesnt look very good
5,we took him out of the box and closed him right into our heart everything went very quickly as usual amazon delivered quickly we packed the little otter quickly put the batteries in and off it went my daughter years closed him right into the heart and my wife and i too now the little one called otter by all of us is simply a part of the family sounds music and the glow of his heart can be controlled well by an integrated control unit this is well integrated into the otter so that the little one cant take you out so quickly the batteries keep with us for several months during daily use the otter is washable according to the instructions and is very soft and pleasant we feel the music is beautiful and soothing if my daughter and i want to make a midday sleep our otter is always with us our daughter loves him and we dont give him any more thats my opinion of one of the best inventions for which we can not fall asleep well want to relax and make a beautiful babys sleep for all our children and make it a lovely babys sleep
5,super cute and the heartbeat function has a very soothing effect on my child my midwife was somewhat skeptical about the function of imitation of the maternal heartbeat with regard to breathing she was concerned that just newborns could stop breathing by the memory of the time in the womb so far we have not been able to observe this
5,this little otter should be for my weekold son well wrong thought the yearold has stifled himself at once and for a long time not left out of his hands so as you can see it is for every age class as soon as i come into the living room the beautiful melody sounds which is very pleasant because it is very gentle and quiet i find the details of the little otter very golden it was washed even without problems and quickly again attached to the sound box i am completely satisfied and would always recommend it
5,this otter convinced even my very sceptical husband immediately he helped my daughter straight away the otter was a very strong recommendation from my friend who uses it with her son and he immediately falls asleep but it not only helps my baby to fall asleep but even calms me down it is always minutes first the abdominal movement goes out after minutes and then after another minutes the pleasant light followed after another minutes of the set noisereal class we would buy it again and again and give it to fresh parents
5,we are super satisfied with the otter not only does it look cute but the noises also come very well with my little one the light is not too bright and the breath movement is even even though it is not very natural however we only use the sounds because my little one doesnt care about the other functions nevertheless i find that the otter has earned five stars the volume can be easily adjusted that it is not too loud if you are looking for a nice gift no matter whether girl or young i am sure that it always comes well
5,the plush animal in itself is very nice and well processed cuddly and neutral in the smell the technique consists of a block of hard plastic in which everything is installed personally i find that the device is not soft enough embedded in the stuffed animal so you notice the hard one very clearly but my wife finds it great especially to bring our weeks young daughter to sleep
5,to the otter super sweet cuddly toy the belly is the onoff switch individually you can also adjust volume music heart tone abdominal movement and light at the back of the device the device can be taken from the otter so it can also be washed for me a very clear purchase recommendation certainly also arrives very well as a gift for freshly baked parents i would have been very happy about it
5,the slumber otter was from grandma and grandpa a christmas gift to our sonloudness is absolutely ok for babies to fall asleep and also the different modis leave no wish open and keep the offspring in moodthe size of the otter is also absolutely sufficient for a baby and also really cuddly is the otterdefinitely recommended as the first sleep cuddly help
5,super sweet sleeping aid for babies pleasant melody and the light and the sound of the heartbeat is very soothing much better than a music box especially since it goes out on its own after about minutes perfectafter half a year there were problems and the otters didnt work anymore got free replacement so everything perfect didnt even have to send it back nice seller would i buy again and again
5,like myself the otter was given for our still unborn daughter but i always put it on her stomach and play the music before her thats great about it that i can regulate the volume and the whole thing is finished after minutes by itselfto this there are several functions of noises etc which certainly have a very relaxing effect for a babyi am very excited about him and he seems very reassuringmy niece was so excited about this when visiting that the aunt did not miss it to fulfill her desire for her own otter at christmas and this is no longer to think away from her she only sleeps with him
5,our month old son loves the otter he plays different melodies snorting and breathing sounds heartbeat as well as white noise in addition the belly cover moves and shines which can be switched off or switched on especially the white noise is very popular here in case of restlessness or to fall asleepthe volume can be regulated wonderfully and is absolutely sufficient the electronics can be easily removed to clean the otter besides the otter is also really cute to look at we would definitely buy it again
5,so our little one calms down very well with otti at first she didnt fall asleep but was distracted almost the whole time or inspected him more closely meanwhile she also falls asleep with him and keeps her hand on the moving belly between time and time againcan otti only recommend of course the motor is a bit clunky but doesnt really bother the engine is running very quietly so far despite frequent use all in one was a good investment
5,very sweet and soft
5,this is so sweet and my baby absolutely loves it really happy with this
5,so many options otter helps baby sleep with a breathing option never seen anything like it helps work on natural senses of touch sound and sight very soft material very cool for modern parents
5,although this was larger than expected this little snuggle buddy is amazing this soothes my baby so well the belly breathing is amazingly soothing for my newborn i will be buying one for my niece who is due next moth this will make an excellent shower gift
5,oh my this is simply adorable it simulates soft noises like baby would hear in the womb the animal breathes deeply and his tummy rises and falls while hes deep asleep and you hear the sweet noises soothes baby wonderful shower present
5,my lo has had trouble sleeping in his own crip since he was born i never thought i would be able to transition him easily however this otter is the perfect transitioning tool he watched his belly move up and down as he falls asleep and stays asleep all night i highly recommend this
5,i just might have slept with it since my husband doesnt allow live pets in our bed but she loves it and im teaching her that she can only have it at bedtime that way she has something she loves to help her sleep and help her it does when shes tired all it takes is about five minutes of her listening or feeling the otter breathe and shes asleep this comes highly recommended
5,this is a nice soothing sound machinestuffed animal there are buttons inside the back under the velcro the options are for its breathing motion a light on its tummy music or sound after you make the selection you simply press its stomach and it will do them all but for each a separate amount of time it will do minutes of music sounds minutes of breathing motion and minutes of the light the nice thing about this is the otter is machine washable you just take the electronic unit out
5,my lo loves this little otter she cuddles up with it and squeezes it she seems to be soothed by the sounds and the breathing motion i was nervous she might have found this scary because something things that move make her cry but this guy didnt my lo just turned a year and i can foresee her using this for at least another year if not longer
5,i was very surprised when we received this to see that the otter breathes just like it would in real life while it is playing music or one of the sounds that it plays my daughter loves sleeping with this in her pack n play and feeling it takes breaths and the music is the perfect volume so it isnt too loud or soft and it helps to soothe her to sleep it also has a little light in its stomach which is great too because it is very soft and not meant to wake up your little one i am so very happy with this toy and so is my daughter great item to have to help your little one sleep in their own safe space and still think that someone is next to them
5,fisherprices good night luv loubout is a super cute super soft super awesome little stuffed toy for babies place the little otter in the crib next to your little one and press play the little otter will lure your baby to sleep as its soft belly lifts and lowers in rhythm the otter also plays music and lights for up to minutes summary musical otter soother with breathing motion for babies engage your babys senses of sight hearing and touch mimics the rhythmic motion of your breathing to naturally soothe your baby customizable up to mins of music sounds and soft lights super soft fabrics machinewashable with electronics removed
5,i am in complete shock at the overall greatness of this product it is so cute super soft and just the right size for an infantmy daughter still has minor colic and ever since i got this toy for her she has been falling asleep and staying asleep much quicker and longer the breathing feature along with the heartbeat sound gives her just enough comfort to doze off without everyone constantly having to hold herthe lullabies keep her dozed off and the little comfort light lets me know how everything is going i wish i would have had this toy months ago this will be my new goto shower gift
5,this little thing is such a great gift for expecting moms its sizeable enough that it wont get lost its soft and fuzzy and the heartbeat is lovely honestly my yearold wanted to keep it forever and ever and was super disappointed when i said we were giving it to a friend however said friend is a close one so she gets to play with it regularly anyway the batteries last a reasonable amount of time the sound isnt too loud and it really is comforting because it lays flat it can be put either in the crib or on a shelf right above it with no issues the light isnt super bright either but its just enough that in the darkness of the room you have a pleasant glow that wont kill your eyeballs if you walk in from another dark room in the middle of the nightoverall this really was a great gift and if i knew anyone having a little one id be happy to give this again
5,first off this is seriously the most adorable little thing ive ever seen its also so so soft and cuddly i would be lying if i said that i didnt think of testing it out myself before giving it to my daughter outside of the apparent aesthetic appeal who can deny the cuteness of an otter of this little otter the features are amazing with the breathing motion of the otter tummy rising and falling i thought that it may feel too mechanical however that was not the case i love the fact that you can utilize lights sound and motion and customize based on what features best work with your kiddo win here you can remove the mechanical piece to throw the otter body into the washing machine this would make a great gift for a baby shower or for a new parent update now that my daughter has had this for awhile i can happily say she loves her otter it is in bed with her every single night in the morning before she is fully awake i have caught her pressing the tummy to turn on the sound and lights and laying by her new little friend calmly definitely a win
5,hello and good evening we have the otter now about weeks and i have to say im thrilled the volume is adjustable it makes music heart tones and much more due to the adjustable volume you can control the noise level this disturbed me to the normal mobiles arg because the meanwhile are so loud that you can hardly talk normally i can not think it away at all our small mouse months sleeps every evening with it and is totally relaxed the best thing is that you can remove the electrical part from the middle and thus wash the otter super therefore at any time a recommendation value and i would give it away also every time i hope i could help with this review have fun with the little friend
5,great gift for future parents i have already ordered several times for young children with friends and family and was always one of the best gifts and investmentsthe noise level is fine the smooth movement of the belly calms the baby and the otter conveys a situation similar to that in the mothers belly it serves as a sleep aid for babies and calms it at the same timeone of my favorites presents on the one hand it makes a lot of visuals and on the other hand the functionality is also exciting and highly recommended
5,i cant believe it since paul the otter moved in mausilein can fall asleep and sleep aloneshe was not a delete child and needed mom or dad to sleep either on his arm or next to both it works completely without us and even the pacifier spits it out beforefirst of all ours is so demanding that the otter is meaningless wrongly thoughti can recommend the otter to anyone
5,would the part buy again and again and find it very well suited as a gift it plays several melodies and simulates breathing and heart sounds my little one also often presses the part in sleep and does not want to miss it anymore the heart also gives off some light so that when she wakes up it is not pitch dark in the room
5,our son is already year old and just as long we use the otti already during the evening ritual to fall asleep we like above all the pleasant music not too intrusive not too loud or shrill simply relaxing to fall asleep we only use the light for some time which is also very nice not too bright very warm light which alternately becomes brighter and darker again all in all a great music box
5,my niece year loves the slumber otter he goes to bed with her and sometimes she also plays with him alone she can turn him on and off herself i gave him to her because she often got very quenchy at lunchtime with otti this works better now you can adjust different melodies and sounds his belly lifts and lowers i give him more often because he is not only sweet but really helps to fall asleep and so relieves everyone a little bit and he always gets very good
5,i bought this sleeping aid from fisher price because we also have the old version in the form of a penguin now years old and still worksthis otter is really sweet he has a very good choice of music my son years old doesnt want to fall asleep without him anymore even the movements of the belly are quiet and with the turn on of the light children no longer have any fear in the darka second otter was already worried for my niece because the enthusiasm of the parents is also great
5,not only does this slumber otter look very neat it also has great settings to support the babys sleepwith its various settings you can let yourself be soaked by the soft sounds follow the heartbeat and breath sounds or just turn on a small light when baby is afraid in the darkhe is firmly anchored in bed and is one of our evening and sleep rituals
5,i was skeptical at first but the otter is now part of our sleep routinewe exhibited the breathing but the rest is just greatthe somewhat clumsy body doesnt bother us since the otter until now does not serve as a cuddle
5,super invention my son months old sleeps much faster and better and the otter is also taken to cuddle can i really recommend if the child has problems with falling asleep does so even with my daughter years which sometimes has real difficulties falling asleep so is also something for older children conclusion i would buy it again every time and is also a great gift for freshly baked parents also suitable for fruits because there is the function where you can only turn on the heartbeat is then almost like in mamas belly
5,the greatest thing we have ever boughtmy baby months and i sleep so well with the beautiful music very relaxing and very nice slumbersi only hope he lasts very long and doesnt break so fastthe heartbeat and the breathing movements are also good so far the money has always been worth it
5,we fell in love with this little otter already at the beginning of the pregnancy on black friday the little one was ordered and arrived a short time later the music is very pleasant the breathing certainly calms for the child and overall makes this toy a great impression it was also important to us that the toy is washable if something goes wrong and that is also possible here wonderful
5,really great partthe otter is very well processed in quality the sounds dont sound tinkering and the operation is very easythe melodies on it are actually very soothing and my baby sleeps very well i can definitely recommend the otter it also makes itself very good as a gift
5,we have been looking for a suitable music box for a very long time with my son we had such a sleep bear with heart and noise sounds years ago this was really terriblehe was terribly loud and the sounds were more indefinable crackedafter a long search and reading through all the recessions we decided for this one and we are all super enthusiastic my son years also finds it great the melodies are beautiful and the heart tones sound at least also to heart the volume is adjustable the light goes on or off and the breathing of the otter is also switchable on or off all in all a super great sweet cuddly animal that is definitely soon loved and needed intimately
5,the slumber otter was a gift for my month young nephew it is totally soothing comes to rest and can fall asleep better through the gentle melodies even the bigger sister who also comes to rest faster the otter has already become a sleeping ritual for the two
5,our ottie is very popular it is already taken here over all she wants to sleep with my mouse sleeps since the quieter and i can push her away after the good night silently without crying she sleeps with her ottie nice on with us the ottie sniffs the function is great because my husband and also i are snoring or breathing in the sleep sound so i can get up again in the evening he is very fluffy alas if he could be even more upholstered since the machine is still quite hard when you get it to the head xdthat the belly moves still as if it really breathes is very soothing cheap batteries keep up with full function nights i find that is a very high power consumption
5,but tonight as if he had guessed what to get for christmas there was no way to go to sleep so the christmas present was preferred and the otter unpacked i thought it was very good that it could go off right away and not first had to be filled with batteries every mom dad knows it the baby screams it has to go quickly the otter arrived at the otter the little one accepted it very well of course he found the light very great it didnt take two minutes and he slept and small tip on the edge with dad it also works great
5,the otter itself is worth its money our little one loves it from the first day on the melodies are soothing and the volume can be adjusted perfectly slowly our little ones eyes fall too while he listens and looks dreamy on the small night light on the bellybut also with adults
5,a very nice mobile she takes this better than the baby phonelike mobile the music is nice relaxing and sounds great we havent tried everything else that way yet the plush is probably what she likes i like the extra light also that it goes out before the music goes out it was worth the price
5,the little otter is magical it imitates sounds from the womb such as the mothers heartbeat or the noise like in the amniotic fluid it also makes breathing sounds and the music is very pleasant and soothing you can also adjust the volume a sweet gift
5,at first i was hesitant about getting this because i thought it was weird and creepy but after seeing other reviews and hearing from people who swear by it i decided to give it a chance im so glad i did its surprisingly very soft and cuddly even with the big electronic contraption inside its so convenient that i can just take the electronics out and throw it in the wash and it comes out just as soft as before i love the colors and the little fish detail fabric on the tail super cute the belly movement is still a little off putting to me but it really did soothe our newborn i appreciate all the different sound options and that the belly can be a little night light we dont use this every time baby sleeps because we dont want our little one becoming dependent on something but every now and then when we do use it for calming baby its been a life saver it makes for a great onthego noise machine as well for our trips to grandmas house we call ours otto
5,was a baby shower gift
5,calms our baby down
5,perfect my daughter her love
5,it is very cute
5,my little guy just loves this
5,love it
5,have not tried it yet as it is a xmas gift
5,very cute great sound options
5,perfect for my baby cute an cuddly for relaxing an bed time
5,great product my nephew loves it
5,month old loves it
5,priceperformance top the slumber otter has several functions that can be combined with each other light music very pleasant volume breathe heartbeat belly rhythmically up and down move the otter runs minutes and then goes out highly recommended my year old daughter loves him
5,we have great pleasure with the otter the heart tones sound like in the moms belly and have a calming effect on my daughter super also that the volume can be adjusted individually my daughters got the otter with weeks now it is weeks and starts to look at the light and grabwe are absolutely satisfied and i am sure that with increasing age the other functions with joy will come to use which also totally inspires me that you can take the music part inside out quite easily and the otters can give so in the washing machineabsolutely recommend further and especially useful for newborns
5,mega sweet very nice for big and small the melody from the tone is really top there are so many bad music clocks but this otter just sounds great of the quality also the songs that are played are very soothing
5,otterchen has been in use since the st day after being released from the hospital and also several times the battery stops and stops however we only use sound and light if our little one weng times we do the white noise there are no sound differences at the moment and therefore otterchen deserves an absolute purchase recommendation the light could possibly still tolerate a color changer but i am enthusiastic about the sound as well as the other functions
5,we love him my little one has had him since she was months and we cant think him away anymore he helps her very much to fall asleeplittle down the engine is quite noisy when you turn on the function where the abdominal wall rises and lowers as this is very annoying we dont use it all other noises and settings are separately adjustable and adjustable
5,totally sweet we all love our mr otter super sleep help for our daughter months and cat to fall asleep we always take the melodies find it only very bad that the otter automatically ends after only minutes our daughter wakes up during her midday sleep
5,so something of sweet and fluffy i love him lamp lights up briefly and moves his belly while breathing he purrs briefly and plays beautiful soft melodies couldnt test him yet because i packed him as a gift but what i saw heard and felt is top would i buy again
5,my first newborn will love this an awesome idea for the little ones
5,my little grandson loves to cuddle
5,baby loves it falls asleep immediately
5,i like the price
5,too cute got for my new granddaughter
5,baby loves it
5,it is so sweet and irresistible
5,this is adorable
5,it was an otter which made it original and it was so soft n cuddly it was purchased for a baby shower gift an it was a hit with everyone we all loved it i highly recommend it
5,absolutely love this little critter its super soft and baby loves it worth every penny and its adorable
5,gave for a shower gift
5,umbeding buy worth every cent make the otter always on when i lay down my little one months he sleeps suoer with the otter even me he calms down volume can also be regulated the breathing movement are also dear the music very pleasant min always the breath with music dan minutes only music without light
5,the slumber otter is not to be thought away anymore it was immediately super accepted and i find the music as well as the sounds very soothing and pleasant wouldnt have expected it to arrive so well with us since we also have other musical clocks but somehow it radiates calmness
5,i was skeptical at first but our little son thinks its great the volume can be super regulated what spoke for me very much for the beaver was that you can take it completely apart to wash the fabric when its dirty
5,my children love him first of all i bought the otter for my year old son because it took him a long time to fall asleep and was constantly awake at night but also my daughter years and also i can sleep great with the sounds i use the mothers body noises the music box and the other functions i do not use due to the adjustable volume you can adjust the sounds individually my son cuddles with the otter and falls asleep in a few minutes when he wakes up at night i press the otter only briefly and my son falls asleep quickly again new batteries last relatively long approx month only criticism with older children the breath function does not work if the otter is held sideways in the arm or the arm is placed over the belly of the otter therefore i have completely disabled the function as the otter would otherwise constantly shut off
5,so my son is months old and he likes the otter due to the volume control it is optimal to adjust different functions enrich the whole still like eg noises like from the womb calm the light and breathing of the otter i am thrilled it has been very pleasant top gift
5,the otter is really a great gift for the little ones among us due to the different tones and melodies a good sleep help what also has to be said in case of problems the seller is really very friendly and tries to help as soon as possible or to exchange the toy to send again really top
5,my baby loves him and is now tighter to fall asleepi dont want to think him away anymorei also had problems with the electronics after about weeks but it turned out that this starts a safe sign is to replace the batteries
5,my daughter is totally on the otter however after months of intensive use he has a problem the engine for the belly no longer works and the hum of the engine is hardly overhearable and almost overcomes the loudest attitude of the music levelwhen i bought this little guy at the time i paid almost i have to say honestly for the short life is to me in hindsight but i would have expected that he will last longer
5,my little one sleeps very well with it he looks cute is half well upholstered and that would definitely be better he can be washed what was very important to me and after a short period of frustration when the breathing was no longer in and let it be turned off now everything works fine again
5,just recommended and not to think away from our household anymore our son got the otter at just under months at christmas since he is plagued by colics a somewhat restless child we tried a lot to create calm since we have the otter it works great he tries to crawl into it formally in it is so sweet only disturbing point are they perceptible engine noises while lifting and lowering the chest the little one obviously doesnt mind we use it exclusively during the day when the little one is under observation at night i see the danger that he could suffocate because he is really pressing his face on the otter
5,our son likes the otter very much i like very much how many possibilities there areunfortunately that he is sold out here again and again and is partly at shameless prices in it i was lucky
5,i bought one for my granddaughter she already had one but he stays in the daycare center and now i bought one for home really a cute u great part it deserves stars
5,very sweet we brought this for our daughter volume adjustment is very easy to adjust via the opening of the back easy to wash that you can completely remove the electronics
5,great product this gift arrived really well the cuddly toy and the cover are soft you can take it off for washing sounds movement and light work perfectly and actually look very soothing
5,i think its good to be able to play music or the heartbeat a set how loud or quiet you want it to be whether the light should be on the belly or whether the belly should move up and down i can only recommend it
5,find the otter great sinked a bit in the beginning but that was quickly gone once washed and everything great our little one loves to fall asleep especially the breath function is great
5,we just love this otter sooo very much my little one always sleeps with him and has him also always close to him
5,we cant be without slumber otti anymore hes no big guarantee that our lit will fall asleep immediately when you turn it on but he calms it down immensely he listens we have heart or breath sounds running looks at the light and the moving belly and comes down really well
5,my baby months got the otter from us at christmas and closed right into the heart the many functions will certainly accompany the little man even into the toddlers age personally i find that the quietest step could be a little quieter but thats also a matter of feeling
5,it works and thats all that matters the otter was bought for the month old baby for birth but the big brother at years has torn the otter under the nail he sleeps deeply and firmly with it thus the mother has more time for the baby what it takes we assume at the moment that if the big one doesnt need it anymore the otter passes to the next one otherwise we just get a second one clear purchase recommendation
5,i can only recommend this otter its not only sweet but also practicalour daughter calms down with the music especially when the dad is no longer on parental leave the mom can make herself a meal or the laundry or other important things of course i am happy when my baby sleeps on me but it doesnt work all day super invention thanks for the relief
5,my baby months loves the otterlie and i also the otter has become our go to bed ritual volume is adjustable music and also the three sounds heart knocking water noises wind are also adjustable and very pleasanti dont want to miss otterlie anymore and would buy it again and again
5,great music box great melodies with timerthe mechanical sounds in breath mode disturb me a bit as a music box however great to recommendthe fabric is really very soft and the music box inside does not disturb
5,was very skeptical if such a cuddly animal can really help my expectations were more than exceeded my son months sleeps since he has the otter totally calm and relaxed and also at night he helps so that my son finds his sleep faster until now my son never slept more than half an hour then he was awake again and thanks to his otter he just makes his first nap alone in bed and that for hours already
5,you can choose all functions individually or togetherthe sounds of the moving belly sound like slight snoring or breathing sounds not disturbing at allwe have the otter now for month and would buy it again and again
5,the otter is so sweet it was just the perfect gift that i could make for my babythe many different functions seem a bit much and confusing at first but you learn to deal with them quickly
5,super cute otter that our daughter months old got at christmas the sound effects are good but we prefer the one from my hummy all in all i would order it again immediately super cute cuddly toy also suitable for bigger children because it is very big
5,such a sweet music box i put myself on early in my pregnancy and i hope my little one will like him even if she is in the world at the moment i always let the music run to sleep and it is totally reassuring
5,we bought otter for our twins months on saturday the moved in with us and we love them all even my year old is thrilled she also gets one more loudness perfect light flickers something and invites you to dream different tones eg melody hears twin heartbeat twin the sound quality is excellent playing time of min optimal he is everything in all the best times other music clock i know only to recommend
5,we bought the little otti for our adoptive uncle and can only recommend the cuddly friend to everyone so sweet and to fall in love the sound is very harmonious and the different settings are perfect also that you can adjust loud and quiet is totally great have not regretted it so far but could possibly be a little cheaper nevertheless i would buy it again
5,the toy looks sugary and supports the parents with all kinds of functions when giving away the father felt the breathing movement as creepy but i and the baby loved everything
5,very cute item perfect for a newborn however thought it couldve been priced a little cheaper
5,perfect for baby to hold when trying to get them to sleep love this
5,great toy
5,such a cute baby toy put my nephew to sleep within minutes i say thats a win
5,i love it its really coming
5,beautiful lve the soothing sounds and stomach up and down
5,my month old loves bedtime with mr sea otter the breathing setting always makes him fall asleep
5,great item for my new grandson he was a preemie and he loves it
5,worth every penny
5,used for our year old son who has trouble falling asleep on his own comforting and soft helped ease the transition from mom or dad laying with him until he falls asleep
5,granddaughter loves it
5,super cute little otter i dont think it helped my daughter sleep any better but she loves him

5,my children love this easy to change settings very cuddly head my year old is always telling me to snuggle it to my face has helped the baby fall asleep better in his crib by providing gentle noise and light
5,i got this for my mo old niece she loves it so much that my sister and her husband have already had to replace the batteries mama otter as they call it makes it easier for her to fall asleep and makes it easier for my sister to feel comfortable leaving her daughter with her grandparents
5,after our sons last sleep buddy gave out on us i searched for something similar and this is the closest i found he seems to enjoy it it definitely has a mechanical sound when the breathing feature is engaged but it doesnt bother us at all
5,she absolutely adores him at a year old she cant push his light button on her own but she knows where its at and loves watching him breath and play music super soft and cuddly
5,i was wondering if it can soothe my baby girls tension before sleep so i play the music and found my baby fall asleep quickly when hearing the music the volume can be adjusted easily and i can switch o white noise mode from the buttons on the otters back although the price is kind of higher than my budget it works great and is so cute that my baby and i feel joyful when the otter is playing music
5,this otter really does breath its a little hard but overall quality is great the music it plays is soothing and plays for a long time so you dont have to get up every five minutes to turn it back on it has a little glow light on its belly and my month old seems to love it definitely too big for a newborn month old but worth it to sleep train your baby
5,my month old really started fighting bedtime recently i decided to get this over the glow warm or bs soothing animals and im glad i did this does so much and you can control what is played as well as the volume it runs for a good amount of time too its helped me and my little guy when its comes to bedtime has even put my boyfriend to sleep we love this adorable little sea otter id completely recommend this
5,excellent quality baby soother its soft and light just the right size snuggle buddy for my month old the volume is perfect not too loud and the quality of sound is smooth and soothing i just love it its so cute and it does its job well
5,i bought this as a baby present i had to play with it a little before i gave it away though its so soft and such a cute little otter the music is soft and comforting the button in the tummy lights up with a soft glow and it breathes such a cute concept
5,im totally excited looks very cute and a great fall fold of noise settings
5,looks nice only the engine is a bit louder but that doesnt bother for some children this is also a soothing sound its nice that the light is not on continuously but is dimmed again and again and goes out after a few minutes but the music continues
5,super great giftthe best is that you can also wash the cuddly toy
5,the best sleep aid our week old daughter sleeps wonderfully with her otter she cuddles at him and listens to the white noise until she falls asleep within a very short timesuper is that you can control the volume
5,we have ordered the otter for our twins it has various functionsfor us it is worth gold because our son sleeps with the otter much easier
5,the otter is a miracle medicine for our little ones it only takes a few minutes for us to fall asleep
5,just nice feel good i find the noise pleasant the real hardening test how does the child find it follows in a few months
5,we bought the otter for our little grandchild months she sleeps better one by the otter you can set it very quietly that i find great and it is super processed and the best you can wash it because the battery compartment can be taken out
5,we use this as the sound machine for our newborn and its amazing as a professional musician myself i recognize all the songs that are being played and i love how most of the songs are classical themed music the breathing setting helps calm him down and if he does happen to wake up the glow of the stomach will distract him and he will fall back asleep this was a great purchase it is well worth itthe otter itself is soft and the different fabric on the ears is really silky i highly recommend this if youre thinking about purchasing it as a gift for somebody or for your own baby
5,my month old loves this otter almost as much as i do the lullabies and breathing motions are perfect and soothing
5,the otter is so cute and is very soft however its not as snuggly as you might think i understand there needs to be hard parts to make the otter work the top is soft though and my month old loves it since we bought it he sleeps a lot better i would definitely recommend it
5,its like a snuggle buddy i practice infant safe sleeping but before putting my son to bed i turn on the otter i will put lullabies on the white noise or sometimes the heartbeat my infant son likes to be held to go to sleep which sometimes can take awhile as a single mother who had to work in the am that is sometimes difficult but by placing the otter next to him with his pack he starts to get sleepy and then i can eventually move him to his bassinet and let momma get some sleep the quality is great better than ive seen on the other products like this i will be recommending this to other new moms
5,this is a baby shower gift for my soon to be born great grand baby so cute cuddly and has a heart beat breathing and minutes of lullabies couldnt be more pleased
5,i love this little otter its adorable soft and the sound machine in it is great it has a lot of configuration options and our month old likes it i usually leave it on the womb sounds while she naps which helps her to sleep in my opinion better the sound goes for about minutes which is great
5,omg this thing is so cute i bought it as a gift for someone and they loved it my daughter wasnt pleased when she discovered it wasnt for her i may need to buy another based on the cute factor alone
5,very to recommend fast shipping top product at any time gladly again

5,super it is madness everything in the description is fulfilled
5,a bit pricey but this was the only thing that helped put our baby to sleep for the first few weeks after he was home
5,my son loves his otter he started using it at a week old and is weeks now we use it every night it soothes him right down he loves music and it has a very calming melody we can easily take it wherever we go its very soft love the breathing feature and that you can remove the otter part and throw it into the wash weve had a few close calls so thats a bonus
5,i bought this for my yo who struggles with nightmares but after unboxing it i feel like i should buy one for each of my three kids and one for myself it is unbelievably soothing and soft and quiet and adorable it actually kind of feels like im holding a sleeping baby otter the light is very soft as is the music volume and pacing so calming definitely good for not just babies
5,a little expensive but my yr old daughter loves it it helped with her separation anxiety at this stage when going to bed i like that you can choose which features are played together you can have it breath with light on breath with light off dont breath but play music with light on etc etc totally customizable in that sense
5,this is a very sweet gift to comfort little ones i had never seen the soothe and snuggle otter before but i bought it off of a baby registry and it is very very cute it plays soundsmusic it has a soft light and it even has a breathing motion which makes his belly move up and down it also has controls which let you decide what you want on or off the recipient loves itnote for safety reasons do not leave it in the crib with the baby unattended and when the baby is sleeping it should be removed from the crib altogether
5,i purchased this late one sleepless night while i tried to get her sleep on her own in her bed she didnt take to it until she was about months old but now its must have she loves it shell gently touched the breathing stomach and lay there watching the glowing fade in and out she likes the music best what i love all the options theres heartbeat swooshing sounds music and you can control the loudness too you could have no light on or no breathing if you wanted its fantastic the only complaint i have is that if she pushes on the tummy or cuddles it too hard it turns off so until she learns to push it back onwell thats up to mommy and daddy overall though highly recommend
5,our newborn loves this otter she watches it until she falls asleep and if we dont turn it on she will make a sound to let us know she wants it on she has slept great with this otter she prefers the white noise option with the light and breathing motion i would recommend this soother to anyone we are contemplating buying a second one just in case something were to happen to the one we have
5,so i saw this and then decided to buy it this toy soothes your newborn and sometimes it provides the feeling of someone sleeping next to me baby it plays music has a heartbeat feature and it has this little fan my newborn likes or does not know it exists all i know is that he sleeps good and longer with it not bad for the money
5,this little cutie is super soft and has a lot of functions i thought it would be a hard toy since it does the fake breathing and would feel more like a robot toy but its actually soft and airy the breathing sound and womb sounds are my babies favorite so far i would definitely recommend this
5,very fast delivery and very good quality
5,the little one likes super is very soft and cute clear purchase recommendation
5,the little otter likes its a gift for the little newborn
5,we find the otter superonly the motor for the movements appears somewhat loud depending on the volume of the music

5,the only downside is that you have to open the velcro fastener at the back to change something a little loud when the child is already dunking
5,one of the best investments our little mouse can relax and fall asleep with the otter
5,attention could contain traces of german translation and selfmockery oh my god this is the cutest soother of my toy collection and it is huge im a german toy collector and allthough im blind i immedeately fell in love with this otter youtube and technology makes it possible i just had to have it unfortunately it didnt last long to tell you the truth not even a year later and the motor is wornout so strong that it sounds like a mixture of a chainsaw and a drone not really soothing and no joke i couldnt find it anywhere online or in stores but here the otter arrived earlier as planned and now it is guarded like the apple of my eye and yes i know that im actually a grown woman but hey think positive it doesnt just help babies drifting off to dreamland anyway i have to leave and sit myself in the garden to enjoy this calming music again and again and again and snore okay all jokes aside i hope my grammar is not too bad

5,probably the most useful toy we bought for the babies it calms and help the baby falling sleep among several sound effects you would find the one you baby love the sound quality is also very calming and it doesnt sound cheap the light effect is also soothing
5,my little one goes to sleep listening to the little otter singing breathing etc i like it alot and so does my son i recommend it
5,absolutely irresistible when it comes to cuteness great quality from fisher price a reliable brand
5,best thing we ever bought have purchased two one for home and the other for daycare a safe friend for baby to sleep with when they start sleeping on their own sounds are great and our daughter turns the light on on the otters belly to find her soother at night she sleeps hours straight
5,we love this night light everything about it is adjustableoptional music on or off light on or off movement on or off and volume level and you can choose any combination of all of them plus the electrical unit is completely removable so that the otter can be washed
5,my kid sleep with this every day i only wish it played for longer than minutes at a time i have to sneak into the nursery to restart it if i want my daughter to remain sleeping
5,my son loves this toy we have had it as his night time music since his birth and take it with us when we go anywhere the sound volume can be adjusted and the fabric is washable one of my go to toys for friends with newborn babies
5,this is a great product i love the unique breathing motion it has and the different sound options this has definitely helps us with a baby who loves to be held while sleeping my favourite setting is the breathing motion along with the fan sound for some white noise i highly recommend
5,i bought this for my little guy when he started his month sleep regression it was a bit of a long shot but i was desperate wow it really helped he seems to find it really soothing i put on the white noise function and the tummy risingfalling which he loves months later and its an integral part of his bedtime routine the light is very soft not a disturbance at all highly recommend
5,amazing within weeks of using this my baby started sleeping by herself she used to cry as soon as you put her down the breathing and noise option work wonders she loves it the only bad thing is the button to turn it on is right on the front so i have to turn it away from her or shell turn it off

5,cute and good to fall asleep
5,the small otter is immediately closed into the heart it has such a nice design and is cuddly despite electronics you can remove the inner life with cotton wool and you already have a normal stuff animal the otter has various functions such as breathing noises the cleanest snoring in the world sleeping melodies finally quiet sounds and no hectic playing clockclimbing or simply noise if you lift the breathing movement activated and lowers the belly unfortunately not quite noisefree on the belly is also a small lamp built in which lights up during activity very nice i particularly like that the volume can be adjusted depending on need everything can be switched separately and with a slight pressure on the belly started or stopped there is also an automatic shutoff after a certain time which i find very practical it is definitely a great companion for the very small ones and certainly also later positive optics function design neutral electronics engine noise negative
5,efficacy
5,totally beautiful
5,for my baby
5,im so excited
5,all great
5,we love him
5,totally cute
5,really helps
5,our grandson loves it
5,visually so sweet the otter
5,babies and small children need closeness and security but since parents cant always lie with the child for hours this little otter is just the right thing otti is super soft and cuddly other cuddly animals can certainly do that but otti moves when he breathes in addition he can calm the child with beautiful melodies however the sounds are particularly familiar to the baby otti can play a baby heart tone but also that of mommy or he makes typical breathing sounds also a pleasant light can let otti shine in his belly all this calms the child and it sleeps quickly and well the ideal little friend and also a great gift to young parents
5,our little one was already able to calm down as an infant from the baby noise app but a mobile phone is probably not the right sleeper for a baby the otter can play various soothing sounds or falling asleep music the volume can be individually adjusted optionally it moves his bellies up and down which shines as desired the slumber otter is super soft does not smell like plastic and is the perfect sleeping companion to this end it is genderneutrally designed and is delivered into his own small bed even if it is only about the packaging the idea to melt there is our little one loves to sleep in with his new friend and even forgets his pacifier from time to time everyone who is looking for a music box will not regret this purchase
5,i gave it to her and since then i havent got it back she cuddles him every morning and takes him to bed every night the music sounds and movements are ideal for falling asleep even if she didnt turn him on in bed hes lying so wrong with her thats enough for her the otter is very well processed and really very cute i think its a great gift hes super cuddly and fluffy im thrilled and my daughter loves him
5,in fact i fall asleep like a baby when the otter makes his cute breath sounds in bed next to me the plush animal not only looks heartlike it also offers many possibilities to make the falling asleep sounds according to my own preferences music breath sounds two different types of heartbeat white noise which actually sounds more like a vacuum cleaner with or without light or breathing movements everything can be adjusted by pressing a button when the otter is opened at the back of the velcro closure the electronics can also be completely removed to wash the otter in the machine if necessary only when closing it has to be taken care not to accidentally press one of the buttons otherwise the desired attitude is gone again personally however the engine noise when lifting and lowering the belly is less disturbing to me than the fact that the breathing noises if activated are not synchronous to the movements
5,the daughter of my boss has just become a mom so i ordered this music box for her the fur is pleasantly soft and odorless previous washing was indestructible electronic out washing electronics in folds great the songs are pleasantly lulling the lifting and lowering of the belly feel babies safe as pleasantconclusion mama satisfied baby peeked at the beginning still spartan but has accepted the music box and sleeps well with it
5,the bad otter from fisherprice is the perfect companion for our baby and a perfect cuddly toy for our baby someone has thought about it and studied babies great from the front a soft cuddly toy with great functions that can be adjusted from behind solid body differently with the melodies several different songs sound one after the other and especially in a pleasant way of sound the light function is muted and also the rehearsed noise from the mothers womb calms our baby absolute purchase recommendation our little one loves it
5,it is rated fisherprice fxc slommer otter music box made of plush soothing music light and breathing movements sleeping aid for babies from birth delivery perfect days before my niece was born very practical you can remove the electronics inside and wash the part i recommend everyone with newborn ones otherwise the otter is a great companion for babies you can play different volumes and music pieces also the belly glows and moves great gift and i can only recommend
5,the little otter slumbers with the baby or toddler and it can be programmed by mom or dad in such a way that a pressure on the paw print on the belly suffices and the program runs off you have the choice between melodies or natural sounds or no noise light or no light breathing movements or not and can combine everything as you like the volume can also be regulated the control element for setting is accessible via a velcro closure on the back for the laundry of the otter now and then you can take out this unit and use it again later thats well explained in the instructions for use you just have to look for a little bit because all steps are described in languages and these are among them that could certainly have been better marked eg with a country shortcut in front of every text the paws of the otter are sewn to his chest also i find this a little bit of shame i personally would have liked a velcro closure better the processing is perfect and the material of high quality the plush is super softly sweet but it is also amazingly effectively calms you
5,the little otter is delivered in its cardboard bed it is made of fluffy soft material but rather we look like a teddy otter is usually narrower built the inner life of the otter consists of the actual music box the otter cover can be removed and also washed on the back there is the opening which is secured with a velcro closure it is operated with v aa batteries which are already in place in the device inner life of the otter if you look at this music box more closely you can find back buttons for volume control a button for minute playing of soothing music the second button serves to select the piece nature background noise snoring or heartbeat the third button starts a minute movement the belly of the otter and another button allows the light to shine for minutes which is shimmering through the small belly all settings can be set out miraculously by pressing the corresponding button a user manual in numerous languages is included conclusion i like this soft sweet otter provides a good touch for the baby
5,the slommer otter music box by fisherprice is halfopen packed in a cardboard box so it looks like the cuddly animal is lying in a cradle nice design included in the delivery are aa batteries through which the music box is operated the product is clean unoccupied and does not secrete any odors the otter combines some functions it is cuddly toy music box light you can set music heartbeat and sleep sounds among others lighting and movement the keys to adjust are to be operated on the music box itself for which you open the velcro at the back of the otter the little otter appeals it is cuddly has a friendly face and a pleasant size the music box is removable from the inside so that the otter itself can be washed in the machine an aspect that is important in my opinion for small children the product is certainly suitable as a gift
5,the otter looks simply cuddly it has a friendly face is soft and fluffy and can become the first plush friend for every baby it is quite expensive almost forty euros but the price is quite justified the otter is not only a simple musical clock that you raise and then always comes the same melody it has several different melodies on offer which can play up to minutes the volume can be regulated in addition the otter gives breath sounds of itself on request the chest of the stuffed animal lifts and lowers and also the heartbeat can be made audible on the belly of the otter a soft yellowish light shines which gradually becomes weaker and then runs out for a baby the otter therefore looks really real and has a calming effect when falling asleep the four batteries required are included the cover of the otter can be washed without intments so without electronics well in the machine i find this plush animal very cute and absolutely suitable for babies as sleeping companions
5,we have ordered this slumber otter from fisherprice for our nd child we were still looking for a music box and have definitely found it with this otter what we noticed first it is so fluffy and soft that even our big ones liked it very much it also looks really cute it is operated with aa batteries the otter has different melodies that it can play you can further adjust whether the baby sounds like a heartbeat which should hear calm breathing while sleeping or hair dryer noises the volume is also adjustable which i like very much because you have a predetermined volume for most of the playing clocks you can also adjust at the operating unit whether the otter should glow in the middle and whether it should imitate breathing movements the operating unit can be easily removed at the back by the velcro closure and thus the otter wash small in addition according to the label you should wash it at low temperature and supposedly even in the dryer at low temperature you can dry it however i would like to throw it into the dryer for safety therefore i cant wash it very clearly
5,the slumbery otter comes with batteries so you can start right awayit looks very sweet and i look very pleasantly soft despite the electronics generally very well processed volume can be adjusted the different functions can be combined the speaker is very pleasant no too high tones and also no scratches the motor is heard during the belly movements but not as bad as i think if the motor encounters too high resistance then everything goes out and it stopsyou can also switch it off completely in the packaging it is attached with a cord and a plastic part which is removed with a degree rotation if you put the plastic part back in again sounds are short to hear and then the buttons are without functioni like the slumber otter very well melody and sounds are pleasant and soothing the g√∂sse also fits very well and the condition very simply
5,very good
5,purchased this for my baby girl at weeks and it has been an absolute god send my little girl loves it and happily falls asleep to the soft music and lights and sounds an absolute must have for all babies
5,my nephew loves this
5,lovely gift for new grandson
5,my month old grandson absolutely loves his otter
5,this is a lovely gift my great great niece loves it thank you
5,bought this as a present and its so cute breathing mode is amazing worth buying
5,my great grandson loved it and wont go to bed without it
5,lovely product with an amazing selection of music and sounds except the breathing one which sounded a bit creepy grandson loved it and fell asleep peacefully every night with his tiny fist touching the others tummy adorable gift for any child
5,bought this for my nephew for christmas and he loves it really happy
5,this toy is absolutely gorgeous bought as a gift and the new babies parents were absolutely thrilled with it
5,sends my son in law straight to sleep the baby takes a little longer i understand
5,my granddaughter loves the best and she sleeps with it and comforts her
5,i bought this otter all mimi for my newborn in the end its my monthold daughter who stole it shes not going to sleep without her blanket her doudo and her otter the little bemol of this otter its only that it works with batteries so you have to change these at regular intervals everything depends on the frequency of use of the device we just changed the batteries of ours so it lasted about two months the otter can emit a number of distinct noises small snoring heart noises white noises uterus noise etc you can only choose one type of noise at a time its necessary to do this open the back of the otter its not excessively laborious but its not an operation that youre going to perform every minutes either the belly of the otter can lighten up to act as a watchmaker its an enormous problem its enough to open up the back of the otter its not enough to make up the otter its not enough to make up the otter its not enough to make up the otter its not to make up the otter its not enough to make up the otter to make up the otter to make sure otters not to keep the otters not to make itt the otter its an opt to make its an opt its an opt to make sure opt for ointt ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot ot
5,so cuteevery soft beautiful size to hold in the arms or be next to baby there are several possible combinations with the buttons light music breathing movement sounds plus two volume buttons about levels of soundexcellent purchase we dont regret it
5,you will be thanked by the full wonder of your childs face at the moment of discovering his plush she is really cracking this plush my yearold son has made a huge hug to him as soon as he has had it in his hands i too the breathing mechanism is extremely well made it is very soothing the light emanating from the belly is very soft and felty because it passes through the coat of the pestiole and once you have tightened in your arms you cant see it anymore the musics are very soothing the volume adjustment is top you can fall down as it pleases this allows the child to activate his doudou during the night without disturbing those who sleep next door the noise of the mechanism is barely audible with its almost minimum and teddy closed i havent studied too much the other functions cardio in utero but already those used and the reaction of my son which in addition is not at all the fan of the teds allows me to put this little note to the best possible
5,this little otter is just adorable all soft despite the mechanism it holds this little otter has an undeniable calming power thanks to its belly that swells and lowers as if it breathed to the sounds it emits especially a slight snoring or heartbeat and to the sweet starlight on its belly my daughter who is not a baby while the otter addresses the toddlers a priori has difficulty calming down and falling asleep she fell asleep in minutes with her little otter in her arms absolutely delighted with my purchase
5,magic our monthold son hardly slept neither day nor night to the point that the crib threatened not to keep him we had tried several dudous no help was given the otter was adopted from the start our baby was turning her head towards her and her head was held up by the plush the noises are very soothing personally i use the heartbeat my baby loves the noise that mimics a breath is very well as well and another noise mimics the sounds in utero very useful i think for a new baby as soon as it turned well our son started to take the otter in his arms as soon as he was lying in his cradle i see three negative points the tissue of the teddy is not oeko tex i advise to wash it before giving it to baby the nightlight is a little too powerful especially if baby keeps his face all against the otter it would be very useful to add this noise to the baby nevertheless it would be impossible to add a remote control because sometimes we would like to change the mode of giving it to a little otickness
5,we were looking for a music box and came across this sweet otter here you can play different songs make loud and quiet set sneeze noises heart palpitations and a night light pro great music box soft and cuddly sweet design gender neutral sneezing sounds heart palpitations makes rhythmic movements different slumber songs night light easy to use single units can be played or everything can be easily removed at the same time soothing electronics and thus washing machines suitable loud and quiet adjustable contra motor when heart palpitation clearly heard would i buy again at any time highly recommended
5,the otter looks highquality very valuable workmanship and a cuddly soft material its movements and the moderate volume make it a nice baby single holdera beautiful baby gift
5,a very magical music box is that win a cuteness price with me important for me you can adjust the volume well the viper makes different sounds like heart palpitations and soothing melodies it is very fluffysoft and shines also in color but not too much everything is individually adjustable the electronics are removable and the viper is washable cute cute cute
5,so the workmanship is really very good also the design is very sweet kept i personally took out the electronics because this is a bit too clunky and hard however the idea that when playing the music also the bellies of the otter moves along is very nice from the principleoverall full score because you can easily take out the electronic inner life which is then also practically meant to clean the otter super solved
5,i use it every night to help my baby fall asleep the soft light and sell it that swells and then deflates comfort baby i like the melodies included that are very soft and of quality and i find that the white sounds are top depending on the evenings baby falls asleep at the soft sound of the otters breath or the sound of the melodies
5,i am delighted with this purchase article conforming to the description fully machine washable once the electric case is removed several options available possibility to combine music or white noises with breathing motion and soft light about minutes of operation for music or white noises fan intrauterine noise heartbeat or breath noise to choose from and about minutes for light and motion my little last sleeps easily since my purchase i recommend
5,my fourmonthold baby loves this toy while crying he calms instantly when i put it close to him its magic this toy
5,super beautiful plush that liked parents a lotvery easy to washmusic and white sounds perfect on the other hand the movement of the belly is quite noisy to see with the baby
5,we couldnt hope bettera real wonder sweet top music and in addition her little light on her little belly that waves at every snoring is just to crackand the bonus is that it also works for dad and momhyper relaxing
5,super plush very soft and very prettydont make too much noise but sometimes starts working alone
5,at first i thought it was a little expensive and when i got it i realized it was worth it its not just a little bit of music its machine washable and very soft you can choose several options like the moving belly the noise of snoring heartbeat light theres no doubt that baby will appreciate it
5,very cute ideal for a girl or boy plays the best music and very soothing a great gift
5,the mother of the baby was thrilled with this item she places it at the top of her babys crib
5,we buying it for our newborn babies is lovely price as well great at this moment every night our babies nice sleepy
5,what a great toy our daughter loves it and helps her sooth her to sleep watching her stroking it is adorable and really helps her settle
5,bought a few weeks ago for my grand baby who would not settle sleeping away from mummy lovely size and mimics breathing it has other settings but this is the one she preferred
5,my little girl is weeks old and has loved the sounds this otter makes the fur is so soft and the sounds are great my daughter settles much better with these sounds i highly recommend this
5,i purchased for my niece and for my god daughter both born recently both parents are in love with it really works and smooths restless bubbas to sleep so i get brownie points on both fronts
5,i love thisits so incredibly soft and squishy the buttons in the back give you all the options you need light breathing white noise music the songs are soothing the white noise doesnt just sound like a broken old hoover and the motor for the breathing isnt too loud either i think i might steal it from my baby and cuddle it myself d
5,a lot smaller than i thought it would be but great grandson loves it apart from the breathing noise it is a bit disturbing and the little one deosnt like that part other than that successfully gets him back to sleep in the middle of the night if he wakes
5,really love this little otter and so do my kids months and years its adorable the sound of the music is gentle and so is the light its so peaceful and i almost feel like its soothing me to sleep i bought this as a gift for a new baby in the family and kept it oops i will purchase another for baby tried and tested gift
5,i was a little reluctant to spend so much on this toy however its paid for itself already in terms of settling baby and my baby is only days old i love the heartbeat mode my baby is too young to be very interested in the fact it lights up and moves but the sound is clearly very reassuring and settles him to sleep swiftly as a bonus it also settled my husband and i into a quick sleep too
5,absolutely love this for our new born who is due any day now plays a soothing tune and its belly goes up and down like its breathing cute as anything we love otters so this was perfect
5,great for newborns companion ideal to be reassured in a cradle sound of mothers heart melodies night watchful and even the belly that moves at the rhythm of breathing everything programmed in duration really greatonly small defects a little heavy and need to open on the back to change fashion
5,i loved this little otter that i offered as birth gifts for my nephewmy sister is delighted with the gift she found it very beautiful and loved the features
5,a nice product at first i had a bit of trouble adjusting the effects surprising heartbeats you have to pull out the device whenever you want to change function
5,this little animal is very easy to love very well made with lots of features
5,all soft she became the babys doudo she saved us with the white noises at the start to calm the tears with the great advantage of having an adjustable noise she washes very easily unlike other musical plushs and shes all cute in addition to the one minus the sound of the mechanism to mimic the breath but you can disable it very easily like the light perfect
5,my little daughter l√©a three months seemed to be very fond of her otter she stayed for the first time for a long time listening to the heart beats by looking with her head to cuddle with good product to test over a long term the medium term seems to work well since the parents tell me its top to sleep or sleep her back
5,this otter saved the naps and nights of our monthold babythanks to her baby is soothed and sleepy more easily the musics are soft and pleasant unlike many nightsightedthere are lots of soothing noises breathing heartbeat white noises etc on the other hand i find that the breathing movement is useless the noise is enoughi highly recommend
5,cettetz plush is topi regret i didnt buy it beforeits great my yearold girl takes it everywhere and even shes waiting for this plush thats too mimi i could sleep thanks to her jen bought plushs but this one is really happy because she can bring a lot bravo to the inventor who has in turn understood to the kids
5,very soothing music very soft i really love it
5,the product is very pleasant well thought out the settings are easy the maintenance is also very cute my two babies have adopted it be careful for sleep does not work all the time but it helps and it is of course according to the sensitivity of the child
5,very pretty puppy but especially the white noise is really perfect not aggressive in the ears of the parents and appeaseendort baby systematically i strongly recommend it for babies who need the white noise to fall asleep
5,always in my babys bed for the night white noises or soft music alternating help to calm down and sleep more easily an integrated timer stops any noise and movement after minutes gentle to stick it against her she likes it convenient to sleep her
5,super beautiful
5,my monthold son is very happy and loves him
5,my daughter has her otter since birth and shes never left her today shes months old and the effectiveness is real music light and snoring soothes her this otter is great she even fools dad and mom
5,nice appearance
5,hello i am very happy to have ordered this article my grandson he is very happy to have his little fisher prince and very good quality baby falls asleep very quickly thanks a lot amazon
5,i bought it for my son following my hummy who no longer fascinated him and this otter is perfect she has several mode of music noise or snoring too cute i put it on snoring for my baby he loves and when he wakes up at night he can restart it all alone by pressing on his sale i like it a lot
5,this little otter is of an undeniable sweetness she will no doubt become the best friend of the baby the music is soothing as well as the breathing movements the advantage is that the otter can be set machine since the electronic part is easily removed
5,very nice and good product
5,bebe was already sleeping well but the sleep was complicated and took up to an hour from the day we received the otter it was finished in bed with heartbeat and no more a cry unless exceptions obviously when a little sick but really we wouldnt do it anymore
5,it doesnt work all the time for baby but for parents yes its really bluffed by this little otter even if the volume could be higher we can drop the stays under the hood to calm baby down
5,week old granddaughter falls asleep watching the light and listening to the heartbeat very quick as its almost hypnotic if im honest i sometimes use it on heartbeat to fall asleeo to on a bad potentially sleepless night
5,couldnt be without it our little one would easily wake in her sleep so id be up god knows how many times in the night but the white noise function soothes her when she stirs straight back to sleep really cute otter design super soft and snuggly easy to use and any hard bits are cushioned by the outer teddy so perfect for being in a cot with babies
5,this was a christmas gift for my month old grandson and he loved it he obviously isnt playing with toys at the moment but he was smiling at the light and reaching out to touch it as well as grabbing and releasing the fur and he stopped crying when the music was turned on i love all of the options you can choose via the battery unit inside you can have the light music white noise and breathing effect on or off you can also set it so the music goes off after minutes great buy good value for money and i highly recommend it
5,hey guysi got this little cute otter for my daughter for christmas she is weeks old its ssooo soothing the music is sssoo nice n soft and just at the right volume the belly moves in and out and the belly lights up and its not too bright its just enough soon as i put it on within minutes my baby girl is sound asleep it plays for half an hour enough time to put her in a nice soothing sleep till her next feed it calms her when she gets upset its amazing i recommend for every parent to get of these can not recommend enough fantastic product
5,little one likes it only down side is the push button on the stomach is very easily turned off so it doesnt always keep going for very long if shes moving around a lotlovely soft fur just wish the hard plastic inner was a bit smaller as it makes the whole thing quite cumbersome for little hands to hold or hug
5,really pampered this plush soft and relaxing thanks to the possibility to reproduce delicate songs and very light vibrations that make its presence felt to the baby it is also suitable for newborns and it is highly appreciated the possibility to work it in the washing machine removing the electric part inside it is not very cheap but considering the fisherprice quality and the beauty of the product there is everything ideal also for a gift to new parents
5,i gave this otter to the son of my dear newborn friend and i have to say that the parents were happy while the baby will undoubtedly appreciate it in a few months when he can grab it and play autonomouslyhaving the reproduction of sweet sounds and soft lights is perfect to be leaning in the crib next to the child to create a comfortable environment when he is aloneit is possible to wash the plush in the washing machine by removing the electronic part
5,a wonderful thing a two or even three in one at first impact it looks like a puppet it is soft safe it has no sharp part and light then just insert the batteries to turn it into our sons best friend toy emits different varieties of sounds including also the heartbeat really fabulous the thing that amazed me the most is the fact that puppet makes the movement of exhale and breathe very realistically buying advice with my eyes closed
5,i chose this game signed fisherprice for my year old son for the time of nap and nap he liked it a lot and often embraces him even just for game he likes to press on the tummy and see that it does up and down emitting sweet and relaxing sounds the otter is very cute soft hair and soft light grey color that does not cause any discomfort to the children it produces sounds and musicettes relaxing and calming it also produces rhythmic movements of the breath that help the child to calm down you can listen for about minutes white noises musicettes sounds of the womb heartbeat and relaxing sounds accompanied by the rhythmic movement of the bench of the lontra also there is the possibility to adjust the volume of me case you want a smoother sound the light can stay on or you can choose to turn it off it works with pile format of stylus a r preferred by our own but it is definitely to be doing it already
5,puppet in the shape of an otter with sound and light effects the lontra rests supine in its cardboard bed which is also the original box just press the tummy to see the puppet light up and emit a music in addition to seeing the tummy swelling and deflating as if the otter were really breathing in the back we find a large remote control that determines the functions both visual and sound i can wash it in the washing machine without the electric part my convince yes it is a great gift idea for our children who relax with the sweet breath of the puppet breath is the thing that has most affected me in fact it seems to be real an incredible effect also the puppet is very soft is well made so even without using these effects remains a very tender object if you want to save the box we can use it as a cot for the small otter pro excellent seams and finishes visual effects and sounds contact to date
5,excellent product arrived at the merc house it is a wonderful otter of fisherprice well made and soft it has no external seams for the safety of our puppy and has the tummy that moves and that lights up crushing the tummy in fact will emit a few seconds of relaxing music for the child this is more a function that will use the baby because if we go to open it from the back we have many combinations to make the first is the adjustment of the sound level the second is the choice of the ringtone being of so many white noises that reconcile the sleep including the heartbeat the third is the onoff of the light on the tummy while the last function provides only the light without audio the back is velcro and does not have buttons or seams and the batteries inserted are protected by a screw drawer just for the maximum safety for the child
5,one of the most beautiful and tender puppets we have ever seen really keeps the little one company even during the night the realization is very good very soft and is rich in many functions including the one that hit us most is the simulation of the breath really very realistic in addition to the breath this small otter about cm high can simulate also the heartbeat sounds of the womb various sounds and lights all selectable and adjustable for volume and intensity through an electronic device powered by batteries already included which is inside the toy it has a really relaxing and calming power suitable for babies up to about years of age and what important removing the electronic part it is possible to wash the small otter in the washing machine currently it is sold at little more than euro october a price in my opinion more than reasonable to the quality and functionality of this toy of fisherprice a purchase that i recommend with closed eyes
5,finally a puppet representing a different animal not the usual bears that although cuddly are always and anyway monotonous a puppet this new fisher price line has finally reproduced other types of animals because at the bottom there are not only bears cats or dogs in this case it is an otter a sweet otter that will accompany your children during the nann but not only thought obviously for the little ones does not exhaust but its works when the tannins grow i tell you immediately that if i could give more than stars to this puppet i would have given them and now i tell us why the puppet is done well adequate dimensions neither too big nor too small perfect for the nannanna morbid even if it has a retro part of the electronics i am delighted with the aesthetic that in the sounds that are not at all invadable does not simply have the function of the night light which is also soft and does not disturbing the power of the lon it is also funny to be able to breathed through the breathing it is also in the same way of the music and in the music and in the music that it is not able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be used in the movement of the movement of the sounds and is not to be able to use it is not at all of the sounds are not at all things that it is not intru for anything invad it is not invad it is not at all it is not simply the function of the function of night light which is not too much invad it is not at all the function of the function of night that it is not at all too much intru it is not at all too much it is not at all too is not at all too small it is not at all the function of the night which is not at all the function of the function of the other and not at all the other but is not at all the function of the function of the function of the other it is not at all the other it is not at all the other it is not at all the other it is not at all the other it is not at all
5,like pointing out its perfect my daughter washes by falling asleep with it every night

5,among the tenderest animals of the creation the otters have definitely gained a place in the top ten who doesnt love these wonderful creatures fisher price has really made center with this ottershaped plush represented in the most famous and sweet of his poses intent to sleep blissfully on the back with his paws on the chest very soft and cared for in every detail we speak of a toy designed for babies therefore i try dangerous parts but the plus of this toy is that pressing the tummy lights up and the otter simulates the movement of the breathing emitting sounds and music it can be created the ideal combination for each child selecting the type of soundmusic the furate and the volume inside there is the cuore of the toy or the feeding it works with batteries included and the electronic unit that allows to make movements and sounds these elements can be removed thus allowing to wash the babys birthplace in the bedroom a cure for the design is already reproduced in the small
5,this otter is an excellent plush suitable for newborns and small children the toy has the size of x x cm for a weight of g of which grams for the battery only inside it has a battery to be fed with aa batteries by which you can select the type of sound to start at the pressure and adjust the volume level the product is made of polyester with a beige and blue color for the plant of the feet and the inner area of the ear the tail is blue with some bright fishes the consistency of the otter is very soft and delicate when you will start the music relaxing and calming the game will realistically imitate human breathing with movements in the belly to up and down with a pleasant lighting effect the backs have a predefined duration of minutes it is possible to finish the reproduction touching the button on the belly the sounds that the otters appear to be pleasant and relaxing for the newborns that from the trials are also in the best of the days during its many episodes of crying
5,we took this sweet otter for our coming puppet to put it in the cradle with him but as we got home our year old fell in love with it literallythe otter is soft and cute then by pressing the belly you can start the melodies the white noise the beat and the breathit is possible to select the volume and the sounds that you want to make to emit by pressing the button in the back that are under the pellicciottoi have to say that we loved everyone it is a real love
5,after a couple of months of tight test i have availed myself of the help of sofia child of a few months of my colleague i try in my reviews to be always impartial but with products of this type turned to babieschildren i try to be even more picky precisely for the mission they have we start immediately saying that the brand in this sense is a certainty although many do not know that fisher price is totally part of the mattel group since and that within a few hanni the company that controls it closed all the factories in the usa and transferred all the production in cina this small niche just to remind you that despite the very high standards and quality and maniac attention to details as well as the materials of the first order we are talking about the most beautiful products made in china having said this this small to want to look at it well then much pet is really addictivei would say that all the soft plus is a soft feature of the very soft packing mechanism and picking it up with the power of the inside chamber which i am able to clean up but it creates an addiction
5,this beautiful otter of fisherprice is a plush made especially for children especially for newborns to help them sleep better to calm them when they cry and not make them feel alone the otter was made with a device inserted inside the body of the plush a mechanism that can be removed by removing it from the back of the otter thanks to a good opening with the velcro in this way it is also possible to wash the plush in the washing machine the device has six buttons the first two serve to increase or decrease the volume of the music and sounds reproduced by the otter the third reproduces the music of some lullaby in rotation and turns off automatically after thirty minutes the fourth reproduces the breath while sleeping the sound of the wind the heartbeat and the heartbeat when it is active in the womb to switch from one type of sound to the other it is enough to press the button the first time will stop the sound and the second time will be activated by the sound the fifth one can lift the breath to the next
5,a soft plush that you want to tighten right away it represents a beige otter with ears and feet of a light green and the package reproduces a baby cot very cute you turn on pressing the tummy it works with batteries batteries aa v already included in the package in it we find the box battery holder where you can choose one of the four functions of the game music or relaxing sounds you can distinguish the sounds of the maternal womb and also sounds of nature that help calm babies you can feel the breath during sleep and combine the function that simulates a natural breath with the movement of the belly that goes up and down you can also choose to associate a soft light which would be the area of the button on the belly in short you can customize it as you want and very nice thing that pushes me to give full of the votes once removed the box of batteries you can safely wash in a excellent solution
5,i took this delicious otter for my grandson to accompany him in his nap it is a really intelligent gamehelp that i wanted to have available when my children were young because it combines the usual combination of sounds and soft lights also the movement of the tummy that swells and deflates giving the impression of breathing together with the child how many parents have noticed the calming effect of holding the children against their chest to calm them with the perception of their breath well the otter does just that the baby leans on this soft puppet wanting to put a hand on us perceives softness warmth of the hair movement of the breath and in addition the music chosen from true melodies to more neutral sounds just regular first volume and sounds on the back then the otter keeps company for thirty minutes very useful object and splendid gift idea
5,this otter has a very good look and super tender it is made of polyester and is really soft it is beige with the inner part of the ears and the plants of the feet in blue fabric even the inside of the codina is made of fabric with a lovely drawing of small fishes the eyes are closed and the arms are sewn to the chest but they are absolutely not attached to the body so you can fit a small hand the dimensions are x x cm and weighs almost half a kilo because inside closed by a velcro it hosts a battery gigantic which allows you to adjust the volume and choose which sound you want to listen to your baby through keys with very clear designs in fact you can choose between soft music or some relaxing sounds white noises sounds of the womb breath during sleep or heartbeat
5,it works and its the most important thing it helps a lot both to relax that to accompany the children towards the bed but it works well also as antistress for those moments when the puppets tend to be more soundy or they feel neglected excellent pet this otter even if many will exchange it for a bear it turns out to be much more useful than expected if you dont find it disturbing actually the breath with movement colors and sounds is very realistic in fact you can set noises relaxing sounds also human like the heartbeat and music you can match us a soft light on the belly and see it move following the breath everything is customizable and can be activated by the battery pack which has a rather tenacious button to prevent it from starting inadvertently the integrated timer is about minutes shuttering the battery pack you can also wash in the washing machine also i would have a little flaw for the rest i would have been finely padded to the rest of the rest of the material
