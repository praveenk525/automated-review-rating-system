3,its ok with all featuresbut if you just flip the cover without shut down in next opening the system does not responds
3,keyboard lights are absent in this model
3,the only problem with this laptop is its thermal management which is poorly done even when doing light tasks its gets certainly warm on the keyboard surface rest the processor is good fine display and the overall software experience but avoid buying dell laptops as they will get hot under light to moderate usage which is not expected dell should improve its thermal management in laptops

3,performance is super design is super but only problem is charge backup is very very poor percent to just min usage only
3,overall ok but battery very fast drained
3,specifications wise very good and i have no issues in the given laptop windows pre installed and the drivers are also part of software also i would like to see ms office given as part of the laptop
3,battery last only hours instead of to hours according to the description thats lack on integrity on that one but the overall design and display and performance is amazing the battery is the only issue i found so far
3,not working as well as expect some times it lag i am purchase it only on days use battery performance very poor full charge can only hours backup overally not good laptop as compared to others with same price
3,i am giving feedback after a week outside look of laptop is excellent performance is also fine definitely camera wont work for long overall if laptops comes below thousand buy it
3,everything is fine but the product was pre activated i got delivered it on th nov but it was activated on th oct
3,performance is excellent but battery backup is very
3,battery backup is only for approximately hrs if performance applications and games are used then the backup goes down to hrs performance is otherwise good and laptop is smooth and fast display is good as well
3,unfinished product loaded with equipment but not fully optimised
3,specifications given on display page like ms office month subscription are ullu banaving others are good
3,it does have problems like auto restart and shutdown and also shows windows diagnostics system and easy to fix the problem but the camera quality is just awfully cant even say that it is a decent camera it just so bad but the overall machine is good
3,bad product
3,good
3,sometimes automatically shot downlittle little issue are there not recommended to buy
3,this laptop is shutting down frequently and wi fe automatically disconnected not buy this laptop this product is very very bad
3,its switch off suddenly on runing time
3,update bios for auto shutdown it will fix the auto shutdown issue in this laptop no other methods will work i did it through the acer service centre
3,overall best in this amount but it automatically turns off sometimes so i have to connect to charger to on it but value for money
3,received with a faulty ssd but the acer warranty was superb and replaced it within days apart from that the laptop is super with mid range performance and a blazing fast ssd the battery backup is also good providing somewhere around hours with light use and hours with heavy use absolute value for money
3,product more not durable
3,nice product according to price
3,battery will last about hours with light work load if you can compromise on battery then you can go for it update fingerprint sensor is faulty overheating issue
3,moderate device hangs within second day of usage not sure how reliable this can be in the long run getting hot with just the device turned on and having one or two browsers open battery drains much faster audio is just okay
3,battery performance is very week one full charge is coming only hrs only
3,to go
3,bad screen and battery lifeits a gaming laptop dont expect much
3,laptop works fine the biggest disadvantage is the keyboard the print on the keys is hardly visible and you need a brightly lit up room to identify the keys makes my work slower
3,display not fit properly
3,super new features
3,product is okay but dont bye if the seller is pooja compute seller is fraud
3,in k its ok but i have doubts on this long term durability performance is also ok ok
3,heating issue battary issue fingerprint dont work
3,sometimes it lacks
3,this product doesnt have access to microsoft office
3,you can buy other laptop than zebronics just add more in your budget not good for gaming and high performance low performance low fps laptop

3,performance is good not happy with the display if u change ur angle from front colors are changed backlit keyboard batter backup is average speed is good power button not having lightso when u on it u hv a doubt of it upto display appears sec
3,product is good with this price tag rtx gpu is a plus point battery life is very low around hours for only browsing bad thing about flipkart is they give us old laptop whose battery is issued months beforehand
3,just good
3,cant fully use the rtx it always go through the integrated gpu radeon causing loss and the display driver is locked to the amd integrated graphics cardu cant use rtx directly cant get the full power of it
3,overall laptop is good performance is good i played some games runs very smoothly but the battery backup is very bad it only gives hour normal usage with battery saver hour
3,sound quality low other okok
3,i am writing this review after month of use there are some pros and cons in it but it is value for money in k cons battery consumption it lasts only for hour in gaming and in normal usage hours maximum low volume its volume speakers sound is lower than my phone volume literally without headphones you hear properly in photo and in question area they said it has rgb lights but in real it has only white backlit keyboard pros in every question and answer area ppl s read more
3,perfect gaming laptop if you get it under k
3,overall performance and battery life is great i cant say the same with build quality it feels fragile also it has the shittiest trackpad which stopped working completely in just months the lower body is replaced in warranty but such problems too early is not expected they opened the whole laptop and now build quality is even more degraded since then
3,product is good will review after few months usage
3,the battery capacity in months of usage dropped to of the original with just charge cycles but if you are using it with just internet connectivity and productivity tasks then it lands you around hours of backup in initial days and what happens after it i already mentioned it speakers are a bit disappointing with low loudness display is good with pretty nice peak brightness
3,everything is good but not better but camera mic low quality and speaker also when in the room silence not sound speaker volume cant listen to much low sound but you can listen sound when u lift the laptop and near arount your ears speaker to much bad really to much bad
3,avarage
3,performance is ok but the sound is found lacking the audio is not audible even at full volumes not meant for zoom calls and audio enthusiast
3,sound quality is very poor
3,its ok
3,not value for the money and at least the upper body should be in metal but not the body of the laptop is plastic and scratches in only one month of use in full body
3,product is good but purchase not flipkart
3,performance not much delivered when we were using multiple tabs ram almost took consuming for multi taskingwe cant expect more from this laptop average

3,see if you are choosing this for creative works like coding animation or some gaming kind then this is a good choice but for content consumer its a bad choice cause the sound quality is literally the worst i have ever experienced you have to use external speaker see i am a current user and i m not just joking or anyway commenting on product whatever i shared was my feedback after usage
3,the worst part of this laptop is the battery backup i thought its a creator series laptop and it would give at least hours on normal usage it made me wrong and giving just hours in normal usage even in battery saver mode dont know is this in my laptop or in every laptop of this series another disappointment is heating issue even in normal usage it heats a hell the fan will start running and make sounds performance is ok on plug and play ie when connected with charger read more

4,volume key not working
4,the touchpad sounds like a low grade plastic when you tap on it a little hard so it needs improvement battery backup is good just customise battery performance in the setting window home is a drawback no ms office included rest all other things are good like performance sound design etc
4,after using this laptop for a week i am giving you the honest review the laptop is really exceptional at this price range with i processor best for business work body is made up of polycarbonate plastic with nice friction body which helps in holding display is nice almost hr battery backup i have only one issue that is the charger which comes with it is not made by acer company due to this its adaptor gets heat quickly overall nice experience go for it
4,i bought the laptop about weeks ago initial impressions are that the performance of the laptop is really good pretty fast laptop looks good as well the display is average sound quality can also be improved i have also noticed some heating issues as well
4,i bought this mac bcz i wanted to buy a mac using it for last week initial impression is great will update the review in future i get spare time
4,i have used it for almost a year and my experience was great
4,got it in bbd its an amazing machine working so good got a good deal thanks flipkart
4,there is no need to review this product as when it comes to apple it gives you the best and premium feel though the macbook is good the only disadvantage is the storage issue as it doesnt provide greater storage capacity

4,ok for home use
4,osm mst
4,good product
4,its too good value for money
4,value for money product mainly for official use and a light gaming good for college students however the display and sound speakers are not very good
4,for the look performance sound quality webcam display battery life while running heavy software research software for dft is maximum hours otherwise in standby mode hours is the battery life data transfer speed with sata ssd external drive is maximum mbps as it has nvme type ssd so its faster than the external drive for the value for money
4,as per specifications mentioned i gen gb ram tb ssd win this is the best product in this price range but ill rate it as star because of reasons sound output is of very low volume it is acceptable because this laptop is under business laptops category web camera quality is very much below par
4,sound is too bad but the other thing is perfect
4,good for simple task not for multitask
4,overall a good package at budget pricing
4,its a good laptop but i would suggest to go for a latest upgrade in this price range i got it at k

4,the asus vivobook on this price range with core i th gen processors offers reliable performance and a sleek design however the display quality falls short of expectations which can be a significant drawback if you rely on your laptop for tasks that demand a better screen if you can overlook the display aspect and prioritize performance these laptops could still be a good choice for your needs

4,decent product
4,the h series chipset is indeed a powerhouse designed to deliver topnotch performance that can handle demanding tasks with ease its no surprise that its the goto choice for those who prioritize speed and reliability in their computing experience however the tradeoff for this high performance is the increased battery consumption a common challenge in performanceoriented laptops the oled display adds to the visual experience with its vibrant colors and deep blacks but it also contri read more

4,goof
4,the product is very nice and ok for the pricebut the battery runs down easily
4,there is lag with multiple processes as the processor speed is ghz it heats a lot and drains battery faster due to continuous running of the fan another lacking thing is ms office you only get a trial version of it rest all us perfectly fine as of now with a few days of usage
4,awesome look very nice cost of the product quality good

4,laptop is best in this price range it didnt have a single review when i bought it but i am impressed by its overall performance best suited for office guys like me
4,i bought this for k in this price range its one of the best laptop for light uses display and built quality is very good and the sound quality also it works faster go for this product
4,one of the best product of lenovo apart from battery life everything else is perfect looks good as compared to dell or hp laptops performs really well
4,overall good laptop purchased it for k i think in this price range its a killer machine you will definitely go with it the battery is also good and laptop is slim and light with a powerful gen processor sound of the speakers is also good one thing which i like to add is that there is backlit support but there is only one mode for backlit its not too good so which is acceptable if you are looking for a laptop for your daily college work and coding you may go with this one
4,i have been using this laptop and i am satisfied with the performance its amazing laptop in this price range
4,everything is top notch except battery which drains very fast
4,this is working super

4,all are good except build quality speaker sounds good for meetings and movies build quality could have been better
4,laptop is very good at performance i have run power bi and big excel sheets i dont see lags but when it comes to the battery i can see only hrs of battery after a full charge display brightness also needs to be kept atleast above even using at home sound is also audible but suitable only in a closed room or office shld connect it to bluetooth device in outdoor meetings
4,laptop is best for all things only problem with battery only to hrs backup when you have to use it before that plug in the charger after that you can use for hrs rest of this are excellent
4,product is overall goodbut build quality needs to better and also rtx and gtx both gives same performanceand not any big difference in between i th and th generationbut good deal and i fully recommend to buy this laptop

4,good for normal use

4,product is very good value of money not activated microsoft officehow can activated microsoft office
4,when i first got the product it didnt turned on but later after charging it for couple of minutes it did start up my review after a week of use display is way better than my old asus tuf f support upto k videos battery is worst for highend working lasts less than hours while editing but lasts upto hours if only playing videos performance is good for this segment overall the product is decent for the price of k credit card offer
4,one of the best choice for gaming and money for value product sata ssd not support in it it has slots for m nvme ssd

4,worth the price got it in bbd sales till now everything seems good
4,a good laptop
4,its a core i processor means very heavy multitasking will not be possible but graphics related processes are smooth go for gb ram only as heavy processes will need it otherwise it will be a total hang in coming years
4,good prod
4,good quality this price
4,value for moneygood for home usage gaming not tested performance is also good for home usage
4,if anyone buy for excel sheet work its not free in this laptop
4,first laptop
4,value for
4,good product if getting under k value for money
4,value for money
4,one of the best laptop of this price display battery everything is fine
4,it is a very good product at this price range but i feel a little bit slow processing when running the laptop other wise the display quality and laptop quality is good but the processing speed is may be better
4,performance is good display is also up to the mark but when you watch side of the screen it shows black battery for non stop use design is awesome
4,display is not upto the mark the graphics card is also a bit outdated for modern games but it is good for moderate gaming and other graphic intensive tasks
4,all are good but sound quality is low
4,every thing is excellent but camera quality is lower than p due to camera otherwise
4,good performance except battery backup and build quality
4,good but very heavy
4,laptop is very nice display is average
4,its good and didnt disappoint
4,i was expecting some accessories and fingerprint sensor with this kind of specification but overall its a good buy
4,nice build colour gamut quality
4,every thing is best in this laptop except battery overall value for money k in deal
4,nice but battery not good
4,if anyone use hz screen settings then get battery backup upto hrs
4,a very good product in this price range battery couldve been better but that is not an issue cause i use it for coding and it lasts up to hours so yes if anyone wants to buy it then go for it
4,value for money working good delivered yesterday
4,overall the laptop performs well but the absence of an sd card slot is a significant drawback this omission was not clearly mentioned which was misleading as all other swift go models include this feature
4,initial review pros metal body fingerprint sensor camera cons very low speaker output should have given tb ssd laptop has slots of ram both used
4,overall the laptop is good but i reduced one star because the display is only average no proper clarity even in pixels and speakers also producing less sounds rest of performance it is buttery smooth with gb ram and gb ssd one good thing is the vents are colourful and less noise levels good for coding purpose
4,laptops build quality isnt the best but okay in this price point the fan starts spinning loud just for daily tasks yet to check gaming performance battery backup is bad but watt charger is sweet charges the laptop in hours
4,fps on k with ultra settings in witcher enhanced edition
4,good performance till now
4,display is good performance is also good but the sound is very low battery backup is also low if the company improves these two it will be a very good laptop
4,thermals are very good but while running heavy apps like davinchi resolve and games like the evil within the app crashes we have to opp and on the laptop
4,all aspects of this laptop is ok but screen wobble is serious otherwise totally worth it
4,great buy
4,very good productvery nice designit feels like a k laptopamazing ips display battery life is around hours easily just check for any screen bleeding issue after you get deliveryoverall value for money
4,every thing is excellent bugget friendly product but right click refresh window frequency is some time low
4,excellent value for money for those not needing gaming capability robust construction light and compact camera could have been better
4,very good product at an affordable rate
4,good laptop go for it
4,the battery is good but charging gets slow from to very slow and the display is also good but for gaming the battery loses fast for video it lasts around to hours multitasking is also good writing this review after using it one day
4,nice
4,weight and battery life rest is fine
4,design is good processor is good best laptop within this range i got it in k from flipcart cons switch on button taking more time to get activated battery backup is only upto hrs only
4,hp laptop with i processor and genaration is good for daily collage usage leval and window is like something extra that makes a good thing even better
4,very good product uder k display good but not best battery capacity not sufficient for laptop otherwise design is very good and also backlit key board this price of range yea its a good laptop in my opinion
4,performance displaygreat build quality not that good sharp edge i have used electric tape battery hour value for money maybe best at this price k
4,good quality display and performance is good but sound quality camera not good this laptop heating problem
4,so its nice
4,very good item smooth function
4,everything is good but battery backup quite low but enough
4,performance is good charge speed is great pretty lightweight lacks a bit on battery backup also it developed a noise from inside like a screw is loose or something plus now the led keyboard red light that showed mute audio is not lighting up anymore otherwise all good but it was an overpriced purchase
4,good quality product value for money i am writing a review after days of delivery battery backup to hoursperformance is good but sometime small glitch are found
4,go for it
4,it was amazing i bought it for k in sale first look is fully impressed and come to performance it was soo cool there is one disappoint that is bettary it exactly works hoursthis review is just days only
4,awesome products i am using this products for day i play game and do coding its performance is awesome no lacking in game but camera quality is poor
4,very high performance laptop best for gaming and all other works
4,it would be better to dual channel instead of single channel
4,it is value for moneybut couldve been better one major thing is it should be mentioned that its single channel ram bought the gb ram variant thinking it would come with dual channel ram but disappointedonly one stick of gigs rtx w tgp is very good i is niicee display is meh the hz is nice no mux switch but get a hybrid switch thermals are awesome very appropriate for a room with no ac build and design is superb u donot get any bags or extras j read more
4,good performance
4,performance and great thermal of this laptop make it a value pack the only down side is the ips panel and the weight see the screen is pretty bright and have srgb color gamut but in term of contrast it falls behind and not very appealing when one is consuming ott content in a dark ambience lighting and the laptop is pretty heavy
4,a great value bit heavy
4,good spec considering its price
4,the laptop is great has many many features but does not have microsoft office personal you have to buy it but better performance and ssd makes it more powerful the battery can be hours gaming or hours open light work normal brightness
4,value for money
4,good job by zebronics nice laptop

4,it is best laptop in this range
4,well everything meet up to my expectations exept the battery
4,this a good laptop in this segment
4,good quality
4,performance is pretty good it is fast enough to handle some of the mid range heavy application like games heavy software etc very easilyalongside its battery backup is as mentioned in specifications provides backup of hour on normal uses depending upon settings and application display is also very good overall experience is very good its a very powerful laptop in this budget just go for it
4,as of now it is working good
4,i like this laptop i shall update my comment after one month laptop design is mindblowing the display quality is not like hp apple but not like infinity either no keyboard lights either but you wont get gb ram and gb rom either in other laptops
4,best experience for watching for movies in dolby atmos but it taking hours for full charge and you can use it continuously for to hrs only microsoft office is not pre installed and it is asking for premium to use
4,one thing to note for anyone buying this the i hx doesnt disappoint along with the rtx gpu it can run most of the aaa games at p with ease the battery life is average as its a gaming laptop the predator sense is something the acer needs to improve on the keyboard lighting setting doesnt apply sometimes overall id give an
4,looks good at first sight
4,touchpad should be redesigned overall good laptop for performance tasks
4,it was a nice product but windows is making it slow gaming experiance is nice
4,product is very good battery life up to hours
4,this one is having gb ram only lag observed in nfs heat if you search the requirements for this game you will see that gb ram is required for smooth gameplay old games and gta etc worked fine i sort of use it for office work and budget was tight light gaming as of now all over budget friendly gaming laptop and hp laptops are known to last i took hp because my old laptop lasted years although there was continuous gaming it was hp pavilion g notebook
4,good design
4,best in segment if you are gamer you can go for it if you have budget of lakh display is nice brightness is awesome performance next level camera is average but its fine we can manage

4,very good prod
4,btw a very good laptop performance is very good you can do any type of editing easily display is also decent you can do colour grading and watch netflix and its design is also nice lookwise but for me its little bigger to hold or carry it every time and overall i loved this laptop btw battery at silent mode is avg if in performance mode then mkc
4,display and performance is good i tried only pubg yet the bad think is battery backup and speakers are not louder enough even my iphone speakers feel louder than it otherwise its good performance feel good while laptop is charging but without charging its feel little slow when you open apps files but im satisfyied till now
4,some finger print on laptopi think one is the prons
4,powerful processer in this price design good
4,display is bluerr
4,looking premium quality but battery back up hours with internet connection and excellent performance product
4,the laptop is very sleek its gaming laptop but still looks very professional no rgbs no unnecessary designs perfect for me got it for k during bbd sale and its the most worth it deal ever if anyone is planning to buy it make sure to wait for some sale and get it below k the battery is decent works for hours but just plug it in everytime its a gaming laptop and you get a w charging brick the keyboard is really good backlight is white and not rgb theres no wobbli read more

4,osm but ohz
4,best laptop under k with ryzen h gaming processor you can buy it for coding gaming but it is heavy so u can feel uncomfortable while carrying it for college

4,laptop looks cool and its as per specs and performance good battery is bit poor as it is compensated for performance one important this is there mux switch in this but in poster it is shown it has mux switch
4,its value for money
4,preferable windows rather than ubontu
4,just for everyones info this laptop has gb ram sticks which i think that is not good as most of the users will surely be willing to upgrade the ram so they have to completely remove the existing rams and install new or sticks which i think is waste of money and also theres no extra storage slot so if you want to increase storage than you have to replace the existing ssd rest assured this is a very good deal if you bought it under k and also there are rumours about this lapto read more
4,very powerful laptop must buy in this price range thanks flipkart all high games run very smoothly
4,over all good product in this price range pros good performance good lcd display good sound quality cons average battery life battery back not good heating issue

4,nice product
4,very good laptop
4,the laptops performance has been been top notch for the price but the only diappointment i have is with the battery life since the laptop has no vram for any slightly intensive tasks the gpu kicks in effecting the battery life i got upto hrs while playing a game and browsing which is not that great considering the other options available also i installed a tb ssd in the second slot since the gb wouldnt be enough at allall in all its a good laptop for the price

4,wonderful product but need to improve battery back up

4,product is good blenovo loq ryzen with gb ram all parts are genuine the design is goodlooking and there are only minor heating issues otherwise the battery capacity is decent and charging is fast overall its great for editing purposes but flipkarts delivery was terrible i was really stressed out as it took many days for the product to arrive and their response was not good either
4,this review will be detailed covering everything about the ryzen h rxm variant lets start with gaming performance performance this laptop handles games well but a major problem is occasional stuttering its not due to power as the rxm is quite powerful similar to an rtx sufficient for p gaming i believe its because of the pcie gen port limitation as the ryzen only supports gen pcie and unfortunately it cant be solved display the nits bright read more
4,overall good performance but only issue is battery
4,i didnt expect the aspire series to give the laptop with hz display and gb ram and gpu but the laptop i have purchased has it all i also owned an acer aspire laptop with a hz display and the difference is visible happy with the purchase will keep you all posted with a long term usage review
4,laptop qulity is very good performance is good

4,very nice but ms office kit missing
4,awesome display
4,value for money laptop
4,everything is finebut the cooling fan is making very loud noise
4,assume product but sometimes cooling fan makes noise
4,i bought this laptop during the diwali bajaj finance offer for k after one month of use i can honestly say that the laptops performance design and display are wonderful however i am disappointed with two things the battery life and sound quality the camera is okay and we were able to play normal games but the battery drained in just two hours overall i think its a good value for money laptop
4,performance is good i played games like valorant lara croft no lag screen drop but charge backup is less
4,nice value for money display is good and also key is very smoothly press and very nice performance draw back but only one draw back is speaker sound is slow
4,performance is high quality display also top
4,the battery lasts about hours on balanced mode the display is awesome watching content quality is good max tb ssd available microsoft lifetime free speakers are good for a room not evo certified thunderbolt port not available metal build looks premium and slim type c charger no heating problem using it for casual office work and content watching
4,good cpu and gpu performance average battery good display colors are good but in dark image it shows display bleeding build quality is okish thermals are better than asus tuf in this budget value for money in the price bracket i will update this review after long term usage
4,good but color are change
4,power zabardast design good display goodcan play k videos easily the battery drains quickly while gaming but enough while normal use hours speaker quality is low finger sensor fast working excellent laptop for cad softwares
4,best laptop under k
4,apart from heating issues the laptop is pretty osm
4,worth yes at this price range totally worth it i got this at k for varient in big billion sale after applying k off from hdfc debit card performance is beast it is up to date display is good customisation is also worth it just go for it
4,display is great rgb keyboard also but battery and speakers are down side for this laptop other than that smooth performance and value for money product
4,the overall design of the laptop is good it looks great and its built quality is very good as well i had a performance problem i ordered the gb variant thinking that it will come in gb sticks laptop performance is maximum if you use same sticks in duar channel memory but it came with only one gb ram which is making the laptop a little bit slow but the camera and mic are good and the processor for this price is a steal really but you have to take care of the thing i told earlie read more
4,good product i loved all of its features battery is quite good worth for value charged for it i liked the keyboard and its colour it good outline of this product is great a little disappointment with the heat from pc if we use for long time though the product is great packaging is good
4,first of all backlit keyboard not available all over good performance display superb
4,nice product you should go for it
4,guys this laptop is really amazing value for money and i bought it for k please note this dont ever try to install any cracked games especially from gameloop then you will end up in the blue screen after restart and then you have to just reset the laptop like me which takes too long time if you guys end up in the blue screen just turn on the laptop and press f key then choose reset pc
4,product is very good but battery performance is very poor
4,good product no issue
4,good performance value for money
4,value for money like the product
4,looks good build quality is solid very little flex oled screen is awesome cannot test the performance but ram on this machine is of mhz approx and best in class lpddrx speakers are not loud enough expected the speakers like previous lenovo laptop but the front firing speakers on this model is just average or belowaverage feels slight sensation while charging due to metal body all this is based on day usage
4,great display great build great processor i think at this price it is the best laptop as of now
4,okayish linux support but that is to be expected with new hardware nothing unusable running silverblue overall good value for money
4,everything is excellent except the screen quality value for money
4,this particular laptop is very good in terms of performance display and other features at this price point
4,most powerful laptop
4,the speaker quality is not too good and also the brightness is just okay it some has software glitch that breaks the sound during session rest it is a value for money gadge
4,best in this price range battery backup is decent unlike other reviews and it depends on usage and optimisation cons that i noticed rest everything is perfect for me speakers are not loud but its a not a big thing for me i can use external speakers during gaming heats a bit around the keyboard area as the air flows through the keyboard into the fans and gets out of the bottom wish it would have additional storage capacity for one more ssd
4,i loved this one first laptop of my life and im fully satisfied with it except battery
4,overall the product i received was value for money but the only con i faced was its speakers
4,best laptop ever for beginners
4,was good occasionally sucks thats because i use really heavy apps such as abaqus fusion matlab ansys for my research i play gta v too no lag its really smooth not but i am a heavy user my laptop is on all the time gb ram and i gaming processor at this price was just perfect i use external hard disk so ssd is at its optimal speed
4,better as compared other laptop inthis range but microsoft office not work you have to purchase exal powerpoint wordpad
4,i played gta v and game is running smooth when i plugd in
4,with bank offer near k nice laptop
4,good normal work
4,very good product performance full on battery backup on screen keypad quality very good touch pad mouse very good my thinking all over performance and value for money this is the one of best laptop
4,gud laptop in this range really has a quick booting
4,very smooth performances it has an antiglare display as well hertz
4,pros good price to performance good after sales service easy to take apart great form factor for gaming and casual use comes with an extra nvme slotpcie for more storage cons speakers are useless usb ports are not good quality need to fiddle around to make sure all pins make contact screen blead keyboard gets very hot while gaming but the temps are within normal range
4,nice product if u want to compromise on battery and display little build quality would have made this more good but good to go
4,overall good experience
4,excellent
4,nice chromebook best value of money design and prosessor is very good but display is not good dissent display
4,build quality is very good latest configuration with ai support oled display is very nice only downside i feel is bottom side fan should be else where and battrey life be better considering ai offering in this good for normal usage bit of games and editing due to latest processor and graphics
4,i purchased this for below k it was amazing performance was next level and battery also good if you are normal user battery was up to hrs the only concern is sound it was ok but not goodmiss the base and they compromise in hinge also
4,great laptop but speakers could be better
4,its really good
4,nice but some time playing game you feel lag then you use charger with laptop and play no lag found
4,value for money at this price performance is better for basic gaming and hd video editing
4,awesome laptop value for money
4,sound quality is too less apart from it all good nice product
4,every thing is perfect except sound
4,display not eye comfortable
4,build quality awesome only is missing there is backlit and
4,great laptop test
4,overall good laptop at reasonable price for light work i am using it since last one year pros good battery life from hrs to hrs depending upon work intensity good processor ok kind of build quality cons below average display ok for text reading but not for viewing video speaker is not loud enough remember to inspect properly before takin delivery as some back panel screw was missing in my unit

4,hi all i bought this laptop performance as per price performance is ok but not ok for heavy users as it starts lagging design design is good but build quality is ok ok display as per price good value for money yes it is battery hours
4,all things is good but sound quality is low and display is good at this price point
4,the product looks very good on first impression very much worth for the price the only con i faced is display really not good but for programmers and basic office users this will be an excellent choice

4,review after months battery backup is so mid it doesnt even last hr performance wise decent at this range as i completed rdr and ghost of tushima rdr ran very smoothly in maximum graphics and with ghost of tushima it ran smoothly only in low graphics and i tried high graphics lags insanely bad sound wise it is decent to good and i edit videos with both ae and premiere pro and rendering and editing doesnt have any issues overall a decent lap at this range
4,good laptop in reasonable price
4,brilliant performance at this price starts up in secs closes in display is not up to mark

4,good product overall

4,pros light weight and simple design performance due to ssd battery is enough around hours licensed ms office cons power button design sometime you have to press twice build quality is not solid this means you need handle with more care in general a good laptop for home and students use
4,wonderful speed and performance however few cons are reported for instance fan is making lots of noise and battery backup is hours while normal running operation otherwise value for money
4,pros performance is very good i use visual studio for development and on my old i system visual studio would take forever to load and run applications on this system i can run multiple sessions of visual studio without any lag ms office provided cons build quality is not that great it can not connect to ghz band of wifi ghz works well display is nothing to boast about however it works without any issues verdict if you need good performance provided read more

4,value for the product cost effective ssd quick to work almost all the functions of a basic laptop hp a trusted brand negative points slight lag especially when ram is gb poor display quality web cam is not up to the mark plastic body difficult to dissipate heat overall for cost effectiveness with such features but has alot of scope for improvement

4,cons heating issue within or minutes of switching on the laptop it heats uphave been using in an ac room so it didnt get uncomfortably hot fan noise is a big thing that too the outlet is at the bottom of the screen and facing the screen so the fan noise is very clearly heard battery backup is above average can live with it though barring the above two points the laptop is perfect i have no issues and its worth the money and i had bought it during goat sale

4,product acha hai liken battery is low lasting soung v tura sa pro
4,got this beast few days backoverall its good im currently using this as a daily driver ive tweaked some settings for battery life as this is not good hrs in normal usage will update after some daysmonths
4,some of the specifications are not value for money like display brightness and design of keyboard i will prefer it if you travel daily with your laptop simply lightweight gaming laptop
4,the performance is unmatched i mean helios is better but u get hp branding m i right the arrival time was delayed times so star for that as ridder never even picked up the call but about the performance its a monster i have played miles morales ghost of tsushima cyber punktekkan and the performance even at the max settings was fabulous the only other good thing can be hz screen with srgb so if u r getting this laptop under k its a steal anything less is a sure bu read more
4,the laptop is nice from the hardware and the built quality side people are saying that the display quality is not that great yeah its not that great its good just enough for everyday task and if you are that hardcore editor then you probably have a monitor then this laptop is highly recommended because of the specs and the omen built quality and support it give dts software which is direct competitor for dolby they basically are the same thing and you get microsoft officr student life read more

4,so far after using it for almost a month i find design and display is awesome performance is good sound quality also good battery backup decent only issue i faced that keypad and mouse trackpad is lagging after sometime min of use visible delay in key press event but if you use any external keyboard and mouse then no issue seeing the price of this laptop i am ok with it
4,value for money with i th gent processes even though the update is needed for better optimization
4,laptop overall is very good for this range if you dont want to play games of gbs or your work doesnt need dedicated gpu then this laptop is going to be a good choice i saw many reviews complaining about its touchpad and i havent faced any problem yet although i use it from morning to evening battery backup is normal good it gives easy hour complete backup you might find heating issues if you place it on a soft material but just raising or inches from back like putti read more

4,its a good product for to commercial use
4,i am using this model laptop around day and found everything is good except battery hr and and charger heating problem
4,having used this device for about days the difference between a smartphone and a laptop gets even more blurred this is not a power workhorse machine and it is not designed to be one but it sure is a great asset for simple daily activities such as surfing emailing and some conferencing from home display is soso and hence if that is important for you then advise to go for a higher end laptop but for this price point this is a very good buy if you need the experience of your android read more
4,nice
4,laptop is perfect for students those who are cant afford laptop from well known brands i have used it till days there is no disappointment that i have faced i felt battery backup could be more that i see due to low performance processer i got typically to hr battery backup in study related perpuse this is not for heavy user even not for casual gammersit only can play retro ps games overall its a good value for money package thank you have a good day

4,i like most things about this laptop but the main thing i dislike about it is the display although everything is crisp and clear the screen has a lot of screen bleeding its only noticeable when the screen is dark when youre in a dark room if youre buying this laptop expect screen bleeding if it doesnt bother you then its a solid pick
4,i bought it during sale when the price was listed as k i bought it in exchange so what i paid was really just k i have debloated windows and have changed a lot of settings i also run it on balanced mode and the review below is based on the same after a usage of about days pros good display i also have a mbp i inch model and i dont feel like display quality is degraded when switching from mbp to this laptop so that should give you some clue battery life is good as read more

4,giving me honest review after days usages performance is top notch without any doubt display quality is good but hz bottleneck the cpu power speaker quality is good make sure to install dts processing app to boost the volume and to change the equalizer according to your content battery is better than most of the gaming laptop without any question biggest problem is with touchpad the experience will make you super angry on infinix just buy a separate bluetooth or read more
4,i have taken delivery of this laptop yesterday and writing this review after using the laptop for about hours strength of this laptop is high specifications such as intel core i processor and gb ram built quality looks decent with metal body very reasonably priced for such top specifications and decent display with better viewing angles weaknesses of this laptop are battery charger supplied with this laptop is too heavy and not the ctype charger though d read more

4,the specs of this laptop are the best at this price range no other laptop brand gives this specs at this price range only problem is thermals of this laptop are not good but its ok ok this laptop got around d mark time spy score you have to use cooling pad compulsory while doing high performance tasks or while gaming i didnt test it completely but this laptop can handle games at p with an average fps of in top popular games without any dlss
4,been using since days the temps are good more than what i expected the cpu is not under performing so much the build is also good the temps stay around while i was playing cyberpunk for hrs on k ray tracing on the keyboard quality is also good the fan noise is loud tho there are some bugs in clevo software i hope they get fixed soon
4,great machine using this machine from weeks only issue is battery backup it is not sufficient to power the machine for more than hour i bought the blue one and upgraded with gb ram and additional sdd machine display is good overall value for money in this price range

4,value for money for basic things very good
4,im writing this review after one week usage design and build quality is good and looks wise awesome but performance wise a little bit slow but compared to cost it was good the main flaw was charger quality was poor and it was watt it takes nearly to get charging full and with full charge we can use upto hours comparing to other new laptops it was average battery capacity camera quality is poor it was another flaw finally it was worth it for student purpose it was than enough
4,this has a twocore processor where each core runs at ghz two cores is fine but ghz is extremely slow and you will feel it right away even when you want to type something or when you try to change the volume when playing media so performance suffers badly do not expect to play any d games it also suffers badly in some d games but you will be able to play most nonfancy d games at playable frame rates the sound was loud enough for me though i have not explored much in that read more

4,its working good so for good battery backup sounds quality good but not much loudly overall good laptop with nice performance no major problem found till yet using since one week
4,the laptop looks gorgeous and has many great features but the thing i dont like the most is the air vents are behind and not on the sides so this makes the bottom right of the screen heat up this is a bit concerning but i hope the designers foresaw this already
4,i think it is a good option for students for studying purpose and some entertainment purpose too
4,for this priceokgor for it

4,good product but little lagy in office work like ms excel
4,people who wants great display and design and average performance and battery can have this
4,battery is bad vantage the control system of lenovo needs much modification like asus they should give an update of some kind of student mode in which the battery use should be most efficient for tasks which wont use much cpu or gpu they already have a quite more but that also doesnt extend the battery life to the extent needed rest the laptop is great display keyboard build quality par

4,value for money
4,in this price range this inch laptop is the best choice performance is really good all internal hardware components are good and users easily use all the features but the sound quality is low otherwise you use the speakers then no problem
4,im reviewing after months of usage i use this laptop for my office work this laptop is good for students office work i dont recommend this for gamers or video editing battery back up is not up to the mark but a good deal as compared to the competitors who are charging plus k for the same configuration go for it if you are under budget
4,overall laptop is good few important points whoever is going to purchase ram is not upgradable typec port doesnt support display only datapower this means your typec dock will also not work for display you may try display link docks but they are too costly webcam and speakers are very average performance overall design keyboard and display are good in this price range i bought gb model around k tried fedora linux everything worked out of the box
4,good laptop for this price range performed well for moderate usage battery backup is also good enough
4,pros performance is excellent at this price range its really slim and keypads are good as it is specifically designed for productivity cons speaker sound is low web cam picture quality is poor it looks like p
4,this is my the first laptop in my life i have purchased by my own very sleek design and value for money product in this price range i bought it in sale bragging the lowest price performance and other things are good as per this price range highly recommend laptop
4,a very good product for someone whos low on budget and need a decent laptop for day to day tasks i do some light editing tasks too on photoshop and illustrator works fine probably because mine is gb ram varient battery couldve been slightly better though it works well overall its a balanced budget laptop atleast better than other budget laptops of established brands who dont give bigger mousepad and backlit keyboard in this price msi modern has it
4,performance wise good but slightly less battery life in my opinion apart from everything is good
4,its screen is hinging slightly while typing the screen is hingeing but overall it is good
4,display is no so good
4,value for money and software are also good
4,best laptop under but sound is ok ok blue color is better
4,its almost a week since i am using this laptop and i just wanted to say display speakers performance is good all over its good
4,nice performance
4,best laptop i really like the modern series of msi but i rate it stars for the modern cm because it has a best processor best performance and sexy design but in this model ssd is upgradable but ram is non upgradable btw laptop is best i suggest to those who want to buy this model buy gb variant only
4,got this laptop during diwali sale in just k with gb ram display performance battery life and build quality are all good only issue which i feel in this laptop is space bar key it works perfectly if press at the middle but when i press at corner then sometimes it doesnt work i took it to the service centre but as per them its a known issue in msi laptop and wouldnt solve even if they change the keypad rather than returning this laptop i am trying to adjust by pressing little read more

4,best in this segmentgo fot it for doing your regular tasks
4,had been using this machine since the last days or so and here is what i have experienced so far display probably one of the best if not the best you can best display you can get for the price the aspect ratio is very good for productivity like writing word documents programming but not so good for media consumption as you see those black bars on the top and the bottom with k resolution texts look sharp colors are punchy and blacks are quite deep for an lcd display you also get read more
4,its good for daily users but not a gaming laptop battery backup good charging fast design and build quality awasome light weight performance overall goodi loved it

4,im writing this review after days of usage everything is good but the charger heats like hell during charging battery backup is good although display and speakers are impressive not that much loud but the quality is good build quality is excellent feels sturdy in hands but lack of some ports might be a downgrade for some peoples but i have no issue with this boot up in sec and shut down in within secso speed and performance is good in the last i just want to say lapto read more
4,nice laptop under k and nice performance in this price range very good laptop in daily work
4,display the display exhibits decent antiglare properties but the color accuracy leaves something to be desired users accustomed to srgb devices may find text readability challenging initially portability easy and lightweight to use battery life the battery holds up well during idle periods with minimal power drain users can expect around hours of usage on ubuntus powersaving mode sound quality the sound output is below average in terms of volume external bluetooth s read more
4,good laptop for multiprocessing tasks battery is also good but sometimes in between it makes noise when processor load increases
4,product is good considering the price i bought at k including yrs extended warranty with adp it takes hrs for initial setup after the restart an error occurred however i did a reset and now it is working fine cons fan running with humming sound even in low cpuram usage the keyboard could be a little broader to utilize the full space however youll soon get used to it ill update after a month
4,product is very good but delivery of product too late and also not good response from customer care
4,cons no microsoft office preinstalled sound from speakers low no fingerprint scanner good processor amd ryzen design is good battery life is good
4,the lap is value of money i didnt hear msi brand before my friend buy msi he suggested me this lap the overall performance is battery hrs display smooth look highly recommended for students and professionals
4,display design performance cannot game value for money only limitation is limited port availablity otherwise its the best laptop you can get under k though shopsy dont think too much go ahead absolute beauty
4,i am very very happy with this till now realme always osam
4,value for money product design and built quality is awesome it gives a premium feel a little bit disappointment is that you can not increase the ram

4,everything is good except the sound speaker sound quality and placement is very poor actually speakers are placed beneath which suppressed most of the output
4,beware audio is too low everything else is too good still recommended sound in the video is playing from bluetooth speakers from tribit
4,product is very good but speaker is very low quality msi
4,great laptop in the price range i got it for k a must buy for college students able to run all coding softwares
4,its a very good laptop in this range ive used it for like days only and it is good till now hoping it will remain good for the next few years a few issues which i encountered are that the speaker is having very very low sound you will definitely be needing an external speaker or a headphone to listen properly also the ms office is only for days youll be asked to pay for the annual subscription of the ms office now coming to space youll get around gb ssd read more
4,after using it for couple of weeks i am sure it is an capable laptop l have played apex legends in this laptop it runs smoothly with moderate heat it is absolutely valuable for money i issue though sound is not loud enough if you are using it for entertainment purposes then look for an external speaker
4,nice laptop i purchased the gb version thinking that gb will be enough but it always shows utilization above even if no app is running recommend version
4,good
4,upon receiving and thoroughly testing my recently acquired laptop i was impressed by its overall performance however there are several notable drawbacks that cannot be overlooked the included microsoft office subscription valid for only six months feels like a missed opportunity for a product aimed at professionals who rely heavily on productivity software during my testing i observed that the laptop tends to heat up noticeably even with just light browsing and multitasking read more

4,please improve speaker quality
4,performance tagara battery life tagara specially the lucky one for me i recovered my laptop money in just months

4,the performance of the laptop is very good multitasking also work very smoothly in this and some people say that games like free fire and battleground do not play well in it but it run very well when when in low graphics and its battery is in will give a star because the company has claimed hours while its battery last in normally use build quality display if the display was antiglare it would have been very nice trackpad and keyboard

4,ill be honest n critique this product as for it is the build is not premium it is just the finish n touch that looks premium but actually dont be a typical fan and observe that the display screen and the hinge are of poor quality which has a high amount of push n bending which is scary get asus lenovo samsung is just a brand name

5,overall good windows handheld gaming deviceat initial setup it is must to connect the charger connected to a ups because if power is disconnected in between setup we need to do the windows setup again its a different experience with the device the battery backup is average other than that theres no issues its not a problem for me thanks flipkart
5,best handheld devices battery is the only drawback
5,flipkart gave a lightning fast delivery to be honest was little bit nervous for this expensive thing its a portable pc within it superbly good for travellers who love gaming and for normal gaming stuff too pair it with a controller and its a pc that can be your playstation overall awesome recommend buying an sd card of tb so that you get seamless space for multiple beefy games
5,this has performed beyond my expectations if you are confused between steamdeck and rog ally go for this as this is all in one pocket gaming machine
5,i always wanted something like this for a long time and since steam deck is not officially sold in india this is the next best thing it can play all pc games with ease and you can play for hours if the charger is plugged in since its easy to hold the display and speakers are so amazing and i dont think you can find a gaming laptop for the same price that offers the same experience there were a few times i looked around the room to see where the sound was coming from yes the surroun read more

5,the product itself is amazing the only issue is that the os isnt optimised for a handheld console i hope that in the future we get more updates that streamline the os for a better experience performance is great no complaints there the battery life isnt a lot but its expected for the price ill recommend buying it only if you already have a laptop or a pc and a console if this is your first gaming device id recommend buying a playstation instead

5,in terms of performance just wow price is lil higher side performance is way higher than steam deck
5,an absolute beast of a handheld console i barely review products online but this one has really impressed me its absolutely crazy to see high end games run on a handheld and look and run this good most recent games comfortably run with medium high settings at p between fps the display is nothing short of amazing with sound quality to match by far the best sounding speakers ive ever heard on a portable handheld device the battery might be disappointing for most but is totally read more
5,very nice and excellent performance
5,worthy of k for playing almost all games on a freaking handheld this review is written after months of purchase definitely needs to be tinkered with for maintaining battery backup but can provide solid performance on demand i have started horizon forbidden west play through recently and it works albeit with some tinkering on settings buy a w power bankcable and you can almost x the battery life easily

5,product is good price is bit high sd card slot is worse but if we use sd card through otg type c it works but inbuilt sd card slot gives a problem highly disappointed by it performance is quite good if game is well optimised good for playing aaa titles presents till now not recommended for upcoming high end game titles
5,superb product go for it
5,as of now the device is performing as expected its absolutely a revolutionary hand held device except for the battery backup however it is recommended to buy it on sale as asus rog ally x is already launched also please note that you might get expired warranty status on registering the product you will have to upload invoice details to get a correct waranty status on asus website
5,other than the battery life i have not found any other issues can play everything i have thrown at it really impressed how such a small device can throw out so much of power also playing some games on low or medium settings does not hamper the quality of the games you can still play it on high settings but on this screen they all look good if you wanna conserve battery then do some tinkering find a mix of medium to low settings of games and then enjoy otherwise connect the charger go read more

5,the rog ally has its quirks which are well documented in all the expert reviews but as a first shot at a powerful handheld gaming machine it largely meets the expectations the ally needs thorough updating and some advanced fiddling initially but when it works it works well and given the flexibility of use it offers it is a product easy to recommend the extent to which you can customise your experience through the combination of windows and the armoury crate layer is impressive but the read more

5,best laptop for budget gaming experience its ryzen gb ram gb full hd display also cons fans both at right side of laptop when going ultra or lang hours gaming it starts heating all games are good with low or midium graphics setting with to fps max some old games like gta will get good fps but when you start with grid hellblade or ac origins and simillar you have to drop the settings to medium or low its a great laptop for very casual gaming peoples if you read more
5,its a cool and more useful for heavy users like gamers developeretc
5,excellent laptop my only concern is that one of the air exhaust is just opposite to the screen which gives hot air directly to an area on the lower bezel of screen i just hope that it doesnt create issue in long term battery life is around hours for daily work use when refresh rate is set to hz and it becomes hr when you do gaming on battery power display is ok but color accuracy is average

5,this laptop is awesomeit ticks every box of its category except the sound outputwhat i felt that its output sound is little bit lowapart from that aspect i will suggest to go for it
5,best for non coding students for online classes and simple use
5,very nice
5,i was completely satisfied with the product but the only issue i was facing is there is no sd card slot in this model so if u are a guy looking to extend your storage using sd card this model is not for you
5,the best for students i have another hp pavilion gaming and the performance is kinda similar when youre opening too many chrome tabs and using basic apps the pavilion is better only when youre doing coding and gaming but if youre just using for meet and browsing and content consumption this is more than adequate
5,excellent productgood performance features are similar like a android
5,this is the worst product i ever had it hangs a lot please consider once while ordering it
5,definetly a experience the battery backup is great compared to windows laptops as chromebooks have chromeos which is lightweight i had to deal with some minor issues and had to format it once i had turned on developer mode which was unstable so maybe it was the reason touchscreen works great overall its great and has value for money also in case you are comparing it with a laptop dont because it has a lightweight chip and cannot execute windows files so choose according to you read more
5,this product very good quality but display picture is totally bad i am very impress very happy to buy this item so thank you for flipkart radhe radhe

5,nice design and works great graphics card good entry level gaming laptop with decent hrs game time and large keyskeyboard msi centre takes time to setup but post that its nice the audio is poor as it depends on where the voice is coming from the browser or video or something else screen is clear and good support for light video editing
5,a brilliant laptop
5,absolute masterpiece
5,superb product
5,using for days good laptop for basic use case ram is upgradable processor is equivalent to core i and battery back up is pretty good display is anti reflecting
5,writing the review after used days from the delivery datesmooth performamce zero lag looks premium light wight keys are smooth for typing but doing little bit noise which little bit awfull but in this range its really a future prood laptop not providing acer charger s they providing thirs party charge go for it without hasitation in this budget

5,looks and design built n quality performance battery displa gaming price n value what a elegant beast at first i was sceptical as msi gaming laptops are not rated much or may be thin series is a new launch but after using it i can definitely say its a bang for your bucks the laptop is classy light n slim can be pretty much compared to professional laptops with minimal design n factor performance is pretty good one must update all the drivers n apps a read more

5,the price and material are convenient

5,very good laptop all students useful

5,very very good laptop
5,i bought this laptop mainly due to core ultra h processor and apparently these new processors are supposed to have better battery life and looks like it fulfills that to an extent battery lasts hours in battery efficiency mode and a bit less in balanced mode also depends on screen brightness as its oled screen display oled screen is really good but glare is there it can get bright enough picture quality is great but have to be wary if oled burnin issue arises in futu read more

5,really good laptop at this price using it from past week and all the cpu and gpu are working to its max limits which is really good pros gb ram with rtx w is superb for gaming and entry level editing cons speakers are bad not too bad as i read in the reviews battery backup is decent hrs on casual use and hours on gaming a good laptop which is useful for both gaming as well as work purposes at this decent price is smtg u need to look for
5,the product is worth for price and the audio is low because of the driverwe can fix it by installing third party audio drivers
5,just good but battery drains pretty fast due to graphic card
5,im a bit disappointed with the battery backup although it performs well in other aspects
5,laptop manufacturing date is not old it is made just months before our purchase date which is good since many a times products which are manufactured earlier are cleared during discount period laptop configuration is decent good for students and professionals however it is not meant for heavy gaming applications overall good product at this price and if bought at discount then even better
5,at this price point and performance this laptop is awesome for gaming i easily get fps on gta and fps on assassins creed valhalla im a bit disappointed that the new ryzen cpu doesnt have integrated graphics so it uses the dgpu all the time because of this the laptop only gets around hours of battery life in terms of display speaker and ram theres nothing to complain about the only thing you might need to do is upgrade the ssd to tb because only gb is usable read more

5,good leftop
5,wonderful product lve it after using
5,superb product high speed performance
5,fantastic initial impressions will see how it performs over the long term
5,the laptop is good got it for k during offer for that price its a good value laptop wish it had an igpu the battery is not that good even with hz it sometimes lasts hrs but as it is a gaming laptop so no issue with the battery much performance is top notch no complaints there and gb ram is cherry on top gaming performance is very good is totally worth it over so far only played god of war in medium to high settings with fps capped it varies from read more
5,at this budget the best laptop for sure provides rtx with ryzen prosdesign build quality is very good and hands free to use best for productivity gaming video editing handles k editing cons it doesnt have igpu so it gives less battery backup which comes at like hrs and yeah at this price they should give rgb keyboard its disappointment but overall best laptop u can go for it will update after some days of usage
5,one of the best lappy in this price segment only one thing is missing that is backlit keyboard
5,nice product impressive
5,best best best
5,overall product at this price is the best i think in terms of performance one thing that is very misleading is not giving much information about the processor ryzen hs processor has no integrated gpu this means that is always turned on which contributes to better performance but awful battery life the battery life is not good in my usage when i was watching just a live stream on silent mode and power saving with hz i got hours of battery which is not that good as we sho read more
5,its a great product in terms of performance its actually value for money product its battery life is not that great but i got hrs on balanced mode therefore you can buy this product
5,very good laptop with gb of ram no other brands are offering this good design recommended for those who is looking for budget laptop with performance go for it
5,good but battery is not g
5,great performance quick response the only con it has is its battery which is only w which can give up to hrs of battery back up on video play with mid brightness wish it had a w battery otherwise it is a great device and i am loving it
5,top class
5,its beauty and the beast both heat management is very very good go for it guys
5,great prod

5,gaming laptop review pros performance runs all games on ultra settings with high fps thermals stays cool and quiet during long sessions display vibrant sharp and smooth with a high refresh rate build quality durable and premium with a comfortable keyboard value great features at a good price backlit keyboard easy to use in low light connectivity plenty of ports including usbc and hdmi upgradability easy to upgrade ra read more
5,the lenovo loq arp seems to be a solid choice for us gamers on a budget the thermals are good enough when i was playing god of war on high setting the fans threw air like a jettgp is w which is great the only catch is theres no igpu ie rtx will always be used for display which shortens battery life hrs overall the laptop is great highly recommended
5,got this in the bbd sale and it excels in all the criterias what i was expecting amd ryzen does all the work buttery smooth and the rtx provides the cherry on the cake no complaints with that screen is awesome and still i havent found any much bugs with the system and i wont comment on the battery backup as its an hs processor so you cant expect it to provide hours of backup so yeah im getting around hrs of battery backup and besides that the power break charges it fastly coming read more
5,good product got at a great value for money in goat sale
5,good laptop with good graphics and battery
5,excellent gpu performance game playable at ultra graphics fine structure and give gaming console feeling the main problem is battery life
5,good laptop overall battery life could be better performance wise no issues camera quality is just ok build quality is decent keyboard has white backlight sound could be a little louder flipkart packing wasnt good enough it seems like they have thrown the package while handling it through courier i have got it via flipkart sale for k one more con is it doesnt have integrated gpu the power adapter heats a lot more than usual i have bought it for video editing and little bit gaming read more
5,great product and it is a value for money product i have a suggestion dont buy the blue colour one u oly get hz display buy the mica silver laptop u will get hz for the same priceand and i telling u hz is very smooth literally like butter
5,very very nice product but made in china it can beat i laptop so please buy

5,i recently purchased the lenovo loq gaming laptop and im incredibly impressed with its performance for the price its a fantastic option for gamers looking for a solid machine
5,the performance of this laptop is top
5,asom product
5,everything is good but the chief complaints are plastic body acer makes metal laptops for quite cheap price bad speakers too low volume asus rog has best speakers i have heard so far in a laptop bad battery my old acer which is almost years old has better battery backup than this rest all is good the best part is the screen looks almost like amoled performance is very good advise look for rog strix g as a second option
5,best gaming laptop ever its a beast and you can go for it if you have budget gameplay is very smooth in all the games which ever i tried and there is no lag at all
5,charger not worky

5,a value for money chromebook with a decent enough configuration there is sw update support till or so with gb ram and gb ssd it should last for that period for those who use this mainly as consumers for a student on computer science course this can do for the most part except for heavy gpgpu or npugpu stuff for those who create stuff be it coding or multimedia this can be used in a pinch if needed but ideally a more powerful configuration will be better

5,just awesome product at this price speed is pretty good better than other product in the same range
5,wooo hoooo a very good product in this range i loved it
5,excellent quality and excellent product while using it i have been used more than months performance was good build quality was good keyboard experience was good every one say it has heating issue but i will tell you one thing is it got metal body build than regular laptops competition so it shows much heat while touching the back surface due to that i have been using asus too same configuration it also dissipates heat one thing i found my new wireless mouse was not detecting it
5,awesome product at this price point it is the best laptop so far pros awesome display decent battery life hours camera led light is a unique feature and serves its purpose backlight keyboard at this price quick boot up seconds light weight nice built quality cons sometimes power button needs to be press times to boot
5,except the touchpad placementsize you will like everything about this laptop one more thing is the lights near the camera is worthless and appears cheap it doesnt lighten up your face but the room
5,after using one month heavily in office work this i laptop can hold pretty much like team meetings some industrial design tools multitasking for research analysis etc no questions about battery up to hrs on heavy load which is okay for me design but one thing the camera quality is bit poor but manageable i can say if you are running tight with your wallet you can pick this new comer thanks
5,nice product go for it blindly its screen quality is awesome at this price point because it has srgb and a lcd panel in which viewing angle are surprisingly good battery backup is around hours at moderate usage backlit keyboard is awesome speakers quality is decent bass is missing slimmest laptop as claimed by infinix charging is pretty fast it tooks hours to charge smooth experience and its better for day to day normal usage highly recommended for those read more
5,its very slim which i prefer all the time just those camera and camera lights are useless as usual but it looks pretty just for show off overall performance is much more better at this price segment no one can defeat this laptop at this price range if you look a completely silver panel performance backlit keyboard windows portabilityi dont found any debug till the date after all its depends upon how you run with that device and moral of the story definitely go for it dont think twic read more
5,i give good experience
5,best and pocket friendly laptop must buy for programming and development purpose long battery life work for last hour with heavy app

5,ideal for your small needs at a low price one drawback is that the screen is small but you can rest assured that the price is low works with focus on google chrome so the tea you get on the tester or laptop when using other browsers features not available this is similar to what a typical mobile browsing application looks like when set to desktop mode

5,the deep midnight color is striking and adds a touch of elegance the viewing experience is truly remarkable providing vivid and immersive visuals its suitable for standard video and photo editing tasks however for users engaging in intensive video editing it is advisable to choose the gb storage option due to the slower ssd speed of the gb model overall considering the features and performance at this price point its a compelling deal

5,first gaming laptop i purchased and i must say it is amazinggg build quality is great and the new refreshed rtx makes games go butter smooth i was getting fps on high setting and dlss on performance hellblade senuas sacrifice which is gpu intensive game only the battery capacity is on lower end but is expected from this gaming laptop like this one
5,value for money about battery my opinion is its good according to uses build is performance other things like speaker they loud and clear if u want to much sound then buy dj setup
5,the lenovo loq is a good budgetfriendly gaming laptop that offers good performance for the price however the battery life is average but you can expect average battery life from a gaming laptop if you want a laptop that lasts hours get a macbook
