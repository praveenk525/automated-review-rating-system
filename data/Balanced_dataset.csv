1,very bad product it hangs frequently
1,i couldnt wait to get this top in the mail since they didnt have it at my local retailer but i was so disappointed in both the quality and fit the white is completely seethru i cant believe how sheer the material is especially for the price even as the shirt is lying down i can see through both layers of it the fit runs small and short
1,i bought a pair of these a month ago and first time i washed them they came out with light spots all down the leg i figured i did something wrong so i bought another pair in the same color and one in sage just washed both pairs according to care instructions no spills stain remover or anything but detergent and both came out with light spots all down the leg very sad to have wasted all that money
1,after reading the previous review i was pretty confident in ordering this dress it arrived in the mail today and i was so disappointed first of all its huge the medium was way too big on me and im never a small at retailer i even considered ordering the large in this my normal size at retailer second the colors are not as vibrant as in the photo and the fabric felt cheap finally it just looked like i went to hawaii and bought a drab dress there that didnt fit right
1,very bad product battery drains out in minutes raised a complaint for replacement no response for days only dates given for resolution never ever buy this third class product
1,top is completely see through i cant imagine if it were to get wet what it would look like it is a cute design but not practical at all
1,dont be fooled by the photos online the color is a bright baby blue not pale blue its a beautifully designed dress however the material is so bulky and heavy its so unflattering i was afraid to try it on and my fears came true this dress just hung on me and pulled me down i wanted so much to love it but i returned it
1,as a tim burton and the addams family fan i was so excited for it and i am so disappointed by this show where is the gothic icon morticia addams dark humor where is the romantic gomez addams where was tim burton in it i mean beetlejuice edward scissorhands big fish how come it is his work i mean after more than years its not even half as good as beetlejuice where is tim burtons set design i felt like it was supposed to be a thriller but its not thrilling at all actors none of them are even as good as any actor in any other tim burton movies if you read it until here you know that i dont recommend it at all
1,dont buy the product went to blur just after starting in few seconds
1,i expected this episode would get lower ratings than the first two eps primarily thanks to knuckledragging homophobes passing off their prejudice as insightful commentary on the cons of straying too far from the source material or some other garbage excuse for why their bigotry is preventing them from enjoying one of the best episodes to date one of the best episodes ive seen on television for awhile some of the absurdly low reviews claimed this episode was just a filler or this didnt happen in the game or not enough action and zombies where r all the zombies for the love of godyou muppets rating this masterpiece of an episode with a pitiful are the zombies thats where the freaking zombies are a video game is a video game and a television show is a television show these are both drastically different storytelling mediums a lot of folks are missing the point of an adaptation the shows writers and creators have done an impeccably superb job of taking a story from one medium and turning it into this masterpiece were seeing unfold here episode surpasses all my expectations for what strong world building theme building character building should look likewere here to explore all the facets of humanity including love and what that looks like in a dystopian wasteland the writers are giving us the content from the video game yesbut theyre also giving us so much more this show is what television as a medium should strive fortheyre doing what so few have managed to achieve this show is what storytelling is all about if you just want a show about zombies and action and nothing else yawni dunno dudes maybe this show and its more nuanced mature themes just isnt for you
1,i tried on an xs and it was boxyroomy in the torso and the pocket on the wristforearm area made my arm look too bulky when i rolled the sleeves up like the model pictured i love the idea of a relaxed fit cropped leather jacket in a versatile taupe color but when i tried this one on in person it took me back to my childhood i used to help my dad wash his cars when i was a kid and he used a leather chamois shammy for short that was awesome for soaking up water and thats what it felt lik
1,ordered the biggest size available the large the arms are so tight i couldnt get it on looked like it may have fit in the body so i dont understand why so constricting in the arms i dont have big arms either fabric is thin but the color is pretty cant recommend id pass on this one
1,i really loved the way this shirt looked on me its forgiving and flattering and really lightweight the fabric however couldnt even withstand half a days wear without snagging times and developing a hole right in the center i have no idea how this happened as i wasnt wearing or near anything that could have pulled at it such a shame this could have been a staple wardrobe piece for me
1,super product thanks to flipkart
1,within a day got blue screen error even in trouble shooting didnt detecting hardisk it might me harddisk issue i dont recommend this laptop issue not resolved just kept under observation for days if again issue raise then then we give the effective certification
1,the good the sloths are cute because sloths are always cute now the bad the material is wretched it feels damp even when its not its see through and unlined its scratchy and wrinkly and though the cut of the dress would be fine the fabric is so limp that the highlow hem looks more like a tail i wanted to like this but charging nearly dollars for a see through piece of awful fabric with a passable cut was simple not acceptable i returned it as fast as i possibly c
1,does taste of home not publish negative reviews this cake was a disaster for me today i used inch pans and the cake came out over the top and spilled into the oven i followed the recipe to the letter but i think it should have been baked at degrees rather than and perhaps part of the batter should have been used for cupcakes as described if one used the inch pans too much batter for inch pans
1,stopped working after days i shut it down an hour ago when i opened it again neither it is charging nor it is turning on
1,its too hang and dont work properly
1,these are genuine sandisk memory cards but from a defective batch i lost all of my photos and videos taken on my phone over the last two years because the card had a catastrophic failure sandisk reps informed me the batch was bad and they were aware of the problem
1,perhaps your idea of fun is to be to be surrounded by people that you dont like who are annoying then this is the program that is for you if you have been wanting that vacation from hell then youve come to the right place the white lotus if you like a series that insults your intelligence while leaving your emotions behind then you will enjoy this the characters of the series are cardboard silly and without merit its something like a farce from fantasy island but without the cleverness if you like to be grossed out then this is for you life can be dismal enough people can be stupid in real life we dont need to spend time with them on tv or maybe you do
1,verry slow working dont buy this products
1,battery not good recommended by hours or a daybut its run only or hours only and key pad worst quality
1,i really wanted to love the shorts when i read that the shorts were lined i expected them to be lined so that my underwear didnt show even though the shorts are lined you can see through the fabric completely this was absolutely disappointing since the shorts have a lovely exterior design pockets and comfortable waistline im returning the shorts as well
1,wow kevin costner is awesome i mean i watched his many movies every time he surprise me with his acting i just love how he plays john dutton in this show perfectly and kelly reilly amazing actress she has played beth dutton character in this show very well i just love her acting

1,display is very poor
1,low quality
1,this dress really was huge and not at all flattering i dont know how they got it to look good on the model in the picture material was nice and soft but i really dont see how anyone could look good in this no matter what your body shape is
1,horrible recipe i am actually quite surprised it turned out so horribly i spent on all the ingredients and almost knew it would turn out amazing due to all the great reviews and five star rating there was not nearly enough sauce to call it lasagna the flavors were way too strong and the pork sausage was the wrong choice there was also not enough lasagna noodles in this recipe so many things i didnt like about this dish what a waste of food and time dont waste your time
1,wow after such a brilliant first season the first six episodes left me wondering what happened to the story line did the writers just regress to high school level creativity what we have in season is boring over done drama with uninteresting characters and very little action or plot actors need a good story line and creative writing to work with but here i dont see anything for the actors to work with i enjoy well choreographed action scenes without all the gci but for the last six hours of air time andor is all about the cgi and very little action the writers failed to develop a complex and engaging story line that the audience could follow time jumping from one year to the next breaks season way to much for me to hold together just what is the main plot is all about and it is just too confusing like a puzzle missing pieces
1,the armholes on this dress are totally bizarre i cant believe no one else has commented on them yet i am a size s on top and m on the bottom so i usually try on both in dresses i tend to be a small size in retailer the armholes are so long that the dress doesnt lay right on top i showed it to on of the clerks in the store and she agreed with me we looked at all the others and they were the same going up a size made it way worse this dress might work for someone with really broad shoul
1,i was only a real fan of the original and have lost interest gradually with every movie there after but now i have a new hope the star wars of my youth has returned thank jon favreau
1,unfortunately this top is shirtlength and im only needs to be about longer made of sweatshirt material which i wouldnt mind if it were longer also runs very wide ordered an xs and could have gone smaller
1,sometimes while using just stop responding keys stop working suddenly get paused worthless
1,such worst performance and bad experience of flipkart platform
1,i ordered the coralpeach version in size it ran small especially compared to other size or maeve blouses ive purchased very tight throughout the blouse the product photos looked so nice compared to what arrived the material was extremely cheap in quality it wrinkled terribly the bow pulled the material down which obscured the look of the eyelet the idea of this was perfect for my style unfortunately the poor choice in material poor fit made this a return for me
1,laptop is not optimize with th gen h processer it consumes too much battery after using balance mode also some time stuck during task
1,extremely disappointed while it was tasty i added oregano and garlic to the sauce it came out a wet mess since i drained the meat mixture well and used sauce right from the can without adding water all i can think is minutes isnt nearly long enough to saltdrain the zucchini which i pressed to drain in the strainer and then squeezed in a towel
1,im a longtime fan of star wars but the mandalorian raises the bar and gives fans something to love i was actually skeptical of the show i usually want lightsabers and jedis in my star wars stories but after watching the first episode i was hooked now i am episode down and eager for more the cinematography amazing great variety in locations keeps it interesting and its cool to see familiar things from star wars that keep reminding me its star wars even without lightsabers and such acting is way above average and that is with a lead wearing a helmet which could have been silly but so far it is not a problem at all the cgi is honestly amazing for a series most of the cgi would have been good enough for a big blockbuster movie another positive they did as many things as possible with practical effects and its just a way better experience than for example the prequels were every other scene felt like a bluescreen the mandalorian so far has a great and interesting story and i cant help but think if jon favreau the creater of the mandalorian had he made solo that movie could have been so much better the mandalorian so far is an amazing show and i highly encourage any star wars fan to see it
1,my husband and i didnt like it because of the flour tortillas should use corn tortillas he thought bottom tortillas were hard from the baking i had leftovers next day and the tortillas were mushy pretty gross also it bubbled over onto the bottom of my oven the last minutes uncovered in an x pyrex

1,what an adorable and frustrating skirt im not a large person d and i ordered my normal size small this is a pull on skirt and the waist opening could not accommodate either my shoulders or my hips in most retailer clothes im either a size or i have to agree with the other reviewer there is no way to put this item on

1,i dont typically write bad reviews but this dress is so bad and i want to save someone else from buying it i read the mostly bad reviews and still purchased anyway my fault i know the dress is super stiff i know denim can be that way and it is possible it would soften up after a few washes im typically a and the size small swallowed me and the xs was big everywhere except through the bust i ordered both sizes to try i wouldnt recommend buying this if you are a size or small
1,the first season is one of the greatest shows ever made alan ritchson is awesome its got a really good balance of mystery detective and hardcore violence its a much watch if you like action or detective shows i came to review the second season which falls very short of the first season its got no mystery flat fight scenes character development that goes backwards its just a massive boring flop they are expecting to get views based on the good work the first season layed down and its just plain lazy i feel ripped off and have cancelled my prime subscription so disappointed by prime in they had some great shows in the past but recently its devolved into lazy writing and sub b grade acting reacher is another victim of their previous success gone are the days of great shows like man in the high castle the expanse the boys etc etc its starting to feel like the asylum has taken over its that bad hopefully enough people unsubscribe so prime are forced to stop being so lazy at time of writing this im at episode i dont think its got enough legs to get me to watch the finale im soo bored with this season i just cant muster the energy to sit through the predictable conclusion theres just nothing left in the plot material if theres a big action scene it will be incredibly contrived because the season has run out of legs about episodes ago boring
1,i have been a walmart plus member for years now and well how this all played out has really left me in shock due to their errors and failure to fulfill my orders they have closed my acct due to me refusing to pay for items i didnt receive before i moved to my new place i rarely had any issue with the walmart delivery but once i moved it seemed like every order there was more and more items missing
1,i sat on a comfortable chair took a cup of tea and sat watching the sun go down on star wars the night felt lonely and long yet there is a new day again the sun rises even more brighter this time bringing life bringing joy for the first time i look forward to see the end of an episode with amazing still graphics and the soulful music by ludwig a must watch for every star wars fan i have spoken

1,i truly cannot understand the great reviews on this dress i purchased in both a sp and a mp i am the mp fit perfectly i definitely wouldnt keep it though because it looks like someone sewed a bunch of old sweatshirts together its not super soft coarse on the inside and feels old the back is longer than the front it just looks like something my daughter would make in sewing class out of scraps even with leggings and great boots it looks worn

1,i wanted to love this couldnt wait for it to arrive unfortunately it doesnt look anything like the picture i usually wear a ml in holding horses so i ordered a l but as soon as i held it up i noticed it was ridiculously large the fabric is on the heavy side so the dress just hangs in a very unflattering way and it is extremely shimmery i love velvet but the texture and sheen of this dress was just over the top sadly it is going back

1,not useful at all waste of money
1,i loved the photo of this dress upon examination of the dress and trying it on after receiving in the mail the dress shown online is nothing like the dress i received save for the pattern the dress i received has a side zip as well as a belt and no pleats on the top the bottom is also cut straight across not as it appears in the photo turns out it is not as flattering as it should appear
1,not even worth one star bring out a lot of white stuff had high expectations but this product is a total failure and waste
1,the cut and color of the dress is awesome however the biggest flaw is the zipper i only got to wear this dress once until the zipper brokesad day especially at the price there also were a number of loose threads i recommend waiting until it goes on sale youll want the extra money for a tailor to fix that zipper

1,i really wished i had heeded the other reviews of this dress it is so ridiculously oversized i cannot imagine who this possibly would look good on i ordered the smmed and when i took it out of the package i thought i had accidentally been sent a bed sheet and said are you kidding me by the time you cinch the neckline so the fabric is somewhat close to your body the neckline is almost to your waist and you look lbs heavier horrible design retailer i dont know which dress the

1,i loved the print and fabric of this dress when i first saw it but trying it on was a very different story the photo seems to show a wider more welldefined waist with just a small amount of blousing on top but this was not the case yes the waist fit but it is a narrow band that was covered completely by the hanging over of the illfitting top turning the entire look into a shapeless and very unattractive fit sadly this is going right back

1,i purchase this top of what i thought to be a beautiful denim tunictop in a small on the sale rack with additional promo with beautiful details but what is going on with the midsection where there is at least inches of space where there is no button or way to close the lower placket and the lower bottom of placket is sewn shut so it makes the mid section bubble out but why no buttons to close what would be a button down top you can slide your hand through this open space and it ope

1,not at all good product

1,the skirt that i received had very little blue or green in it and was mostly white yellow and some red the fit was fine but the quality for the price was not there for me the lack of quality and the disappointment in the quality equals a return
1,battery is not work properly
1,not certain what others have done that i have not but this was the most useless recipe i have ever utilized too thick burns on top and sides and raw in the middle i even tried adding more applesauce so it would not be like cooking wallpaper paste in the trash it went and going back to my old recipe

1,very poor powerbackup work is very slow
1,these run very small they are also short almost like a crop pant the fit was so weird that i wont even exchange for a bigger size
1,i love the idea of this top but there is just way too much fabric involved in person im and usually wear a small or medium to accommodate a fuller chest i ordered a small and it fit fine around the chest but the huge swing hem combined with the slightly stiff fabric is just enormously unflattering i feel like they could have made about shirts out of it i think the picture must have it pinned a ton in the back the silhouette is nothing like shown if there were just less fabric i wo
1,just months very less usage display gone
1,this coat is awful just awful i bought it based on the reviews my husband said it looks like i am wearing a mattress it looked awful i really really liked the softness and that it wasnt like another puffer coat it was also stretchy and the buttons super easy to wear but the look style and design make it very unflattering it looked so bad that i took it off right away so disappointing
1,very bad laptop dont buy
1,i understand they want to criticize how rich white people wasted their lives but it should be a story not an caricature grotesque of insignificant people the purpose of a tv series is to entertain not a documentary of boring facts of live makes even despite thailand if we have to meet those boring souls not going for season to be sure with that kinf of thinking lots of missed opportunities here to critized in positive manner the goals and purposes of people but instead lazily showing what no people are willing to know sincerely about unsound people with lot of mental problems to be resolved cannot identify and totally indiferent with any of these characters so not interested to follow that series anymore
1,its really nice to actually have a character that fits the profile of reacher big strong serious sensitive and smart also humourous in a non dry humor way
1,it has a major issue of wifi cardnot connect to wifi quickly also the net speed has drastically decreased when connected to the wifi in many asus tuf laptops it has a defective wifi card this one reason is enough to avoid it

1,i found this to be a rather horrible recipe the pankcakes came out very thick would not brown correctly and were quite tasteless what a waste of good ingredients
1,battery low
1,this series had great potential but seems to have lost its heart and direction who i thought was the main character geralt now seems to be a milk toast supporting character what happened the show runners and writers are not good enough to manage so many sub plots the story is so fragmented it became boring its now reduced to the level of willow and rings of power ive heard all the rumors and rhetoric about henry cavill leaving because of the storyline not being true to originals and although i havent read the original material its obvious something is amiss im viewing this without any expectations and still find disappointment in the last two seasons especially season
1,after using it for days some error is coming in it and laptop is not starting and is restarting over and over again
1,well if you hear patriarchy is being mentioned in every episode you know what to think of this show and who the target audience is has nothing in common with the addams but rather twilight meets harry potter also grown ups playing teenagers juvenile characters and artificial dialogues to please a young audience this wednesday is the opposite of the original character originally she was supportive of her family not an aggressive hateful and opinionated brat like here no wonder addams fans are disappointed with this one they have taken some aspects of the addams in order to produce some hybrid story
1,this card no longer is readable by three different phones after only six months of very light usage very few pictures had been saved to the card where it was never taken in or out of the phone before it showed signs of dying thus the death was not caused by excessive handling of the card
1,i rarely write a really negative review and retailer is my favorite store ever but this dress is awful i ordered the black and white the fabric is very poor quality the colors are washed out i almost didnt try it on but i did and found that for me the fit was terrible though some of the reviewer pictures are cute
1,i kept asking my girl friend if this was a comedy after she put this on randomly episodes in and all i had was questions like is this funny or who finds this funny when dad finds drugs and prescription drugs with his yo daughter then laughed it off and carried on talking about his baz i went to bed i stubbed my toe on the way and that was way funnier than this i kept asking my girl friend if this was a comedy after she put this on randomly episodes in and all i had was questions like is this funny or who finds this funny when dad finds drugs and prescription drugs with his yo daughter then laughed it off and carried on talking about his baz i went to bed i stubbed my toe on the way and that was way funnier than this
1,i absolutely love the dark gritty tone the series maintains im sure we all see ourselves in one character or another wednesday adams consistently spews out with funny and sarcastic comments which really add to the show and ive picked up some vocabulary which intern will help with my writing the character progression is good yes wednesday still remains quirky and sarcastic dark but she also really does progress from an isolated emotionless being to well i like to say oyster i say this since oysters have pearls inside which so does wednesday she finally cares about others and the last fight really proves this i find the script and acting to be excellent executed with sheer brilliance if you havent already jump on the hype train and watch this show because you wont regret it
1,worst product dont buy this laptop this laptop had inbuilt problem or shutdown dont waste your money buy some other laptops
1,at the dinner are all members at the duttons family beautiful scene without discuss family business costner as like john dutton is marvelous rip brings much originality keeping the pace brisk and mix of bullets blood songs and bourban beth is a gorgeous lady bird she knows everythink local law fathers law well i think i got yellowstone figured out still i watching yellowstone and take a walk around this place beth is right is there is a forest in america in better shape or more loved the answer is most definitely no in any decade the series yellowstone bevy of explained details dropped subplots paperthin characterizations and frightfree mayhem would inspiration restecpa to all cast and crew
1,battery problem
1,wow this is huge im all for the tentlook with the right style but this was absurd i could have fit two of me into the width and with the peplum style extra width doesnt flatter anyone the fabric is also so thin that it doesnt hang nicely it kind of floats around the body if you want a wide top then this is perfect but if you wanted something that hangs nicely look elsewhere i purchased a petite s my typical size
1,lag problems mostly happens while gaming
1,this shirt had an overpowering vinegar odor when i took it out of the packaging the mint green color was appealing but the styling did not look good and the smell was too much
1,this top is quite boxy and i was very disappointed with the color it looked as if id washed it in filthy water its a very dingy white needless to say it went back
1,i was so excited for this to arrive at the end of last summer my favorite shirt you know the kind dresses up or down with ease its your go to for work or a night out with friends was ruined and i have been searching for the perfect replacement i thought that this would be a good contender but i was ever so disppaointed when i opened the bag firstly the base color is not accurately represented in the photograph in person its more of a peachy offwhte instead of white still pr
1,i absolutely loved this top it fit great and was easy to dress up or down i wore it once and washed it according to the tag cold water and flat dry it is now sizes too small and unwearable extremely disgusted
1,battery problem and hang all time inner box not a brand box normal box its a cheating
1,sound quality is not good
1,too bad and too sweet
1,unfortunately i felt like this recipe had very little taste i wont be making it again
1,i received this top in the mail today not what i expected at all it is a great fabric just way too much of it it is proportionally incorrect width wise unfortunately this one will be going back
1,failed in my galaxy note after monthslost all my pictures and videos that werent backed upthe card worked fine until suddenly wasnt being recognized on the phone or the computersandisk honored the warrenty and sent a replacement and it works but i am less confident about the product and afraid to lose data on it in later when im not prepared
1,this is one of those basic items that usually just work in my case i received one that just did not work a couple of weeks ago my phone reported an error and so i reformatted the card and transferred my music back onto it unfortunately it failed again two days ago and it wont even format now i have had good luck with sandisk before but this one was not a good experience
1,lovely colors and print my problem with this dress was that the bust was on the smaller side it will fit those with a smaller chest nicely and worse the beading on the bodice was attached with black thread which showed through the sheer netting layer on top for the price this particular detail should have been addressed
1,display very poor there is a display bleeding problem
1,defective product is delivered by flipkart screen is black while keyboard is on after startso bad experience i am facing with flipkartso i recommend all of you not to buy any product from flipkart please avoid purchase any goods from the flipkart platform
1,top opens in the middle right in front should have some sort of closure inside to prevent this top from flying open will return
1,absolutely horrible cake recipe ive been baking for a long time and this has to be the worst cake recipe ive ever tried a total waste of ingredients i followed the recipe to a t didnt over mix over fold and it had the worst texture very dense and almost gummy feeling i wish i could give this stars this is the first time ive been truly disappointed by a recipe on this site
1,im which is supposed to be the max height for pieties in retailer former employee and while the bodice hit right the skirt was insanely long not even with heels is this gonna be right and no discount towards hemming ill wait until this hits the sale rack which it will because concensus is its way too long
1,fail followed the recipe to par but the bread didnt rise at all not sure what eent wrong but the flour didnt rise before or during baking any suggestion or idea why
1,product is good but flipkart teach some patience to deliver person delivery person behaviour are not good
1,i loved the color and design until i tried it on in the store i am with a slender build i tried my usual xs but couldnt manage to put this shirt on me without risking smear my makeup or scratch my face by the elastic band at the neckline the band is so small even fully stretched out i have a normal sized head just in case you wonder i gave up after wrestling with it i can only imagine how uncomfortable to wear something with a tight elastic band choking mefunny but not funny
1,i have made porcupine meatballs many times in my life but decided to look for something different i followed this recipe exactly and my husband and i found it almost inedible this was very disappointing
1,not a fan cup of flour created a stiff gloopy glue surely this must be an error i ended up adding some extra milk cream chicken stock just trying to make it a little more smooth it is extremely bland as well i added some garlic but would suggest adding some of that old bay others have suggested i seriously cant understand how this is award winning or how some people ended up with it being runny after adjusting the consistency of the sauce i was able to create a lasagna i added a little mozzarella to the top my youngest son thought it was good but not great probably best for those who prefer a bit of a bland palate
1,the plot of chasing a monster makes no sense but even despite that mostly the script is fairly ok too bad no one in the whole thing can act a lick ot at least any of the principals ortega has some great lines but oh man she cant act like at all they would be great in the hands of someone else ricci who was obviously amazing as a child actress apparently is permanently stuck in yellowjackets mode now even the costuming is the same wednesdays roomy is quite good as are some of the other sidekicks and danny elfman who i am a huge fan of this score is overall terrible as well except here and there theres some good bits on viola it feels like a cynical exercise to make a couple bucks honestly rewatch addams family values instead
1,i know im dating myself with this reference but in addition to the addams family lineage this show made me think of the cartoon daria jenna ortega as wednesday is like daria if she was sometimes evil and always drop dead gorgeous if i was years younger id camp outside of jennas house the show is very well done with lots of star power as well the revenge prank she pulls in the beginning sets the tone which seems to be dont mess with her as you will surely regret it catherine zetajones also shines as morticia addams one question however how does thing a disembodied hand see to get around lol
1,so disappointed beautiful dress in the photographs but the cut was incredibly strange loose and baggy through the top and midsection but tight around the buttock and thighs
1,product burst in transit
1,got it on sale for an incredible price the only way i am likely to upgrade from this is if they come out with a g size g is not necessary for my use but at i would be able to use it without worry of running out of space and put my entire mp catalog on it as wellupdate about months after i bought this and installed it in my galaxy s it started causing some trouble for my phone at first i did not realize it was the micro sd card causing the problem but it would occasionally have a status message saying something like unmount the sd card before removing it to avoid corrupting your data and eventually it didnt even recognize that there was a card in there at all i put the old gb card back in and it works fine put the gb card into the adapter and put it into the computers card reader nothing wouldnt read it at alli do back up my phone occasionally maybe once a month but lost everything every photo and video i had taken of my new kitten since i got her because of this it is very surprising since sandisk is usually quite reliable my wife has the same card in her phone we got them around the same time and hers is still working normally so farymmv but always back up your data regularly more than once a month if you are taking a lot of pictures and video
1,battery issues are the worst also at this price we expect good battery backup
1,spent over and the thing came fast and didnt work neither my computer nor my phone could read it or format it i have had plenty of memory cards so i know to unmount it with software odds are yours will be fine mine sucked
1,not working properly not value for money you will have to get subscription for using ms word ms excel please dont buy its product
1,the mandalorian is not great but its fun just like rogue one it does feel like star wars far more than episodes and why it tells a star wars tale without messing up the original characterstrilogy some fans were cheering when han and luke and company were returning for the sequels but i was dreading it their story was over their character arcs were done luke naive farmerwise powerful jedi han selfish rogueselfless hero by bringing them back you can only butcher them luke reboot them to square one han or freeze them as if theyve spent the last three decades doing the same stuff leia the mandalorian follows the story of a bounty hunter who is not boba fett avoiding another pitfall we see familiar factions and races fun side characters ig ugnaught nick nolte the sense of fun and adventure is there telling a fresh story in the star wars setting was that so hard the protagonist is flawed hes got that indiana jones quality where he is cool and competent but still struggles and fails and messes up which humanizes him and increases tension when he is in danger the overwhelmingly positive response to this competent series shows how star wars fans are far from unpleasable just keep it simple and respect the lore and the original characters better still stay away from them explore new factions and planets i actually groaned when in an episode the mandalorian landed on tatooine there is a whole galaxy to explore get creative and please dont try to tie this decent and enjoyable series to the sequel trilogy its like tying a cheeseburger to a dead possum cant possibly improve the possum but definitely spoils the burger
1,crashed lost everything thanks sandisk used in gsnot a solid product couple years worth of stuff gone in an instant
1,very very worst laptop not in worked keyboard not in worked left and right side speakers dead slow only application installed memory will be filled dont buy this product
1,did not work for me whatsoever the stripes were adorable but the piece just didnt fit like on the model the collar was practically choking me and the tie just didnt make my figure look the way it normally does aka i looked frumpy and chunky which im not going back
1,not happy about quality
1,battery is very poor condition
1,this is the tiniest blazer ive ever purchased in a size i usually wear an but sized up based on other reviews and it was still too small its very attractive but please size true to size
1,this turned out great i forgot to click on the rating stars i would have given this recipe stars
1,i loved the fit and vibrant color of this dress its loose and flows but doesnt look like a potato sack i wore it once and got a ton of compliments that said i hand washed it as the tag states then let it line dry and it shrunk to half its size i rechecked the tag and noticed that under the hand wash instructions it then states dry clean recommended boo so disappointed that i spend over for a dress i wore once
1,this is very large i normally am a sm and i took this in an x it is a beautiful dress in color and fit but picks up any stain and i have had to have it dry cleaned after every use
1,the amazing character development took me on surprise i never read the books or played the video games and i really liked it yet it was able to take my attention as a totally new viewer and that tells a lot the series ability to capture new audiences is fascinating and indicates that this will be a fantasy cult classic in the upcoming years the critics reviews are unrealistic this series is not intended to be the new game of thrones it is creating a world unique of its own that has its own tone which is very different from got i hope the producers listen to the fans cries of a new season
1,this is why i love star wars first episodes have me laughs chills heroic idealism and that feeling of being a kid again i go back to as a six year old with this fantasy im in love once more will see if this states a rating or if it goes up its darker than im used to with this franchise but at least no ewoks so far lol thank you to all who made this a reality
1,disappointed these are not bars this is a recipe for cake
1,battery backup is lowand facing frequent touchpad issues
1,ugh the fit of this dress is terrible what a beautiful dress though the material and the colors had so much potential but the fit is awful i ordered by regular size and the top was more or less ok if not a tad big but hip down was crazy tight that i couldnt even zip it without a ton of effort i dont think sizing up will help because then the top will be even bigger disappointing
1,writing a review after two months of use and the laptop has stopped working now its not booting up and trying to get assistance from asus still not helping the worst service please dont make the mistake of buying the laptop
1,hanging issuesspeakers make noise manufacturing defects
1,display quality is not goodvery bad quality very upset to take
1,i love the color block concept but this top was way too boxy the shirt was pretty much square and the top was super itchy too looks so cute online but nogo in person
1,i agree with the first reviewer exactly beautiful fabric and idea of dress looks stunning on model but huge and shapeless in person like a tent not at all what i expected when ordering a petite sadly has to be returned
1,this may be the worst memory card ive ever purchased and i have bought a lot of card over the years wish i had just stuck with my adata cardsfirst issue i lost a bunch of photos they just did not exist at all it was as if i never took them but since there was a large gap in the file names i know for sure i didof photos taken about in the middle just disappearedi could not even recover them using a deep scan toolive been shooting digital since the mid s and this is the first time anything like this has ever happenedthen there is the cheesy sd adapter the switch was so loose it switched to locked while i was taking picturesluckily the camera warned me that the card was read only after having already taken a bunch of shots that has saved without issuefinally i figured i could just use these in my samsung phones no such luck the second i put them in and took a photo i got an error that it could not right to the card and i could no longer see the gig of photos that were on ityes this may be a know issue with the cards i see a review mentioned that and i see that sandisk will replace them but they cannot replace the photos i lost so keep that in mind when considering this card i will
1,unfortunately does not look anything like in the picture looks like an oversized house robe i expected much more but was disappointed i am definitely returning it
1,over heating worsted products
1,i have worked more then systems worst experience with display not able to watch min regularly on jt
1,it has booting problem
1,i saw this dress in the store and loved everything about it they had an extra large i usually wear a large and i thought it would perfect with some leggings i tried to get the dress over my chest but no chance my sister who wears a medium tried to put it in too and she couldnt fit it past her chest either we flipped it inside out and couldnt find a zipper maybe the dress in the store was mislabeled but the bust ran very small its too bad it looked adorable and i was so excited to try
1,this is a disaster too long cooking waste of time and money
1,i ordered these because of the side zipper but they zip in front even though the order listing and bag label called them wine side zip pants they were also at least two sizes larger than marked and very flimsy material what bothers me is that i was charged to send them back even though the product description and the name before someone changed it on the website were wrong
1,the engine of the breathing movement just way too loudthat cant be right could a defective model be sent also that the slumber otter was only packed in a bag without a carton seemed to me unscrupulous

1,no windows its just like another mobile
1,dont but if use word or execell more
1,bought the gold pair and dripped something on them so spot cleaned them with water only my white washcloth turned bright yellow the food came out but surrounding area was super faded so i returned them took the second pair home wore them a few times they stretched out so much washed them in cold water and they have splotches that are really light these pants are way too much trouble
1,p fps or p fps or fps using the nokia camera app or regular app doesnt work well it does but unless you want to see stuttering every seconds it freezes up constantly very glitchy because its slow got a mbs write mbs read on mine
1,for anyone who thinks this recipe looks good dont be deceived for me it looks like vomit and it tastes the same even substituting real cheese for that velveeta plastic cheese im sorry if i sound like a snob but velveeta is for those who have no idea what real cheese
1,worst product ever i have seen service of customer center is soooooooooo poor never buy this worst product im regreting buying this laptop build quality is soooo rd class
1,worst experience mousepad means cursor is not working
1,from the get go i could just feel this didnt have the same vibe as the first two seasons the plots were all thin the family vapid repeat of family in season the girlfriend group was a yawn and is chelsea someone thats really going to end with a rick character didnt feel like a soulmate coupling to me and sam rockwell just didnt fit into the storyline whatsoever what was mike white thinking lol at the beginning of ep i lost all interest in who was going to die because really none of the characters were very likeable at all a waste of time even lochy was very similar to the son in season who had a much more profound spiritual experience
1,its star wars damn right it has the atmosphere the looks the vibe the cinematography it has everything that star wars brought us throughout history welcome back sw

1,memory card failed mysteriously overnight not sure why but phone works fine with a different cardhere four more words
1,well i guess im pretty jaded i thought this was amusing watchable the cast members were likable the locations for seasons and were beautiful but i am just flabbergasted by the number of awards given to this series are we rating on a bell curve i think so this was very watchable and very streamable i stayed up very late getting to the end of the second season one night but i dont even know if ill remember it in a couple of years despite the debate about this it just seemed to me to be another hbo series about rich white folk doing whatever they please and sometimes agonizing about it i did not see this when it originally dropped but binged it after the end of the second season i enjoyed rita coolidge f murray abraham simona tabasco alexandra daddario beatrice grannò and a couple of others but basically i found this series to be a time filler as far as humor yes its lighthearted and i realize its more satire well is it but at most i found myself actually laughing not more than once an episode like i say i guess im jaded
1,i refused a living room set that they sent one week ahead of schedule i refused it while there was still one week left to the delivery date they brought it one week ahead of schedule and then charged me a shipping return and restocking fee saying it was the buyers fault it took walmart weeks and numerous phone calls to finally give me a refund of out of my return their customer service said i need to call their angi living room assembly service separately to get my assembly refund of this was inspite of the fact that angie sent me a cancellation email the day after i returned it saying walmart will refund me directly each walmart agent thereafter kept giving me different numbers to call angie when i finally called the right number no one picked up will never order anything from walmart again

1,spoke with customer service had it replaced times card had problems all of the times they were all the time looking for ways to get out of the warranty until they decided i did something which obviously wasnt the problem because it happened times with the previous cards basically look into other companies that honer their warrantiesvery sad usually very good cardsthey kept saying that samsung updated the software and they update it in ways that it wont match the sandisk cards

1,mediocre in every way worse its boring i like my series slow i like build up and character progression andor is boring no story no interesting characters lazy writing lifeless acting its all a bit if a drag eps in and nothing of note has happened i have no idea who the characters are nor do i care the group are on a planet for some reason i have no idea why nor do i care one chap spends the entire episode eating cereal while getting told off by his mum its like theyve taken all the worst bits of star wars sewn then together and the result us this god the acting is bad
1,i didnt have high hopes standalone movies were nice as theyve been set on unknown territory and in result we could be getting pretty much anything and i loved that it was a kingdom of catchie phrases debbie pastels funny cross overs and a bit of kids gore drop all your hope if your looking for this in burtons series as morticia i could forgive a lot but lack of quick and smart humor is just way too big pill to swollow sabrina oh sorry wednesday suddenly have feelings and learnes to have friends sorry not my addams story disappointing and quite flat and boring the netflix family filter is definitely not helping here such a waste of potential or maybe its one of those should never been touched

1,the buttons on the back are very tedious you will need someone to help you if you get past that hurdle then you have the look of a little girl in a smock way too big like a nightgown nice quality but not practical

1,very bad experience
1,looks great on the model but in actuality there is way too much fabric what should be flowy and billowy looks like a tent or a maternity top on a petite woman it didnt matter which size they all fit me disastrously i love the look and i thought of keeping it and having it taken in but theres too much fabric under the chest to make it an easy cutalteration on the side seams sometimes i wonder who comes up with these patterns and if they pin the shirts back on the models if you put a
1,this show is targeting a very specific slim demographic and we are not that demographic we are not a teenage latinx girl who is an outcast that lives in a world filled with people that do not look or act like them is it the addams family not even close this is not even a clever parody to the masterpiece film entitled the addams family directed by barry sonnenfeld which on a sidenote is qualified as a one of the best christmas movies ever it would have been enjoyable to see christina ricci reprise her role as wednesday but as an adult in the working world cleverly dealing with karens and susans
1,first i was little worried about the warranty process because when i enquired about this laptop on a shopthey told me that u wont get any warrnty if u buy it in flipkartsoi contacted the aus service center and they told me to go for it design wise it is very goodhave a large screen than other laptops thats pretty goodits a little heavierand also have good battery backuprgb keyboard is also stylishi have no doubt in processor performance cuz its amd i mainly brought it for a read more
1,the product which i order for new brand but the merchant are sailing refurbished lap just adding outfit with new parts but the interior and displays are not that much quality and efficient i really felt it was not worth in purchase through flipkart
1,i was so excited about this skirt and pairing it with a cute blouse for the warmer weather as i took out the skirt out of the package and flipped it around the back has mesh strips that are see through there is also no lining to go with this skirt if you go back to the back view picture on the website and zoom in closely you can see the models black underwear
1,i most be honest i was highly skeptic about this series when they announced it but after seen the chapter i can only say is a beautiful adaptation done with love and respect for the source material the acting is simply wonderful and the series has great pacing
1,very bad laptop i strongly say dont buy this product the colour of laptop also get detroit lagging problem is very high

1,good show but some flaws if you cant ride the horse stay home ive rode pretty great cutting horses on our ranch if your hand is on the horn someone is going to try to break it good riders never grab the horn let alone start with their hand on it ride the horse not the saddle taylor sheridan has a decent seat but if he needs the horn he isnt close to the best great program developer and excellent shows but he misses here just another rancher here i know we can be critical and i forgive a lot but this one i cant forgive oh by the way our ranch was established in no as long as some but not sold off and our family holds this one tight with no debt just blood sweat and tears and a heartfelt love of the land and animals on it never weaken is how we do it im th generation with more that follow not huge like the yellowstone or the four s but big enough for here
1,i watched this with interest but that waned over the course of the series ortega just didnt do it for me as wednesday never varying degrees of stone faced insults that became old very quickly i dont understand the appeal some have for her performance writing became very lazy towards the last three or so eps i could see the ending a mile away while interesting problems with suspense were immediately solved in the next scene by some secondary character just showing up with the solution gomez was visually accurate to the original comic but was not the right choice for this series i did not believe or feel the romance displayed by him and morticia by the two actors while fester was fun with respects to the scenes i never bought that character either he was played like a normal guy doing comedy with pale makeup overall the setting was just really off imo you have this regular small town surrounded by vampires werewolves and other oddities but none of the normals seem to care or be affected one way or the other the original movies were so good that they spoiled me
1,the touchpad and the cursor didnt work the first day what a mess
1,i have just finished season and gone back and rewatched the entire series again its only when you can watch it in quick succession do you realise how exceptional this show really is i have been a fan from day one and whilst you would not call this an enjoyable watch it is totally enthralling the characters the acting the storyline richness of the dystopian society meticulous thought in all of the small details is all faultless i genuinely feel like i am a part of what the characters are going through and this again is testament to the incredible acting cannot rate highly enough and am waiting with baited breath for season
1,waste laptop company india not performance wasted laptop no lights please dont purshed these laptop

1,sadly this has to go back i am lbs and this shirt is super short on me very short and its so wide its almost a trapeze cut the overall effect is ss style maternity shirt which is disappointing because the fabric is beautiful the detail is nice in person even the sleeve cuffs are great i am not very tall and im fairly thin on top so i can get away with a lot of styles loose and tight the combo of short and trapeze is just unflattering
1,waste
1,the fan is making too much noise and laptop heats up rapidly
1,love this series really gets you thinking if it actually happened great actors
1,i was really excited to make this soup after reading all the great reviews i have to agree with the one review i read that said it was basically hamburger helper without noodles actually i think hamburger helper tastes better then this the only change i made was to add a some bacon at the end my husband and i did not care for this at all

1,do not buy this dress for full price the design looks great but after receiving the dress the material is made of extremely cheap slinkyish polyester that you would find at a f store the stitching is horrific and created an uneven hump on the back seam just absolutely poor poor quality

1,the series wednesday directed by tim burton for netflix is a modern and gothic reinterpretation of the character wednesday addams the daughter of the famous addams family the plot follows wednesday played by jenna ortega as she transfers to nevermore academy a boarding school for outcasts where she uncovers mysteries linked to her family and her past pros jenna ortegas performance jenna ortegas portrayal is the highlight of the series she perfectly captures the essence of the character sarcastic intelligent and with a touch of macabre humor gothic atmosphere tim burton creates a unique aesthetic with sets and costumes that evoke classic gothic style and the surreal charm of the addams family supporting characters beyond wednesday many supporting characters such as thing and her roommate enid add depth and dynamism to the story engaging mystery the storyline is enriched by a blend of mystery fantasy and light horror making the series captivating soundtrack the music composed by danny elfman perfectly complements the dark and whimsical tone of the show cons inconsistent pacing some episodes are less engaging than others with moments where the narrative slows down or becomes predictable stereotypical characters some secondary characters eg bullies or rivals feel overly clichéd and underdeveloped comparison with the original for fans of the classic addams family this reinterpretation might seem too focused on wednesday sidelining the other family members teen drama elements the teen drama aspects might not appeal to those who prefer a darker and more mature approach predictable mystery despite the intriguing plot some twists are predictable for viewers wellversed in mysteries and thrillers conclusion wednesday is a series that skillfully combines dark humor mystery and teen drama while not perfect it entertains thanks to its unique aesthetic a charismatic lead character and a fairly engaging storyline ideal for those who enjoy light gothic themes and genre blends but it might disappoint those seeking deeper exploration of the addams family or a more adult tone
1,its waste of money suddenly switch of the laptop but wont start again customer service not responding at all taking longer time to respond
1,laptop is good but delivery service is bad the product is not deliver in time
1,as this was my first experience with watching one of tim burtons products i had no expectations about it whatsoever and after watching it i cant say that i am really impressed i believe if you are into spooky things this can be an enjoyable watch but given that i dont consider myself as a big fan of this genre the series didnt make too big of an impression on me i also believe that the main target audience for this series are early teenagers as the setting of the series is very stereotypically that of an teenage series another thing i would like to point out that bothered me was that the plot twist was very obvious as you could very early figure out who is the odd person that could be behind all of this and the last thing is that the way some situations played out was very unbelievable as the possibilities of them turning out like that should have been ridiculously low but if all of these things dont bother you i believe this series would be a very interesting and fun watch for you
1,this is not fast and smooth laptop
1,very substandard product it gets hanged up repeatedly and my son who was supposed to have used it for his online classes has not been able to use it for a single class humble advise not to buy this product
1,so very disappointed the cake sunk in the middle and had a crusty looking lighter color brown in the middle i usually use a hand mixer on a low setting but this recipe said combine therefore i used a whisk until all was combined i needed this for our easter dinner now i need to go to the supermarket to buy a cake i will cut it in pieces later to see if it tastes any good i cant serve it as is i am not too sure if i should even bother making the icing this turned out to be an expensive cake re the guinness beer that no one will drink

1,i was very shocked to receive this dress with a rusty zipper looks like crusty white rust see attached pictures the dress fabric is very nice and i did try it on and it is a very nice fit lined with a little stretch but my gosh what a cheap poor quality zipper that looks like it was old and exposed to moisture because the metal parts have a white crusty substance retailer you really need to check your merchandise before sending to your loyal customers lately the quality has been declining a
1,agree with other poster this shirt runs very big im all for a flowy shirt that hides my belly but this is just a tent ill be retuning it
1,this is so thin and poor quality especially for the price it felt like a thin pajama top the buttons are terrible little shell buttons this could not have been returned faster
1,wrost experience i am using since last months it is lagging in small tasks and work on the ms excel please dont buy
1,even following the care label exactly it shrunk inches in the length and overall in the diameter i had to return this since i am tall and it looked more like a workinappropriate mini after the first wash
1,i am so sad i have to return these leggings theyre adorableso much so that my fiancã commented favorably on thembut as other reviewers have pointed out theres no elastic or string in the waistband so you have to walk around holding them up with one hand or theyll fall down why sleeping on snow whyyyyyyyyyyy theyre so great otherwise
1,i dont understand why imdb doesnt differentiate the season but the third season of white lotus reduce my original rating to stories is very slow that i literally falls asleep the last twenty minutes of the last episodes lots of unnecessary fillers this rd season should just be done in episodes if there are a better editing and no fillers very annoying part of the story seems forced like how this guy be rich when the only ebackground story we got was his dad was killed also the castings are not that good this time mother who forced the way she talks to make mark in the movie daughter who almost doesnt have presence guys who dont look rich looks like they were just picked up from the street of bangkok the guy who tried to avenge looks like he is always sweaty and uncomfortable stories are rather predictable at this point i can bet who did the shooting despite writer trying to make it a bit complicated which is totally not
1,im sorry but what a disaster this has become all the show runners had to do was a faithful adaptation of the books but they decided to diverge from them look at got they faithfully adapted the books and the show was great it only went sideways when they ran out of books the last of us faithfully adapted a game and it was very well received hissrich only needed to adapt the books and with henry they had a guaranteed hit but she went and cocked it all up netflix should finally wake up and listen to the people that love the source materials and all would be good instead they make up fan fictions jam diversity down our throats and this is the result
1,display is not good and battery backup is bad
1,worst product worst customer care service dont buy it
1,i used only year month laptop mother board damaged now not working
1,this is a very awkward and unflattering shirt i am very petite pounds and the arms fitlength and width but nothing else about this fit the scoop was so low and wide that i would require a shirt underneath it fell exactly like a tent and made a bell shape around my thighs yikes it looks cute on the model but not on me the material is also very thin and felt sort of like it should be a pajama top
1,these reboots usually suck see tales of the city but to my surprise and delight netflixs new addams family spinoff wednesday works a charm it works best when its simply being funny the heavy plotting around a mysterious supernatural something or other very very mid but you need something to propel the story forward enough to stretch it out for eight episodes ms ortega is a charismatic performer playing a character who is decidedly anticharisma so thats an accomplishment she has a face that triumphs over deadpan the addams family was always about a love of the macabre and a fascination with the darker aspects of human nature all the while being true to your weird self and wednesday never loses sight of that even when taking its characters into new territory
1,i thought this was okay not terrible but certainly worth all the rave reviews it feels like people have just jumped on a bandwagon literally nothing of note happens for four episodes you couldnt get away with things like that in the old days of people watching week by week everyone would have switched off jennifer coolidge is good as tanya but the character gets more and more annoying as the episodes play out i stuck with series two just because i thought there must be a huge denouement there wasnt the guy from essex was also really poorly written i really dont get all of the hype
1,this is absolutely the worst key lime pie i have ever tasted maybe its because i am a native floridian but this is terrible no one in my family would eat it and i had to throw it away i made it on a trip to st louis because i couldnt get key lime juice but it was a waste of time and money disgusting by the way key lime pie is never green if its green its not the real thing
1,came out like soup with tbs of liquid the apples didnt get soft
1,worked fine for a month and then after about a month the phone didnt see the card any more tried to read it on several pcs and none of them detected the card unfortunately it hadnt been backed up so all pictures and videos take on the phone are now gone
1,i was very disappointed with this recipe i agree with tilda it was dry and had no flavor i was expecting an orangey tasting cake and could taste no orange i made this for my grandson age and he did not care for it at all he loves everything i make for him and is so easy to please but this did not please had to throw it away
1,the volume is so low even on the loudest setting even if you hold it to your ear you cant listen the breathing heartbeat sounds it was a gift to someone and unfortunately i cant return it now waste of money its used just as a soft toy now could have just bought a soft toy and would have cost much less
1,this dress is not flattering the slip is very small and short and the dress is big and billowy like the other reviewer said its more like a tablecloth that you stick your head through it was really hard to figure out how to cinch in the waist but it didnt help regardless the length is not accurate either i would say its a pretty short dress mid thigh but that probably depends on the person it also makes you look very horizontal i was really excited about this dress but its getting r
1,i have not had many problems with what i have bought over the years but when i do i will make sure to warn others i loaded a handful of videos from my pc and then installed this in my android tablet for a trip corrupted nothing worked and sometimes it can be seen other times it doesnt even show up the tablet wants to format it which it has never been able to do successfully and needless to say it is too small to even be a paperweight the sd adapter that it came with was also junk and upon the first time i went to use it it simply didnt feel right so i used my trusty lexar micro sd to usb that came with my lexar gb micro sd cardi would have expected more and unfortunately as it stands many people have success with them working and equally those that do not i have even formatted it to see if it made any difference and there was none and of course my window of return is gone so unless the seller stands behind it it is going in the trash i knew i should have gone with what i had purchased before as i have three of them working perfectly for over a year moreover what is even a bigger disappointment is that our camera that uses a standard sd card and it is a noname with no identifying marks has worked for two years without a problemi do know problems arise but when the cost of a product goes up and up and the quality control goes down i am not going to be the one accepting those terms if youre looking for a good card search amazon for this one lsdmigbsbnar this is the lexar and i have thousands of pictures video clips and it has even endured three updates to my phone plus i carry my phone everyday so it is subject to everyday life all the time it has been tough stuff
1,do not buy lenovo product dont ever try to buy this producti am suffering from a screen problem totally white and this issue began just after days of warranty
1,the fabric of this looks and feels so cheap its hard to believe this is anna sui i would say this is unwearable there is zero stretch and it is made of itchy textured poly fabric that looks like novelty fabric at best going back asap
1,the photos dont look it but the one i received was a cropped length the bottom of the sweaters longest parts didnt even reach the top of my midrise pants and im so it wasnt that the model is a lot shorter than me unless their models are tall disappointed since i wasted my retailer discount on this
1,the small zipped and laid flat measures across at the bottom of the armholes at the waist and from shoulder seam to bottom edge its too small for a size and not by just a little too bad because it really is very pretty
1,not satisfying after buy this
1,i bought the medium to dark one hopingthat it would do something i have fair skin btw followed the instructions applied waited overnight and some more waiting nothing apart from the typical smell which i dont appreciate waste of money
1,im disappointed in these pants which looked so beautiful online and even have pockets in person the pattern and colors arent as nice the fabric is too thin and the pants look cheap the pockets are pretty shallow the fit isnt good either i ordered up im between sizes and theyre still not as flowy as id have liked these are too pricy as lounge pants for me to be on the fence about them so theyre going back if you buy them knowing about the thin fabric and snug fit they might wo
1,the defense of its a satire and everyone hating doesnt understand there are plenty of good ones this aint one of them stellar cast thats about the only positive i kept hoping after each episode there was something nope i honestly dont understand why anyone read this and thought ill do this apart from shooting in hawaii during a global pandemic
1,very bad system
1,for some unknown reason i could not stop watching this show i suppose i was drawn in by the strange characters and possibility that something big could happen to save the show and by the time i reached the th episode and no real plot had ever formed i figured the ending had to at least be huge and redeeming for the show to receive such a high rating but the ending was extremely underwhelming with a minor plot twist that left me unsatisfied
1,i was really excited when i ordered this dress for na upcoming beach vacation but was very disappointed when i finally saw it in person it reminded me of those christmas nightgowns from the s with the red and white ruffles pass
1,i loved this coat in the picture and couldnt wait to get it sadly it did not deliver in real life i got my usual size small and it fit well in the shoulders and sleeves and okay in front the big problem was the back it just hung from my shoulders with zero shape and a lot of extra fabric i considered trying the xs but was concerned that the shoulders might not be comfortable and honestly i cant believe the xs could possibly have been different enough to work maybe i got a defectiv
1,actually a nice idea the functions are very nice and reassuring our daughter months found him greatnow the big hook comes he does not work any more after a short time always goes off on his own and can then no longer be switched onhe was returned and ordered elsewhere but also the second one there was the same problem also this was returned and we dont want any more battery change supplied batteries are probably only intended for demo purposes in the shop helped nothing at all
1,product is not upto the mark often restarts itself after pressing power button multiple times laptop starts even when battery is charged system restarts only after plugin in laptop keys are also not very good sound is very is low important think is clock speed of the cpu is merely approx ghz
1,as a fan of the games and books i was unbelievably skeptical when i heard netflix would be doing an adaptation of the witcher i am also not a huge fan of henry cavills acting style but i decided to give it a shot right off the bat the atmosphere is spot on i felt like i was readingplaying the witcher the casting is so well done and i still cant get over how wonderful most of the creaturesmonsters look whether you are familiar with the source material or not i cannot recommend this show enough i have watched it through twice and am planning another watch soon although there are certain things i think could have been executed better theyre not even really worth mentioning if you like interesting characters and a good story do yourself a favour and watch this
1,this dress is just very unattractive it is quite shortwaisted almost empire and so the pockets hit in an odd place also it is very long midi length and the skirt is very wide the effect is matronly not cute at all sizewise it fit true to size and it is a nice medium weight denim and the construction is good
1,i am fully unhappy with this product waste of money dont buy any one
1,review after month use very bad laptop it keep getting stuck again and again waste of money dont buy it
1,as a long term lee child and reacher fan its great to finally see a fitting tribute both in character and the storyline especially after the disappointment of the previous hollywood releases hopefully more seasons to come please prime
1,i have quite a few pairs of retailer pants and jeans my favorites are the cords i got last year similar to these so when i saw this fun pair i had to have them i ordered both the and the to try on they are even more beautiful in person than online and they are so so small it wasnt like they were a tad snugi couldnt even get the button across to meet the buttonhole on the ive never had a problem fitting into retailer pants before this was an extradepressing first time
1,i loved these pants the minute i put them on and was so happy id ordered them but i wore them only times and only at dinners with friends not even for full days and the seams on both legs ripped open i think the faux leather just isnt equipped to handle the stretch of fitted leggings i was superbummed about this because these pants are so insanely cute but if they cant hold up to a few casual wears then theres just no way thankfully retailer was true to their brilliant custom
1,i thought this was more like an oversized sweatshirt not at all im either a m or l and i bought a large and that was too small and too tight it is more fitted if you are looking for something more comfy dont buy however if you want more of a fitted blouse feel then go for it
1,ive had the card for over a month using it in my samsung galaxy note i filled the card with a few tv shows and movies to watch on the go as well as many pdfs and ms word docsthe ms word and pdf files often get corrupted after use the larger files seem to stay intact i moved the smaller files into the internal storage and havent had problem sinceim hoping sandisk has a decent return policy

1,this dress comes with a built in fupa literally there is extra material at the lower abdomen that sticks out and is very unflattering
1,i wanted to like the white lotus but was disappointed to find that the characters were stereotypical and not nuanced and the story revolved around sex and drugs a great way to fill up an hour without any realistic personal dynamics the rich people were generally neurotic narcissistic and selfish and the resort staff were not that much better with one shining exception now i have friends who really liked it but for me the show was pretty boring and predictable i actually could only bear the first two seasons and that was it couldnt bear the thought of spending my time watching the third
1,after only months the mechanism that mimics the breath has brokensin was a good product but given the duration and the price i do not recommend it
1,this looked fabulous on the model of course and i love sweater dresses but even in an xs i was drowning in fabric and looked ludicrous concept is good but execution went terribly wrong somewhere a definite return
1,im baffled why none of the other reviewers have mentioned how large these pants are i ordered the petite small and im always a small these are huge i felt like i had on a large i like the thin material and color and im sad that they are so large
1,got this product and it was fine until it just stopped workingthe last one i had that came with my droid x on release day worked for the whole time since i got it without a hitchi get this one and its dead in less than daysi dont know if i got a lemon myself or the whole supply is bad or faulty all i have to say is i am very displeased

1,i have exclusively used sandisk extreme cards in my pro photography gear for years and they have never let me down this one is a dud though i plugged it in let my phone format it and then start copying to it everything copied just fine but after i got done thats when it started acting upif i had my phone plugged into the computer and was using it as a storage device i got tons of crc errors andor messages saying that i needed to format the card before using it the phone would come up from time to time saying that i had inserted a blank card if i reboot the phone it works fine for a little bit and the errors would start again i thought maybe it was the way the phone formatted so i tried to format it on the computer but that didnt help anythingvery frustrating thankfully ive had it for days before the trouble started so its going back to amazon for a refund and ill have to find a more reliable card for my phone
1,the dress ran big but is tight at the bust material is sooo sheer and the shape of the dress is off you cant see the ruffle flounce that runs the bottom of the dress
1,very bad laptop and the performance and battery was not good
1,brilliant really powerful great characters compelling stories excellent for a binge watch acting is first class cinematography is amazing and creates a dark mood to go with the dark stories whether its totally authentic to the period or not is a mute point as its a fiction it feels like it could be and thats what counts some of the violence is a bit shocking but adds to the grittiness of the show im about to watch series six and cant wait cant agree with or understand people rating this poorly perhaps its cool to be be controversial the music and occasional slowmo add to the tension rather than detracting from it watch it and judge for yourself certainly look at how many ratings not the occasional
1,laptop is very overheating and charging point connect disconnect auto dont work proper cheap quality laptop dont buy i am not satisfy buy this laptop because my laptop battery not work properly and overheating very overheating

1,i was so excited to get this robe in the mail but was beyond disappointed when i opened the package the fabric is extremely stiff and thin the fabric felt like something curtains would be made out of and the white background was see through the robe is very short and cut small in the shoulders therefore it looked like i was wearing a piece of childrens clothing i also ordered the matching pj pants but didnt even take them out of the package after seeing how rough and see through the mater
1,childsize not sure where this went wrong but its going back immediately always wear a in retailerpologist skirts this size runs at least two sizes too small the material is beautiful but if i got the size i needed i would be entirely swallowed by fabric so disappointing
1,it is a shame when a product such as this is left on the website after so many comments reveal the item to be more defective in production than an opinion of size proportion i read the reviews so had expected the item to run small so i ordered accordinglythis does not run smallthis is not representative of any of the three categories one associates with womens apparel sizing i am usually a small and the description by previous reviewers described the fit as being perfect for mevery small
1,recently received this and was very disappointed with the quality the fabric was very thin easily stretched out of shape price is ridiculous for this item
1,i should have paid closer attention to the other reviews i could barely get this blouse over my head after getting it on the armholes too are very small the blouse other than that is pretty and very girlie i love the pleating and dolman sleeves but i was strangled around my neck i tried the small but think a medium wouldnt have been much better it needs a button opening on neck and sleeves i would have to put this on before makeup or doing my hair if you have a tiny head and pencil a

1,while i like the product the bottle is unsuitable the plastic is very thin which is a good thing and this means it almost impossible to pick up the bottle and fill the very small cap without spilling a significant amount especially when the bottle is still relatively full do buy this but only if you are happy to decant the content into a sturdier bottle
1,the material is cheap and looks torn not as nice as the picture
1,poor display
1,worst laptop ever too much heating issues after a lot of heating issue laptop shut down immediately
1,i bought this product a week back but guess what the display started slightly shaking but now its not opening as i showed in this photo its started like that when i watching movie i thought this was quite a good brand since i was using their mobile from past years but my laptop experience was worst being a student its very hard for us to get issue with this budget laptops im really disappointed within
1,it is not a ips display not a quality werest product charge is also not compatible
1,the fit on this is so strange the middle string is definitely too long and the thin halter top offers hardly any lift the print is lovely and the quality nice for the price the cups are padded which is nice i suppose but would barely cover anything bigger than a c cup im guessing im a dd size in pants and size in dresses and i ordered a medium i also have a long torso which probably didnt help
1,after a small preasure while trying to remove it from a device it got brokenalso the io speed is not amazing even for a class
1,i just dont get what has happened to sandisk quality it seems to have gone down over the years this product was glitchy from day one i thought it would be fine after a quick check disk but then it only got worse after less than a week i have to return it what upsets me is that this is not my first bad experience with sandisk products i used to buy them all the time they were my brand of choice for flash memory cards or thumb drives the last three products i have bought from them have had problems and failed either immediately or shortly after usage so i give up i will start looking to other companies for my memory needs i bought a transcend to replace this i hope it works out better
1,after a few weeks unfortunately no longer functioning music function

1,bad product with bad service of dont buy go with brand
1,andor has cemented itself as one of if not the best star wars content we have got so far all round consistent and very mature while it can be slow paced at multiple times this adds a whole new level to the story and the development of the characters the achievement in directing cinematography and writing are only some of the highlights in addition to this the dialogue is probably the best out of any star wars content unforgettable moments like luthens or mon mothmas speech are obviously some of the moments that have stuck with me and have become undeniable highlights of this beloved franchise the development of so many new characters keeps the series fresh while also adding value to the story of rogue one beside amazing arcs of personas such as andor mothma and saw the newly created characters of syril karn and dedra meero have offered us perhaps the best writing of any character in the franchise overall the show keeps a way above average consistency with the highest peak being reached during the final arcs of the last season
1,these jeans were so cute on wore them a handful of times and theyd been washed twice put them on and rip ripped right at the crotch in the front so not fixable and on vacation no less when i had to scramble to find something else to wear poor quality disappointing and not what i expected from retailer they also run large even for a more relaxed fit sized down for a good fit

1,made this pie for thanksgiving dinner i should have read the reviews i have made many pies this was the absolute worst i have ever produced i used my normal crust recipe with this one for the filling like the others my crust looked beautiful but when we cut into the pie it was a mess of undercooked apples with a ton of runny juice it never set up this recipe needs to be removed it definitely does not work the way its published you guys should be ashamed of it readers should not have to tweak your recipe in order to make it work remove please

1,this dress looks lovely on the model but it looks just awful on me i am and curvy the shoulders are cut w a weird shape instead of a cap sleeve it is like a pointy cap on the side and stuck out on my shoulders it looks like i am ready to get beamed into space the material is nice and the sequins are pretty but the cut of the dress is unflattering
1,this doesnt work on the galaxy note it is getting detected however it is not being utilized by the note
1,this recipe claims the prep is mins it has been over hour and mins and i have only managed to chop my potatoes make the gravy which wasnt enough to cover my meat so ill be making another batch and cook pork chop will never make again i only made pork chops because i was so hunrgry and felt like passing out didnt have the energy to make the other chops it took hour and mins to bake on for an hour then for mins the flavor was delicious og the gravy i added some garlic in it an my potatoes were perfect but my chops were dry tasting my grandma used to bake her chops with potatoes and i was craving it but this is definently not my grandmas way of making it her chops were very juicy and delicious and the gravy was more liquid like but she is passed so the recipe is still a mystery but this helped curbed that craving i do suggest not adding salt to this dish because the chicken broth already has alot of salt in it

1,this sweater is a lovely color and very soft however the sweater sheds terribly and the color is very large distracting from the overall appearance its also thin and whatever shirt is worn underneath will show through
1,wednesday is a series my wife and i finished this morning the storyline follows wednesday addams being sent to the same super natural school her parents attended a serial killer emerges in the woods around the school that fascinates wednesday wednesday will need to balance a dirty word for her called friends while trying to discover whom the serial killer is and discovering a mystery of her parents past this series is directed by tim burton beetlejuice james marshall into the badlands and gandja monteiro the chi the cast includes jenna ortega scream gwendoline christie game of thrones riki lindhome the last house on the left christina ricci the addams family catherine zetajones chicago and luis guzmán traffic the atmosphere for this picture was absolutely amazing i was thoroughly impressed by jenna ortega as wednesday she was amazing her mannerisms and facial expressions were perfect the settings were brilliant and have an obvious tim burton feel to them adding wednesday to a school filled with other unique children gave the film a harry potter feel to it i thoroughly enjoyed the diverse group of characters the cgi used for the monsters and magic were perfect the storyline was very clever in how it weaves in the past and present keeps you guessing and tells you a little more about the addams family than you knew going in the last minutes did feel a little rushed but i still enjoyed it overall this was better than i ever imagined going in this is a series that needs a season asap and is an absolute must see i would score this a and strongly recommend it
1,it doesnt have many prots to connect the ubs drives
1,i do not recommend this laptop only se days the laptop is hanging and too slow only show razen but work as a less than i service centre is not help according customer
1,dont buy and waste money
1,directors completely overstretched use of slowmo and distorted guitars this is like a neverending videoclip of a nick cave track and after season it just goes on your nerves season is unwatchable shame because the acting costumes sets and dialogues are great take out the slow mo walking and the guitars fill the space with action background or character development and you have a great show instead of a video clip
1,the worst meatloaf ive ever tasted i followed recipe to the tyak
1,no bland and dry yes i followed the recipe into the garbage after so much prep yes im irritated
1,tags sewn in small about long and huge about x very itchy so i cut them out then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags not comfortable at all also i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work i am a b cup however this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup so for me this would only be a lounging bralette if it wasnt so itchy

1,we did not like this at all the chili powder was too overwhelming and i think taco seasoning would be a much better choice
1,i really did heres why i just couldnt the lace strips make it look cheap the fabric is soft but the pattern is undistinguished the fit is very disappointingmedium looked square and boxy the large was massive and in both sizes the vneck was too low to wear without a camisole underneathwhich defeated the purpose
1,i ordered this tee despite the price the fabric is very thin and the quality was poor nice concept for a tee but failed in quality and value it was returned
1,had to return this item it would not fit properly into the adapter that it came with return was no problem but i am reluctant to buy another one
1,sure alan ritchson looks like the impressive intense lowkey drifter from the books but the scripts here only partially grasp his overwhelming intellectual sharpness it is easier in the book to describe at length what goes on in his mind and it was the actual challenge reacher said nothing needs a lot of script powerlifting to translate to the screen better than what we have seen umpteen times with lone action men bordering on superheroes and yes ritchson is good again but he looks too much like a clean waxed bodybuilder there is no much grit apparent in his stature surprising that lee child somewhat let it slip and did not request to make the real reacher more of the brawler he is at heart season was good although here y after i read killing floor i was not overly impressed by the scenes that got me hooked to reacher from the very first book season puts back reacher with the special investigators so he sadly looks smaller in the cast more of a social outcast a meek beast rather than the inspiring leader narrowminded passive rather than extremely thoughtful also i had formed luminous images from the action in california bad luck and trouble yet they decided nynj was good enough for their production values bottom line the series does not stand out it feels content with the opportunity to cash in on a franchise its a pass for me now
1,display quality is not good it is yellowish dont buy it and was having power button issue too that sometime when power is pressed the laptop wont start
1,speakers are very bad very poor quality

1,i was so disappointed with this recipe it tasted like sugar and vinegar i double checked and measured correctly it was not edible
1,when george lucas created the original star wars he wanted to make a space western many of the stylistic choices that have since become iconic of the franchise costumes sound effects character design cinematography were made due to budget constraints what we know as star wars now evolved from a simplistic concept something i loved about the original star wars was the characters situations landscapes and special effects that came from those constraints and the world building that always seemed to just scratch the surface of worlds and characters that were introduced one of the primary problems i have with the prequel trilogy and especially the new trilogy is that the creators seemed only to have the desire to expand the universe rather than give it the depth and grit it deserved the mandalorian fixes all of that jon favreau who despite probably having heaps of money thrown at his budget for this show keeps it remarkably restrained in special effects and simple storyline he shows genuine respect for the characters and world he is working in and in turn shows respect for the audience the show is targeting in the two episodes i have watched i have gotten everything i wanted from the show the linear and engaging storytelling the wild west atmosphere the characters you can care about the grit and grime of the underworld of the star wars universe its everything i wanted it to be ive even gotten some high budget firefly vibes from what is an increasingly indepth space western if star wars were xmen then the mandalorian is logan it is legitimately that good
1,i got this for my samsung galaxy tab p and it worked great for about weeks september through today october it just died while i had the tablet attached to my pc and was copying another file onto it so ive changed my rating from stars to just star id give stars if i could another user warned me that this had happened to him after months but weeks ive reported this to amazon and asked for a refundstay as far away from this card as you can at least for the galaxy tab update amazon refunded my money for this card and i replaced it with the samsung equivalent which is still working perfectly dont waste your time and money on this card get the samsung
1,the best thing about season is no more jennifer coolidge she plays a version of the same character in every role she takes she seems to be the type of actress that people either love or hate i find a little goes a long way she doesnt steal scenes so much as she elbows the other actors out of the way to be the center of attention season was an improvement i enjoyed the sicilian setting gorgeous views and a gorgeous cast the story was more varied and the characterizations were superbly done season is as some reviewers remarked a long uneventful slog that seems to go nowhere with episodes left im hoping mike white picks up some steam and delivers a satisfying ending hes certainly capable of it at least i dont have to put up with coolidge chewing up the scenery yet again
1,if i could sew id take the fabric from this skirt and make it into a different shape after ordering a bigger size the fabric is just as it appears online totally gorgeous with almost a quilted feel to it however this thickness means the skirt sticks out like something judy jetson would wear its also too small in my goto skirt size and i order a lot at retailer the waist and hips are small making the skirt too short as well but the bottom flares out ridiculously i ordered two of
1,whats the big deal aside from it having alexandra daddario and sydney sweeney not worth it
1,the writing is so painful i cannot watch further episodes they jumped the shark minutes into the son who portrays the former navy seal is laughable in his decision making navy seals are professional there are zero likable characters in reality big farm ranch operators are some of the most stable minded and rational individuals one could ever find i really wanted this to be good i love kevin costner as a cowboy this show is a joke

1,why was there so much music this season were the first two seasons like that i dont think so i found it really distracting and aggravating to the point where i muted the show and just read the subtitles it almost seemed like the music was being used to evoke the emotions and tone that the actors and directors were responsible for other shows use music much more effectively and with less of a heavy hand i hope the next season does not rely so heavily on music if so i will be turning it off as soon as i hear the first set of bongos or wind chimes kick in i loved the first two seasons but this one was almost unbearable to finish
1,i went with my usual size but it is too tight it fits but i would feel uncomfortable in it i ordered the pink one which looks nice in the picture but in person it looks cheap the beading at the neckline immediately looked to me like cocktail dresses my grandma used to wear in the s that beaded neckline added to the cheap look this one is not for me

1,i was so excited to splurge on a mara hoffman suit and was sorely disappointed when i received this suit in the mail im petite and fairly curvy so i knew it would likely be a little long in the torso but the whole suit was so oddly shaped i couldnt imagine anyone it would fit the square shape in between the halter pieces is awkward and the pieces that are supposed to hold your chest are super wide and loose
1,product is bad battery backup is low only minites

1,this jacket is so cute and fits perfect and i love the motif however it deposited black linty particle all over my pants and top and the fabric was already pilling just from being on the hanger in the store this piece will look badwornold in a very short period of time its a big shame because its so perfect in every other way i choose not to buy it its very expensive for the quality
1,i was impressed by everything in seasons and everything was just perfect then from bad to worse to unwatchable i am not gonna watch more and i will keep checking the episodes ratings to figure out if they managed to save this if not i dont care about whats next any more it is getting corny and pretentious to the extent that i started to dislike elisabeth moss herself three seasons were enough i have no clue what you are really doing with the storyline nothing looks promising so thank you for the first two seasons but i am not okay with the rest elisabeth moss should find another show to do
1,i have always bought interesting pretty wearable dresses for my daughters at retailer now the dresses are just retro funky sad to see

1,this critic text is only about season andrzej sapkowski wrote in a lesser evil giving birth to geralt of rivia he then wrote a series of short stories about him making some twists about fairy tales or folklore creatures and setting them in his dark fantasy universe then he wrote his epic pentalogy of the rescue of ciri saga following some of the plot developed in his previous short stories i didnt expect the series to be good but boy i was wrong after all the buzz about the political casting of a multicultural cast and the precedents of netflix doing some horrendous work in some adaptations i was very cautious about this series and im still not ok with some of the casting selection like merigold triss among others but generally the cast is astounding and they did the most important thing right the characterization of geralt of rivia this is a character ridden story and the character of geralt is one hell of a characterization i liked the leaked photos of henry cavil but more than physically he is the character made life and this was a blessing yennefer and ciri are pretty good well see in the future and some of the secondaries like cahir and renfri are really well done the tone the setting the strange chronically order and the language is like i imagined it more or less because im not a native english reader and the material was well adapted in spanish to fit the redneck language in some characters among other things but the way they adapted the short stories the witcher the lesser evil a question of price and others is astounding and perfectly executed i would really like to see adapted all the short stories like the doppelganger one among others but i understand the need to adapt this material as a prequel to the ciri saga and i also understand the necessary adaptations to the series format which has been done pretty well the effects the makeup the costumes are really well done well maybe not the nilfgaard armor i hope the viewers enjoy this saga as i did and they are not anoyed with the weird timeline it is the only thing that i can see as a impediment to truly enjoy it i devoured the series as i did with the books and i felt hooked again on them i can only hope that the adaptation follows with this level and that they continue this good work
1,screen quality is very bad dont by this laptop
1,couldnt even get past the first minutes of the show seemingly the addams family is a perfect story for tim burton to remake given both his and the storys penchant for dark whimsical humor whats disappointing about this production is that it lacks both whimsy and humor where there was previously a loving family that couldnt find a place in acceptable society because they went against social norms here we have an unoriginal story about an angsty teen that doesnt like their parents i feel this lacks creativity or innovation to justify the time required to watch all episodes of the show
1,do not buy this product material quality is very cheap and sound is worst
1,very tasty but it has well over of a persons daily requirement of sodium i would avoid eating this except is very small amounts
1,i wanted to love this so badly jenna ortega was amazing as wednesday i could tell she put a lot of work into this character the series as a whole felt more like a gothic nancy drew the story line was very predictable as well as the ending most of the supporting characters gave off disney like qualitiesespecially in the acting thing had more charisma than those with actual speaking roles it seemed like most of the effort was put into building this version of wednesday and the rest the storyline the plot the supporting characters were all thrown in as an afterthought i had no expectations going into this series but wednesdaythe teenage detective was the last thing i imagined
1,i loved this skirt when i tried it on the material is soft with a bit of stretch id say this runs a little large for reference im usually a size in retailer and the was still a little large towards the end of the day as it stretched out however my disappointment was with the buttonsi wore it for a day when all of a sudden the top button popped off fine that button is the most used i sewed it back on myself and even reinforced the top three buttons that i use to take on and of
1,i was really disappointed in the shirt the blue embroidery is a lot darker than what is shown in the photo and barely stands out against the black the photo does not accurately depict this shirt i will be returning
1,april i have had the card for about months and seemed to work fine i use it to store additional files on my ultrabook as the solid state drive is small only gb about a month ago the card could not be recognized it only lasted about hours so i thought maybe just a momentary blip however this weekened it cannot be recognized at all and it has been days sandisk support is not available until the week so i will update on tech support soon however i did find that the sandisk indicated there was a defect with some of these cards i assume they will replace it but i have lost lots of hours and a lot of pictures so i am really bummed and frustratedfrom sandisk sandisk has been made aware of potential product issues involving a very small percentage of its gb and gb sandisk mobile ultra microsd cards under certain circumstances the cards may lock up and the card becomes inaccessible the issue has been identified and a manufacturing fix has already been put in place sandisk stands behind its products and any customer who experiences this issue with the microsd cards cards is asked to contact the sandisk support center for a resolution immediately sandisk

1,horrible fit not true to size again aline outside of the dress and a very tight camisole underneath
1,the handmaids tale was high on my list of series that i wanted to watch unfortunately what was initially intended to be a criticism of a sensitive subject approached in a serious and realistic manner turns into a poorly constructed spy plot i finally gave up at the end of season i loved the first season for its cinematography music and elisabeth mosss masterful performance i thought the writers had succeeded brilliantly in creating a frightening dystopian world where every wrong move has serious consequences if not outright death i particularly liked the scene in which a commander agrees to have his forearm amputated for being guilty of lust the procedure is cold and surgical and shows us that no one can escape gileads laws this sense of omnipresent danger effectively creates an atmosphere of terror and despair akin to that felt when watching the schindlers list theres the scene in spielbergs film where the prisoners find themselves crammed into a large room that they terrified would be a gas chamber but turns out to be a communal shower this scene came to mind at the start of season when the maids are carried to the scaffold then a kate bush song breaks the mood i asked myself why why add an artificial touch of melodrama to an already terrifying situation from that point on all the annoying little things about the series became more obvious to me the overuse of slowmotions the outofplace songs the countless zooms in on junes face and please stop saying its to show us her pov this technique has never been essential for a good actor to show us his inner thoughts for example just think of tom hanks in forrest gump or cast away if the series had ended with season i think it would rank alongside true detective season as one of the best unfortunately the end of the season is more than a little dubious and the third deconstructs all the rules so well established up to that point added to this are numerous plotholes a completely illogical plot armor and a perplexing timeline such as hannah and the babies who never grow old even though everything points to the fact that its taken quite some time to set up this whole system of laws and customs including colonies with cemeteries that are already wellstocked even the commander says in the old days we used to cut off a hand today its just a finger in short when the qualities of the first season gave way to script gymnastics obvious sign of laziness on the part of the writers and the faults and annoying things became too numerous to be ignored i decided to abandon that is to say at the end of season too bad it started off so well
1,i ordered this skirt because it looked cute and versatile when it arrived the pleat in front shown in the center was far to the right so the overall look was crooked not sure if it was a quality control issue or if thats the true design but it will have to go back too bad because i had high hopes

1,i enjoyed every second of this seires and await season with open arms as some reviewers have said this is how you capture the feeling of starwars while creating of a new fresh story literally brought a smile to face all the way through and the season finale no words to explain this seires and possibly rouge one are carrying the starwars franchise on their shoulders this is how its done disney now you just need to sort the main story films out and you are flying its worth paying for disney plus just for this binge watch it in a couple of days then cancel it until for the next season haha
1,first off we all had our doubts and imaginative aspirations on the casting and adaptation creation when tlou series was introduced even with the heavy budgeting and still in the front seat of creation neil druckmann many obstacles arised whom would play the cold and heartless joel miller when pedro was introduced we all knew he was an actor but could he depict and foretell a story so sad and hardening like the one of joel miller pedro is phenomenal and his own taste in what the character means to him shows in his own recreation of joel miller tlou will only get even more immersive and fans of this beautiful series will still continue to be amazed
1,kevin costner and cast are outstanding taylor sheridan creates and directs a masterpiece
1,wanted to love this colorful romper the fabric was suuuuper thin and very cheap feeling and looking no way would i wear this
1,i knew i needed to buy this trench from the moment i saw it on my computer screen but something prompted me to stop by my local retailer and try it on first thank goodness for that at first glance i knew i wouldnt be buying this the construction leaves much to be desired from the flimsy single layer of unlined unstructured fabric to the thin strip of fabric serving as a belt i could easily see this being sold at a cheap store for teenage girls where throwaway clothes are a dim
1,followed the recipe exact refrigerated this overnight and when i cut in to it the next morning to serve with coffee it literally ran the inside never set and it turned out soupy not at all what i had expected and i can tell you that it was a complete waste of ingredients threw it in the garbage and i will not waste the time or ingredients again especially with the cost of pecans

1,it fits super baggy everywhere and looked sloppy on me
1,i binge watched the first season two times in a row it was so fresh and familiar at the same time i am not familiar with the books and didnt watch the movies so it was a completely clean slate for me i liked it a lot easily an or for me a big arnie style guy but smart and witty a lone wolf doing ateam style justice in america a complex counterfeiting conspiracy in a small southern town corrupted police it checked all boxes very entretaining with mistery action comedy clever dialogue and writing so i was ready to continue with season nothing could go wrong right well it did what a letdown nothing was there it was a totally different series visually and in terms of acting dialogue and writing what the hell happened there by the looks and what i read everywhere the problem as usual is that the first season was faithful to the source material whereas the second diverged here we go again smart writers screwing up a great idea how not special mention to the season finale oh boy what an epic trainwreck what a disgraceful writing what stupid villains what rushed mess accompanied by no less than half runtime of the lamest resolutions season is a clear which makes an average of for reacher i am afraid if next season gets better it will be taken into account hoping

1,im sure theres someone out there who will look good in this but it certainly wasnt me admittedly im a less than ideal body type at a curvy tall still for a taller person this shirt runs short for a curvy person this does nothing to accentuate a waist for a short person this pattern is very busy even if the colors are beautiful for a busty person the gathers around the chest make for a very frumpy look and even for a short and thin person this shirt runs too big to get a good fit c
1,yikes there is a whole lot of skirt here i am weigh around lb and usually wear anywhere between a four and six in retailer clothing depending on the designer this skirt balloons out from the waist on the website it seems to flow more naturally from the waist i think that the flowers are cute but the material is cheap looking the skirt is very long hitting way below midcalf there is also tons of material creating a parachute effect definitely returning

1,i ordered the blue in size it ran at least two if not three sizes too small compared to my other retailer blouses it was too small through the body other than the peplum the arms were tight too the waistline and length matched the online photos its widening the material they chose was also scratchy and rough especially around the neckline i returned mine after trying it on and seeing there was no way to make this work the blue color was gorgeous though the patterned lace w

1,performance is very poor audio quality is very poor
1,avg product no sound in speaker heating issue etc
1,im very disappointed about this new version of adams family first of all you see the other components of the family just in few episodes and it would be better not to see them at all all the spirit of original adams series was completely lost they act like a common mundane family backing each other up and being there for each other really creepy if you see high votes about this serie probably it comes from who didnt really see the original series or movies even even wednesday sometimes appears upset when she seems to hurt others with her detached and antisocial behavior but come on everything else looks like the darklike version but not so much of hogwarts the settings are also not as gloomy as one would expect from tim burton i think he has definitely lost his magic touch
1,all features are good but after month its overheating
1,windows not activatedshowing hardware in device changed
1,this top was very cute but super short and i am a short waisted petitie personthe waistline hits above your belly button looks very silly

1,worst product ever too many hanging issue and lagging issue in just days and they dont have any service for it dont buy this waste of money
1,i adore the movies from the s so i was absolutely wishing and hoping this show will bring back the charm comedy and eccentricities of the addams considering burton is directing this one boy was i wrong this hits all the wrong spots to the point where its just not the addams family the whole premise revolved around the clash of this unique family with normal vanilla society so we get mermaids and werewolves what this literally makes wednesday lose what was special about her because shes actually the most ordinary one in the bunch shes just a goth girl with mediocre teenage angst and the rest is every highschool show youve ever seen remember her going to camp that was classic this is what i was expecting what i got was just a teenager going to school scoobydoo mystery with none of the ingredients that made this family magical im not even going to get into the casting of the parents each a disgrace to their former counterparts brilliant and charismatic performance they could have just put a black dress on a tree and call it a day below zero chemistry then you have this horrible relationship between wednesday and literally everyone they used to have such amazing family dynamics it was the perfect contrast to their absolute horridness that we all loved wheres the dark comedy wheres the craziness of this twisted family while presenting it completely normal i gave it stars purely because of production value but content is zero for me bored out of my mind justiceforwednesday
1,had to change mother board within day dont by any person
1,it has some funny element for like the first episodes the rest are meh lots of the main characters are very unlikeable was that the point the only characters im kinda rooting for are the jerks wife the manager and the lady from the spa i forgot their names the only reason i waste hours on this series is to see those unlikeable characters fall on their faces but no of course the rich white privileged people are always winning surprise surprise
1,absolutely incredible start and i cant say when i have seen such a good pilot of a series the characters are extremely good choosen this is excactly what i wanted it to look like hbo is bringing another amazing show to us that will blow everyones minds the actors are giving goosebumps already im played the games and of course loved them as anyone else did but bringing it to life and make sure that its that good is something else also its not about doing justice to those who played the games i need everyone to love this as it is i cant wait for what its coming next amazing job hbo did ones again
1,this review is for the sandisk ultra gb microsdhc class uhs memory card with adapter sdsdqugaffpa that was purchased for me from amazonfrustrating in a word this card was reported by two different android phones as damaged but my windows computer recognized it with no issues if the card had nothing on it or had just been reformatted then the phones recognized it but as soon as data music or pictures were added then the phones reported the card as damaged i had this card returned to amazon after days of sheer frustrationi read another review that suggested the class cards were not ideal for smart phones i was already using a sandisk class gb card in another phone and had never had issues so i purchased a class sandisk gb and it was as smooth as butter both phones recognized the card right away and added data music and pictures seamlessly and quickly the second card purchased was the sandisk microsdhc gb flash memory card black sdsdqmgb retail packagingin summary this card may work just fine for other devices but based on the sheer number of other reviewers here on amazon and elsewhere on the internet that had similar issues with smartphones i cannot recommend this card for a smartphone
1,season literally nothing happens you are sitting right in front of the tv watching quirky rich people doing stuff im literally laughing reading this masterpiece reviews i feel these would be the same people who look at a painting of a blank canvas with a squiggly line drawn in the middle and call it a voyage to the end of the universe you cant call these series good and not be pretending that youre seeing something that isnt there i dont feel like getting into season and its the same drivel of nothingness just sucks that we pay attention to empty productions just because they are pushed in our faces
1,ordered this for a galaxy s lasted a few months and then broke is not accessible on several different pcssays limited lifetime warranty bs you have one month for eco zone not only did i lose pictures but now i am out because of a crappy return policyin the future i will be buying kingston not sandiskupdate amazon customer service made good and refunded my purchase price i still will not be buying any more sandisk memory cards however
1,when i saw the trailer for this i truly thought it would be a hyped up disappointing mess however from the very first episode i was hooked every single dialogue every actor every location every character was a masterpiece i absolutely loved this series and it is the best one netflix has ever made i wished it had never ended and this deserved at least episodes jenna ortega fit the role of wednesday perfectly her emotionless delivery of dialogues had so much power and she expressed feelings without even blinking the fact that i was heavily interested in the story line of a hand ie thing is remarkable i simply cannot wait for season two
1,lacked for an hour not even two weeks properly completed and started getting hang an lack alot i wished i was to know these issues b i couldnt bought it

1,this top is perfect for the first day at clown college if you want to see some clowns cry the sleeves are probably the worst part of this overpriced monstrosity the elastic at the cuffs makes the already comically large sleeves billow and puff out even more buy this if you enjoy walking to the post office to return things

1,i bought this card and it worked ok at first after about three weeks i noticed that some images were not showing up a week later it began to loose everything my note was failing to recognize it inserted into the adapter and my comp could see it but not read all the files multiple formats by either the comp or note did not fix the problem even tried some tools that i used for my dslr still nogothis could just be a batch problem as the card looks legit and was fast in the beginning

1,type c port not available and selling old items by showing new pictures in website
1,wednesday is like an outcast nancy drew with a touch of darkness and a bit of stranger things thrown in wednesday is one of those rare shows that took me by surprise in an extremely good way it wednesday kept me intrigued and glued from the first episode to the last it was hands down the only tv show that ive binged watched this year its that captivating the show while hardly original is refreshing and unique from its point of view a teenage wednesday the cast were well chosen apart from imo luis guzman as gomez addams dont get me wrong luis is a great actor and im a fan but as the suave and charming gomez luis is not jenna ortega did a superb job portraying the protagonist wednesday her acting is sublime the other actors in the show did equally a brilliant job kudos to the director tim burton and that dance yeah the dance you cant miss that part i read jenna choreographed it herself apart from the magnificent acting the sets and directing were first rate tim burton knocked another one out of the park but im sure it was made easy with jenna ortega in the main lead her take on wednesday took the character to a whole new level she made wednesday her own love it verdict dont miss it a must watch
1,i only have two pans how do i adjust the ingredients and will it look bad with tiers
1,ag jeans have been a main stay for me they are the most comfortable and best looking jeans on my body however this pair was too tight and shorter then i liked the fabric and color is beautiful i wear the same size for ag no matter the design but this one ran too small i have to return it i will try the next size up if they still have them
1,sound quality is poor screen brightness is less no keybord backlit however its mentioned in description and most of reviews with screenshots for acacl lenovo ideapad slim model built quality is also poor its start bending if you hold laptop with oneside corner so for me its not good deal submitted return request lets see
1,thought this show was incredible even though the creators said theyve tried to separate this from the movies i saw nothing but similarities it was if this show took up like five years later after addams family values left us despite pubert not being present and the movies were absolutely endearing so i really loved this edition butdid not care for gomez portrayal yes he looked much more like the original cartoon character but charles addams himself was a consultant on the original s series and his notes are what actor john astin performed and mimicked by raul julia superbly in the movies the portrayal here was so well wimpy and subdued the crazed dueling latin lover millionaire playboy that others have portrayed is exactly how addams described him to the original shows creators so why this wasnt continued is beyond me
1,sound quality is bad
1,dont go for this product everything is very low quality also the service for this product is very poor from their sides they are aggring this product sound is very low as compared to other brands but still refuse to take actions on this worst product ever used
1,losing pictures video and tunes after months on a samsung galaxy note stock android looks like this is a common problem i will try my luck with sandisk on monday if i dont get a replacement i will never buy a sandisk product again i paid the premium for sandisk quality i am very disappointedupdatesandisk will be providing a replacement sd card however my data loss and downtime cannot be replaced sandisk lost their premium rating in my eyes its going to take a while for them to get it back
1,got this for my samsung after months was no longer accessible first message i got on the phone was that there was an unformatted sd card installed next it wouldnt even recognize the card was in there i inserted a different card and the phone was able to recognize it and play music off it so not the phone i also tried having my desktop read the card no go there either

1,i am generally not a fan of westerns however yellowstone has me hooked its so hard to wait a year for the next season to come around
1,too salty i even omitted the pre salting lacked substancewaste of my good zucchini
1,i thought this dress would be a cute beach cover up so i was excited to order it but i was very disappointed i am and i usually wear a size small top and dress so i ordered a small in this dress but it was huge i understand that it is not meant to be form fitting and i wasnt expecting it to be but when i tried this on i felt like i was wearing a potato sack i feel like an extra small would have been just as bad i was so upset it also has thin silver lines through it which for me m
1,its sheer the design print is casual but on silk like material had it been made out of cotton would have definitely kept it who is going to wear this in the blazing heat of summer
1,looked good in pictures i even ordered an xxs petite and it was huge although the sweater has interesting textures and is very beautiful it is very awkward and poor fit will be sending back
1,flipkart displayed false specifications plastic body display also not good sound quality is worst
1,in my opinion this show watches more like a nancy drew novel meets l than it does the addams family ever since harry potter everyone seems to be trying to capitalize on the mysterious boarding school theme its become a bit tired to say the least even christina ricci played a character type that has been done over and over again in these themes it was definitely not what i was expecting and i dont get all the hype was it mildly entertaining surei guess though i most likely wont be watching it a second time around im guessing it might appeal to a much younger crowd though
1,i read all the reviews about the fabric being see through but liked the dress enough to give it a shot it is soooo see through this trally could only be worn on a beach very disappointed
1,i have bought it on flipkart and its shut down automatically after days
1,extremely plain and flavorless i have a favorite yellow cake recipe but always like to try new things just in case something better might come along this was disappointing to say the least i even added extra vanilla and a touch of cinnamon because the batter tasted like a boxed pancake mix and i always spice up my pancakes if you like plain bland cake then this is for you
1,im not sure why this dress is getting great reviews the plunging neckline is ridiculous and ran down to the underwire of my bra and the slit up the side came up to the upper part of my thigh it was one of the worst fittingcut dresses ive every tried on at retailer im maybe you have to be feet tall and pounds for this dress to not look like a bad renaissance faire costume
1,if you love the books youll love this production unlike the tiny reacher played by cruise the richson incarnation has the physical size and bearing of the book jack reacher the scripted detail in the dialog matches the books glorious detail of reachers deductive superpower as written by lee child in the books and the action scenes are choreographed as well as any block buster action flick kudos to richson for taking his already jacked body up a couple of notches to put on a massive amount of lean muscleno easy task prime would be crazy not to renew this show for at least more of the books
1,mouse not working dont take anyone
1,sound is very low
1,this recipe was poorly written it does not state what temperature the oven should be at or that the whites need to be beaten until stiff white peaks form that information can only be found in the video which does not seem to be as easily accessible
1,i loved the look of this dress online so i was excited to order it but when it arrived i found it was not at all how i expected it to be i thought the material would be more lacy but it seemed pretty cheap there was also some boning at the waist which is nice in theory but it made the material poof out just under the waist making me look like i had a belly no matter what i did i could not get it to lay flat returned to the store and bought the embroidered perennial dress instead which
1,hang iss
1,unfortunately after x use defectivevery nice otter but unfortunately we caught a mondayotter which after a short time does not work properlya lot of money for it a pity
1,no this is one of the most unflattering things ive ever put on my body im a very wellproportioned hourglass i tend to wear a small despite a booty and d chest this made me look huge dont do it
1,do not buy this laptop my laptop started showing blue screen error within months of purchase lenovo has refused to replace or repair the device even though it is under warranty lenovo customer service is pathetic
1,this is literally the most unflattering thing i have ever tried on from retailer the sleeves are so weird and ugly they get really fat at the top like a dolman sleeve but it looks really strange because they dont flow into the rest of the top which is very structured it made my shoulders look huge even though i have very narrow shoulders this is not apparent in the model picture at all the thick black seams at the shoulders are also placed in a really awkward spot which also contri
1,just finished the last episode and i am still amazed by how good it was i just love this take on star wars rogue one was my favourite movie since old trilogy and now we have this epic series great actors great acting great story great scenario great scenes great fx great music i can go like this for long d i am so happy after watching the series and season is for me most anticipated thing in streaming servicescinemas after it goes hotd which is great but it never made me feel so thrilled like this one andor really stands out from other productions especially in star wars universe and i hope it gets the attention and respect it deserves i am sure this will be a series i will be coming back to as i do with sw trilogies
1,in a sea of dresses this is the one that caught my eye in the whole store i am a pear shape and ended up trying both the medium and the large taking the medium home it was super flattering on and was an appropriate length to pair with tights heres where the problem happened i wanted to wear this dress for thanksgiving i put it on and as i tightened the drawstring to cinch in the waist riiiiiiiiiip the drawstring ripped through the fabric at the waistband so disappointed
1,i recently purchased this blouse on their off sale in white i was hoping for a crisp white structured blouse i did read all the reviews and thought i would give it a try anyway it is awful there is no structure or shape but the quality is the reason i am returning it feels like a napkin or thinner not even worth the extra sale price i will be returning
1,one of my favourite show the story the acting and the cinematography are excellent
1,i loved these pants they fit perfectly and then i washed them like the other reviewers the pants came out with spots all over them the color seems to have faded in splotchy patterns so sad wondering if retailer will provide store credit or something to make it right
1,i initially saw this top a few months ago and fell in love it ended up selling out in stores so i ordered it online where it was backordered by a couple of months i received it this past week and was sadly disappointed the design is pretty but overall the quality is sorely lacking i wonder if maybe the first batch was good but when they realized they were so popular and had more made the newer batches werent as good not sure the one i got had inconsistent red embroidery and ther
1,not good very bad quality
1,heating issue current leakage current can be felt all over the laptop during charging
1,i ordered this top on line i wanted to love it but unfortunately the fit was not for me i am with a long torso this top was cut very wide and looks like a maternity top
1,dont work anymore im disgusted we hear more the sound of the engine than the heartbeat
1,camera is very bad its not clear battery backup is very bad sometimes battery can drain out in hour in normal office work screen is ok performance is ok
1,my kids liked this but my wife and i thought it was gross too rich and creamy for my liking it was also too pastey i tend to like my mac and cheese a little milkier than this and not nearly as thick sorry but i wont be making it again
1,i would really like this dress if the material were a little thicker its really thin so you can see my nipples straight through the dress you cant wear a bra with it because it is backless so i dont understand how you are supposed to wear this outside of the house
1,i got this shirt in a medium my normal retailer size and while the short fit the front is cropped i am a fan of the tops that are shorter in the front and longer in the back however this was just too short in the front my belly button was exposed and that wasnt the look displayed on the model unfortunately this top is going back to the store
1,typical action movie where the main hero is such a badass the no one can stop him full of clichés since we have a lot of episodes we have time to see them repeated a few times of course the main criticism is the plot yeah the main idea is fine but the details matter the bad guys are so smart until they become so dumb that they have to die in pain didnt read any of the books so i dont know how much of the fault is from the author and how much from the screen writers but there are a lot of stupid things or very unplausible that happens from time to time as usual shut down your brain and enjoy the action
1,wednesday was an average experience for me the sound and visuals were okay but the plot was too predictable and the twist and climax were easy to anticipate some people compare this series with harry potter but dont even think about it jenna ortega did a great job and her performance was awesome some of the other supporting actors were good but jenna stole the show she was the only reason i kept watching the entire series maybe you came across this series through some insta reels this series is good for beginners who are starting to watch shows for the first time i have heard that the second season has been announced and i hope they will improve the quality of the show by adding a better plot and character depth
1,i was so excited about these pants but they were a total disappointment in person the fabric is a rough gauzy texture the bottom has a big hem that weighs down the pants and makes them hang funny like you are walking on stilts or something they do not hang or move well on the body also they are very long but small in the waist and have a high crotch so the fit is pretty off sadly these are going back
1,lcd display is not good
1,as a massive fan of tlou games i was very excited for this though the casting choices made me scratch my head based on appearances alone however most of the cast have proven themselves very capable thus far bella ramsey and nico parker who play ellie and sarah respectively despite not looking anything like the original characters absolutely knocked it out of the park and nailed the roles bellas performance makes me hopeful for the rest of the series the main outlier and main concern of mine so far is surprisingly pedro pascal pedros performance as oberyn martell in game of thrones was fantastic and he quickly became one of my favourite characters however his performance as joel seems to be a little lacklustre or perhaps miscast joel miller is a very nuanced character an extremely vulnerable and broken man who developed a stoichardeneddetatchedbitter front after his tragic loss i am not feeling that level of depth from pedros performance so far he just seems a little reserved and aggressive that opening scene in tlou game made me extremely emotional to the point of tears in every playthrough the tv version felt underwhelming by comparison outside of nicos incredible performance im excited to watch the rest of this series but i do hope pedro leans more into the role of joel as the show progresses also to the reviewers insulting gamers for their passion for video games please try to develop a prefrontal cortex at some point in your lives
1,stopped working in months
1,i really didnt care for this soup at all sorry to say it was a throw away a waste of time ive enjoyed others better
1,do not buy this if you are looking for a sign here it is its silver in colour nobody can call it a rose gold laptop lags a lot the processor cannot handle any heavy software please do not buy this

1,unfortunately it wasnt accepted at allthe engine is also quite noisyunfortunately i cant recommend it at all but every baby is different
1,really cute sweater well made but so intensely itchy i couldnt keep it on for more than seconds
1,i should have read the reviews first before ordering this top buyers beware you will not get the same top delivered to you as is shown in this picture the top i got delivered does not have the little straps at all and while there is a bow in the back the back sides do not come together the same to form the bow i hate to write a bad review but come on retailer id never expect this from you it looks like any other peplum white top not something special like the picture is o
1,i followed this recipe exactly and would never made this dish again everyone who tried it thought it was missing something and i agreed maybe green peppers or ground mustard
1,got this at k in sale writing after a month of use processor is good for daily use battery is pathetic doesnt rotates more than degree atleast must be degree display is crisp but sound is low very heavy in weight
1,this dress is beautifully made but it does not flair slightly as in the photo it stick out like a tent it might be a good maternity dress the fabric is somewhat stiff andheavy with a slight texture
1,the shirt is beautiful but fits much too small the stitching limits the space in your shoulders and the hem too short a petite frame would be able to pull this off but i am a medium and the shirt didnt work in every direction
1,terrible never cooked through even after hours i checked to make sure i had added all ingredients correctly so sad it had such good reviews the part that did cook was super bland i will definitely be trying another recipe
1,went in to wednesday not expecting much and it turned out to be very good i think the biggest reason is two of the stars jenna ortega as the deadpan wednesday and the outstanding gwendoline christie as fashionable yet acidly sweet principal weems these two along with an ok cast great sets and fantastic costume make this rather thin murdermystery keep you engaged also the whole concept of nevermore academy is just a rip off of hogwarts in this case for outcast that covers vampires wolves sirens and gorgons that part of the story and the supernatural elements is deficient to say the least yet this is much more a tween oriented series so on that basis wednesday is much better than a lot of other series out there
1,i was surprised retailer decided to ship this sweater the sweater looks like its falling apart and it is huge i would not recommend this even at a clearance price
1,extremely disappointed with this top it runs extremely large im lbs c and usually wear between a xss tops at retailer i ordered a and it looked like a maternity top on me the bottom half of the top flared out and did not fit close to the body at all fabric was also a gauzelike material that was not soft unfortunately i will be returning
1,very good quality laptop i like it this product
1,i bought this online so didnt realize that the fabric at the bottom is very very stiff i was expecting something silky or at least on the softer and more moveable side the best description i can think of is an overly starched mens dress shirt that being the case it kind of juts out in weird places the sweater part is very nice but it is somewhat closer fitting than what it seems in the picture the fabric bottom is too ample for the slimmer design of the sweater which just adds to the o

1,i love the colors and style of this poncho however the fabric is a total miss it is so scratchy i developed a serious rash within the first hour of wering it also unfortunately the fabric is not woven tightly so the poncho does not keep you warm the wind whips right through it it is disappointing that while the styles of retailer have remained top the quality of their clothing has steadly gone down the hill i hope retailer will put more effort in bringing the quality back
1,this show is light fun funny and even though the characters have a crappy time in the retreat it still makes me wanna go on holiday armand is definitely my favorite he is hilarious
1,very small so disappointed they did not even have a size for me to exchange a day later when they arrived
1,hellogreat card great price plenty of speed and worked forabout a year in fact i wish it had stopped working a month earlierit looks like sandisk is out to make sure their cards stop working perfectly after the return window is up or something because now on the end of december return window expired about days ago this thing only intermittently is recognized it unmounts all the time in my phone and then gets remounted and usually it doesnt even remountwhile it was a good price it was a good price for a name brand card that would have lasted longer than a year instead of sandisk going ahaha got you good now you have to buy another expensive namebrand cardnope ill buy a cheaper alternative and itll probably last longer i still have some kingstons going strong

1,this card continually unmounted in my s it was really painful when i remounted the card i sometimes retrieved my files sometimes not i have to say though that a card test in my pc using crucial diagnostics went fine my gut feel is that the card overheats and shuts down in the s although i have no proof of this what i do know is that it didnt work for me and many others google it naturally amazon refunded me the purchase cost when i returned the card gotta love amazoni now have a samsung g card and no problems so far i like sandisk but theres a compatibility problem here with the s

1,i had my eye on this dress for months i came into some extra cash and bought it at full price online and picked it up in the store the purple pattern is nowhere near as soft as pictures it was very bright which disappointed me its also made for more busty women at a d i could in no way fill this dress out the result made it look so frumpy and unflattering i felt like an old lady in a bag

1,i purchased this item in the gray heather color and loved it so much i wanted to buy every other color the fabric was cottony and felt very soft and cushy against my skin and the gray color was from the combination of black and white fibers i ordered the light gray and the red online and could not wait for them to arrive but the other colors were not even in the same material but a very shiny and synthetic feeling fabric with just a single color weave that did not have the same feel or tex
1,the fabric was nothing special i usually like a cottonsilk blend woven fabric but this was stiff feeling and the pattern was cute but what made me return it was the fact that the rose gold glitter dots are puffy paint literally puffy paint and the dots were not quite dry on my top when it arrived parts of the paint came off on my fingers and the top was stuck to itself because of it i could barely unfold it im sure this could have been cute but who wants a top that looks lik

1,this top is very soft and well made for my short and curvy figure it is very unflattering i considered altering it but there is no way to do it it gapes in the front and if you have a waist at all it wont show because this top is boxy and full in that area if you are tall and slim it might be perfect so give it a try

1,mike white please dont make any more white lotus seasons the third one was pathetic and it felt like youre just milking a cow which is not there anymore first two seasons were amaaazing but this one was so horrible story nope twists or shocks nil captivation nada mike white must go back and watch the previous seasons and see the complexities and storytelling that was captured in the last two seasons the story was the main appeal and pull whereas in the third season you cant just throw a lady with a funny accent totally copied from catherine ohara in schitts creek or a woman talking about mercury retrograde and expect that to be of any entertainment value its not just the intro that was ruined in the third season it was the series that got ruined for me

1,im lbs and ordered a large it fit but the arms were awkwardly short the finish details on the end of each sleeve almost would have to be pushed back to the elbow for it to look right which would be okay however the interior seam of the neckline is cut jaggedly and isnt even finished with any stitching its just tucked haphazardly inside the neckline and isnt sewnit would unravel with washing its soft and snuggly and cute if you get it on supersale and dont mind it com

1,i loved the look of these pants in the pictures online and i loved the way that they fit however when i got my pair the flower placement was completely different the whole front was black and there were just flowers running out of the crotch seams i ordered another pair hoping they were just cut wrong but those were even worse they looked obscene
1,i love this serie hope for more the wednesday interpretation by jenna ortega is expectacular and the side characters are great the addams are one of my favorite of all time and tim burton directing is a need to see the story is about wednesday adventures a book story to be published the friends wednesday have and the past stories she discover were great some mystery to solve and some lives to save nevermore academy is a good theme for monsters and outcast to ensure more chapters in this series i really recommend this series and enjoy watching it with only chapters is a great weekend view
1,the mrs loves this lotion however the new pump is absolutely a terrible design our lotion travels throughout the house during the day and because of this new pump we now have tiny lotion spots on nearly all of our surfaces as you can see from the picture with both sides of the pump looking exactly the same its quite easy to pic the wrong side when needing a quick pump also we were wondering why youve decided to deny us of the last lotion in the bottle by making the top a fixed piece instead of removable thanks
1,the description is quite confusing it says at same time class which means that you should not expect write speed higher than mbsec and at the same time it says uhs which means mbsec write speed the truth as usually is somewhere in the middle but close to lower end i have a dedicated high speed pcie cardreader which i use for chip benchmarking so this card showed mbsec sequental write speed and mbsec sequental read speed so uhs is true only for read operations meaning that if you wanted this card to speedup your digital camera speed photography youve made the wrong choice just for reference this cardtranscend gb class microsdhc flash memory card tsgusdhchas sequental write speed of mbsec and sequental read speed of mbsec as you see the cheaper transcend has average faster write speeds

1,sound is very less
1,s hawaii usa vibe satirical quirky emotionally uncomfortable pros it set the tone funny dark and brilliantly awkward cons it felt more experimental limited character development and some found it a bit slow s sicily italy vibe sexy mysterious and emotionally charged pros beautiful setting complex characters and the themes of sexual politics and power dynamics really hit cons overemphasis on sexual tension and unrealistic character behavior s ko samui thailand vibe spiritual philosophical multilayered pros it dives into identity generational trauma and spiritual disillusionment with stunning cinematography cons its a bit slower and more introspective conclusion if you like scandal and tension season if youre into satire and cringe drama season if youre into layered storytelling and big ideas season

1,connectivity issues with the product poor display quality delicate to handle
1,i probably should be used to not agreeing with the masses by nowbut really thought this was going to be so much better given all the hype i thought the acting was mostly very good but the story line was boring didnt go anywhere parts of the narrative were just downright tedious one thing that baffles me is inclusion of the trainee who in ep it felt like she was going to be a part of the storyline and there was too much drama around it and then it was irrelevant and so disconnected from the rest of the series aside from armond having a crisis of conscience which felt weak not built on
1,way too much salt

1,sooo disappointed with how flimsy this fabric is i think this is the thinnest of all clothing items i have ever come across anywhere in my life this is really a shame because the colors are stunning and it is a nice shirt style another con is if you have any bit of back fat it shows every lump and bump i do not recommend unless you have a lean back and the cost was
1,missing feature of backlit keyboard
1,i watched prior to watching the first season of ys because some of my friends recommended it i really enjoyed so i was expecting something similar with ys it was not to be one is a nicely done long film the other is more like a rural version of dallas or even the godfather but with lesser performances i like watching shows that are a bit more realistic something that could happen i expect the writer will have some liberties with stuff that simply isnt possible but when it becomes more and more common then i lose interest i watched seasons and that was enough for me it started out good then it just played out like one of those one hour crime investigation shows where there is no or some absurd explanation on how something happened one example is the murder of the ny reporter by jamie any coroner worth their salt would be able to tell it was no accident she was strangled and if that was the case they could have checked her mobile ping logs to see where it was that day it was just dismissed as an accident i mean this family murders like its a hobby and they get away with it murdering people for simply not wanting to work in your ranch i want to say that is not very common but then again i didnt grow up in a ranch i guess you can say its like a gang once you are made you cant leave only there are no tattoos they brand you other over the top scenes like the shootouts i mean you can send the navy seals to take out john dutton and they are not match for his ranch crew even john took out a special forces bodyguard with just a wine bottle hell they should probably train all military in a ranch by doing ranch work best way to prepare them for battle then there is beth she can basically take on the biggest corporations somehow halfway drunk i mean people listen to and do what she says simply because she is a dutton imagine if the duttons set their eyes on taking over the nation god help us we are doomed the only noble character seems to be chairman rainwater whose people really got screwed by jake dutton i mean i declare this land to be mine and mine alone and somehow natives have to respect that because a white guys says so rainwater should just attack the duttons with wipe them out then take over the land i mean it seems murder is a way of life in montana and nobody really cares then again the duttons can probably take on hundreds of marines and come out on top

1,believed i would be watching wednesday addams trying to assimilate into her own kind for episodes holy shitha was i wrong there isnt a medium tim burton isnt successful and jenna ortega is absolutely brilliant the story twists and turns to the last episode and you will sit up and scream no way camera work settings and the other actors compliment and interact with pure magic this is a intricate murder mystery thru the eyes of tim burton that will shock scare and delight you as heart pounding roller coaster ride enid is fantastic and the perfect yang to wednesdays yin tyler is such a great character and how exciting to see ms turnbull will watch this again and again
1,i started watching wednesday this year with a somewhat skeptical mindset i initially thought it would be just another typical teen series with a dark vibe but it turned out to be quite the opposite the show quickly shattered my expectations the protagonist wednesday addams is so unique that she almost provokes a lovehate relationship there were moments when i found myself thinking okay this is where shes going to falter but it never happened having watched plenty of teen dramas i kept anticipating the usual tropesthis is where she falls in love this is where she asks for help this is where she begs someone to staybut those moments never came wednesdays unwavering nature is both frustrating and refreshing defying the expectations set by so many shows in this genre another aspect i appreciated was the supernatural element i expected the show to be more grounded but the supernatural was woven into the story exactly where it needed to be it wasnt the focal point of the series yet it remained essential to the overall development this balance allowed the series to maintain its unique charm while still delivering on the dark quirky essence that fans of the addams family would expect in the end wednesday is far from the typical teen drama i anticipated its a series that stands out in its genre with a protagonist who never conforms to expectations and a storyline that cleverly integrates the supernatural without overwhelming the narrative

1,i see a lot of reviews saying the script is great dont see it cinematography is great ok it looks good and it so not star wars well guess what i love star wars im so ive loved it all my life i also love movies and tv shows good ones ones that have interesting characters this doesnt great dialogue this doesnt it feels laboured and dull its like star wars if it was an icelandic police drama on netflix i was immediately suspicious when they released eps on launch its because literally nothing happens they knew if they showed eps and without where things do start to move at least then it would flop well after episodes im tapping out for the first time ever in this franchise ive watched and enjoyed everything from the holiday special to last jedi and beyond hopefully someone will release a film cut like they did with obi wan then maybe itll be more palatable but for now im done bring on mandalorian in february
1,loved this dress when i tried it on in the store and thought it would be perfect for a casual wedding unfortunately the day of the wedding the zipper split and i had to wear something else it fit well but was poorly made based off other reviews this isnt the first time this has happened with this dress not worth the risk at all

1,the show has a lot going for it wednesday is certainly an intriguing character thing is great reimagined with cgi the artists did a fantastic job but for some reason the writers decided to take and make what monster species characters is and make it an allegory for gender identity or orientation which doesnt really work its one of those things thats so poorly managed i cant see people on either side of these issues appreciating the way theyre presented the murder mystery and monster hunt is rather interesting however the subplot with her parents doesnt make any sense neither does whats happened to gomez who was incredibly fit in the original there is a lot of manufactured drama which also hurts the show situations and motivations that seem contrived to create drama and drag the story out in many cases the major arcs could have been handled without any of the added drama and it would have been a better plot overall if the writers focused on the story instead of checking boxes or manufacturing drama that isnt there then it would be a great show

1,having read some of the reviews on here i was fully expecting this show to be a complete dud but decided to give it a try due to the awards it has picked up how wrong i was i think both seasons have been fantastic i love how all the characters have their flaws exposed normally filmmakers and individuals try to cover those flaws or minimise them but here they are laid out to be be feasted on by the audience we all know that no one leads a perfect life and here we have primarily tourists although some staff and locals too exposing their thoughts and acts out to us in addition to the brilliant characterisations we have sumptuous locations in both seasons that all add to the bacchanalian feast i love how both seasons build up to a crescendo where i get the sense of characters just feasting and gorging on each other until its just all too much i cant wait for s episode to drop at the weekend to find out more im recommending this show to everyone i know as long as theyre ok with nudity etc love it

1,yellowstone stands out in the tv landscape with its fresh approach to storytelling and a clear departure from the contemporary hollywood formula the series masterfully created by taylor sheridan and john linson is a testament to originality and a bold statement against conformity kevin costners portrayal of john dutton is not just a performance its a masterclass in character depth and complexity the shows narrative is a breath of fresh air offering a unique perspective on the american west that is rarely seen in contemporary media it challenges the norms and presents a narrative that is unafraid to tackle difficult subjects headon the shows lack of adherence to the expected tropes of hollywood culture allows for a more genuine and unfiltered exploration of its themes yellowstone is a celebration of the untamed spirit of its setting mirrored in its storytelling approach that respects the intelligence of its audience and refuses to dilute its message for broader appeal in essence yellowstone is not just a television series its a cultural phenomenon that redefines what a tv drama can be its commitment to authenticity and storytelling excellence makes it a standout show that resonates with audiences looking for substance over conformity

1,this dress has pretty colors the top fit well but the bottom looked like an upside down umbrella it has enough material to make skirts and the big pockets on the sides make the skirt stick out sideways the photo of model is from side not the front very unflattering on me
1,this is the highest rated recipe on the whole site hamburger and potatoes swimming in processed cheese and loaded with calories carbs fat and sodium this looks like hamburger helper only someone forgot the pasta and threw in potato chunks ground beef swimming in melted processed cheese is the best of the best im surprised the instructions didnt suggest dipping some mayonnaise on white bread sandwiches in it to complete the theme
1,disappointing this recipe calls more liquid than most of other hot milk cake recipes because of numerous good reviews i didnt doubt to try it i baked twice followed the exact method exact scale of ingredients but both didnt turn out well note that i didnt overwhip the eggs or overfold i went to a baking academy and ive been baking for more than years if youre looking for fluffy hot milk cake definitely do not try this recipe if youre up to really dense dense cake maybe you could try this recipe maybe this is why you shouldnt take recipes from the internet i highly doubt these good reviews are real as the youtube views for this recipe is considered low i wont be making these again ill try to find other hot milk cake recipes
1,wifi and bluetooth not working but mentioned in product specifications display quality much poor
1,while i love the fabric and the pattern this skirt leaves too much to be desired the full price is absurd considering what you get there is no mention online that there is no built in slip and as the material is extremely thin a slip is an absolute must see attached photo even in dim lighting you can see straight through also for this price point it is strange that the skirt is pullon styling i would say that it is true to size and i am usually a medium retailer but i have a sm
1,there were some funny moments however the stroppy teenage daughter is so overdone at this point the music was overbearing the image had a yellow tint the entire time it does not suit the theme of hawaii the ocean often looked green because of the yellow tint there were some funnyawkward moments but other than that this was a waste of time as it allowed for no investment in any of the characters and the storyline was painfully slow the ending was very anticlimactic the fact that the first episode drew you in to this murder and then when you see the ending it was pathetic
1,light in keyboard not available dont buy this laptop
1,i would not recommend this card if your looking for real class write speeds the most i could get is mbs from this card but for the most part it was about mbs i even did a slow format to exfat in windows with no improvements i copied over music pics and movies to test it out ranging from a couple of mb to over a gb the read speeds were pretty good at around mbs though i popped in a gb class transcend sd card and it consistently got mbs write speeds and mbs read speeds so in conclusion i think this card is not really a class too bad i read all the negative star reviews after the fact but i will be sending this one back
1,i ordered this in blue and the color is absolutely gorgeous i really loved it until i put it on wow it was bad i ordered a smallnormally a smmed due to bust but this was so wide and had so much material it wasnt long but rather incredibly boxy one of the most unflattering things ive ever tried at retailer

1,this top was way too short im only and way too wide the cut of this top was so wide it looked like a tent on me i really wanted to love this top because the material and style sleeves ruffle are beautiful unfortunately there is something wrong with the cut ive have several blouses made by one fine day which fit nicely for some reason this top did not i ordered in my usual s size even going to an xs would not work because the cut is wrong
1,wow exciting a much hyped good looking and edgy new crime drama can this pull me away from unsatisfactory emails and muted responses to my spontaneous facebook posts i relax and stare at the high definition screen diligently thrown into a dirty industrial post ww birmingham struggling for opportunity devasted by the horrors of the most critical war in history and acutely aware of the quick riches to be made in vice we follow the fortunes of the shelby family ruthless savvy and turned out with surprisingly good suits and haircuts can their struggle satisfy the demands of my humdrum easily bored and passive life not short of intreague communists police government forces rival gangs the church aristocracy and some mysterious russians amongst others all whisper cahoot shout shoot steal and kill in a violent and complex web of crime seduction lies and murder sensorarily and emotionally you will be bombarded characters built up to be wholesome are mercilessly butchered and the brummy tongue transports you away from familiar guy ritchie sherlock holmes cockney london into a bustling urban population gasping for an identity of their own powerful performances do keep you gripped most notably paul anderson as troubled arthur destructively battling his demons head on never quite finding a path to salvation the sometimes brutal deaths of innocents not to mention the often brutal and vicious deaths of the guilty form a dark cloud over developments murder near murder and beatings become common place often uninspiringly used as a plot mechanism the main characters in spite of what we know about their level of involvement in the latest nefarious plan have no release outlet or spiritual motivation not one character breaks the mould of a tortured individual paralysed either by duty or fear reluctant moll facing a moral dilemma or a key decision maker weighing up politics and the bigger picture and so they whisper cahoot shout shoot steal and kill into further turmoil before the grand resolution which shelby leader tommy cillian murphy is burdened with all collective hope to make it good what troubles me is that because the lead characters are so torturously greyscale i find it hard to justify the ultraviolent scheming and totally immoral lifestyle they choose for every life tommy shelby saves countless die some he kills with animalistic brutality by his own hands the palpable relief felt by the audience at the end of each climax isnt that of joy hope or victory merely satisfaction that a tumultuous catastrophe has been averted and the characters youve been rooting for are more or less intact peaky blinders leaves me entertained though morally perplexed despite its style and good acting i feel unrewarded it certainly distracted me from a life far removed from the shelby post great war birmingham canals though ultimately im no happier or informed and scarred with vivid graphic images of murder and death
1,fully money wasted
1,agree with above review these are described totally wrong they are not rise they are very high rise so much that i didnt even try them onthe color isnt good either it looks like a cheap levis color or just not a quality denim if you like high rise you might like them i cant comment on fit
1,i tried this dress on in the store i loved the fabric and color but the fit was huge no matter how much i sized down there are full dresses and tunics that are supposed to be loose but this was shapeless in an unflattering way i was attracted to the style and color but the execution left much to be desired
1,mother board gives trouble
1,the dress is beautiful in pictures but all the reviews are dead onit was full of snags when it arrived snags to be exact and the fabric was heavier than i expected sadly had to return

1,i bought the bronze color which was nice but the cut just hung like a dust rag no fit no drape very unfinished looking though i bought it on sale on sale it is not worth keeping over all it was not a worthwhile blouse to keep

1,dont expect this kind of product from dell completely disappointedfrom onwards i will not recommend dell laptop to anyone
1,i wanted to believe that those people who wrote bad reviews on memory cards were just unlucky well it sucks being one of them i cannot get this card to format not matter what device software or technique i use the mistake i made was that i didnt use the card right away to see if it was good i thought its a memory card what could go wrong now im out of the us and returning it is not economically sensible i dont know if its quality control but this card simply cannot work in any reader device with or without adapter write protection off on the reader of course the card shows up on devices may even show data being copied then when you refresh nothing has happened all formatting software says its write protected and nothing i do can remove it why would a new card come write protected anyway very disappointing especially since i lost data from my phone

1,i dont normally review my purchases but i was so amazed at how poorly this dress was made i couldnt help myself but to post a review the neck line isnt even hemmed down so it flaps up the material is thin and feel cheap this dress isnt even worth in my opinion i was expecting a well made good quality dress for the high price tag
1,the flipkart is reducules and the flipkart is very waste
1,this skirt is beautiful fabric is gorgeouswith perfect amount of shine and luxury to it there is a life in this skirt it is well made and follows the body lines in a perfect way ori better say it did fit me perfectly first ten minutes of wearing it unfortunately it stretched more than a full size and generally lost its shape now the skirt is two sizes too large and not really wearable anymore
1,its a great escape of reality and a perfect show to start bingewatching it took me a few episodes to really get to love the show but with each episode i grew more and more fun of their way of telling the story henry cavill does an amazing job and i cannot wait to see whats more to come in the world of the witcher
1,this is the worst shirt i have ever tried on from retailer it is basically a big shaggy box from the front and from the side it looks like a tent it is also short
1,what did i just watch i want my time back i went into it with some expectations thanks to the relatively high rating and the non stop talk about it on social media but this deserves no more than a a show for when you have absolutely nothing to do and you dont expect anything going in the overall story line hotel chain and a dead body is entertaining enough but i was left confused and waiting for the drop that never came didnt happen in s didnt happen in s is this meant to be a parody is this meant to be a dark comedy not funny at all and no point they tried to be artsy but failed there is no likeable character every single one is meandisrespectfuldumb andor cringe i guess the hooker that could sing was the best one of them all the first season is just one loooooong cringe fest the second season is a bit less cringe but overall boring and slow so slow so many better things out there that would actually deserve this hype this one aint it if you want cringe but good cringe go watch succession this is the best new show i have watched in years i cant recommend this one enough if you want comedy with some good cringe go watch arrested development if you want a whowhy murder mystery with some actual beautiful scenery that does artsy well big little lies season basically anything else is better than this imo i will never rewatch this i will never recommend this i really cant believe the hype
1,the white lotus has exploded on tv and has garnered a lot of conversation about its sharp writing and interlocking stories that skewer wealthy elites it made sense to watch it and see if it lived up to the hype and sadly it didnt for me a lot is being made about it being a satire but each review in that vein seems to be missing what satire actually is yes these are all rich people who behind the curtain are all narcissistic and miserable but thats not satire in and of itself over the course of their stay at the resort we are meant to believe they learn something and become better but really they are just as hollow as when they started my biggest issue is how unlikeable everyone is either through their choices or their position and they keep making horrible decisions and hurt themselves and the people around them without transforming themselves or our perception of them at the end of the first season we see a woman give up on life and decide to stay in a loveless marriage in the second we see a serial adulterer trick his wife into taking him back am i supposed to like these people if not what am i supposed to think about them this reminds me of so many romance novels that come out each year to much popularity its set in an exotic location and filled with extravagance we hate the characters because we arent them and theyre all awful and the show wants us to both hate and empathize them them while failing to pull that off the best thing the show does is convince you its deeper and smarter than it actually is
1,this dress will unfortunately be returnedso cute online and looks like a sack in person runs very large arm holes are very low not flattering
1,with in a month too many lines on my screen and i tried to contact customer care no one is responding properly worst hp service i spent k hard earned money and with in a month too many lines on screen worst product
1,the print and front ruffle are beautiful the sleeves are awful and poorly represented in the picture of the model its almost like the sleeves have a life of their own so mismatched with this style of blouse such a beautiful print but so disappointing in shape

1,i am a size and the skirt fit however it is so thick and voluminous it looked like a pirate sack its unfortunately going back
1,i dont know how anyone can like thisit smellstastes like weed with vinegar
1,i dont normally write reviews but this shirt was so terrible that i felt inspired first off the seam that is in both the front and back of the shirt is much more pronounced than in the photo secondly there is no shape whatsoever unlike in the photo it bells out like a tent it honestly looks like a shirt you would buy if you were trying to appear pregnant when not overall this shirt is an insult to the female form retailer what is with all of these shapeless frocks in cheap f

1,got this in the blue and was so excited while it looks cute someone had clearly bought this worn it and returned it it had human and dog hair all over it not to mention some kind of red strings it was pilling all over so much for quality control i dont mind buying used things but at least clean it up and give me a discount
1,this is very cheap in quality and the service is very very poor its my humble to every one plz dont buy this product buy another brand
1,bad product waste of money
1,i purchased this laptop and it is not opening after charging for a long time zero customer service provided by medium flipkart
1,this laptop is very bad and is worth
1,i was excited to get started on this series given the good reviews id seen but nothing actually happens in this show each episode is more boring than the last there are no likeable characters which may have been the plan but couldnt wait for this to end doubt ill be rushing to watch season
1,value for money
1,i thought they at least had a descency to say goodbuy to henrys geralt properly or include some cool action scenes in the last episode nope instead they included some unnecessary annoying characters unneeded scenes and huge plot gaps tissaias character is completely wasted she supposed to be a strong and powerful figure instead she is depicted as a weak teenage girl weeping for some dude yennefer was built as an everpowerful witch in the first season and her character is completely wasted as well suddenly the elves are so powerful while they resembled some homeless tribe during the first two seasons ciri is i dont know what she is overall the only good thing about this tv show was cavill and his representation of a witcher since he is no longer in it i will not watch it also hissrich ruined all female characters in this show by horrible writing and poor casting choices
1,dont buy not thin and light too heavy slow performance my ryzen with gb works much faster
1,i followed the recipe exactly except that i omitted the nuts the dough is so dry it wont hold together i added tbsp of water i was expecting a much much nicer tasting and nicer looking cookie i went with this recipe because of a the reviews and b the ratio of oatmeal to flour will never make them again i got dozen buttons about diameter i see the other reviews and shake my head as to what went wrong maybe i should have added another egg or two but wont bother trying this recipe again sorry
1,nice product but windows not use
1,this is not the reimagining of the wednesday addams now she is like a broken heart girl who wears punk fashion without any addams dna the addams are close to each other in the family because they have their lifestyles which are different from the others but dont make them lonely they have friends and fun activities and are not afraid of sad emotions tim destroyed the addams by giving them the loser character to all the family and making them normal so please find the version or some cartoon and feel free to watch it then you will see what i mean and you will understand how funny this family
1,its not shakespeare but its a lot of fun to watch good actors supporting a wellpicked lead who actually matches the character in the books no need for all the cgi one sees nowadays the fight scenes are fully believable willa fitzgerald is terrific as the diminutive but feisty partner of reacher there series actually takes the time to develop the characters hope theres a season in the works
1,the first season was great it was slow cringe and odd in a good way the second season was all that too but in a boring and extremely uninteresting way just skip the second season there is not much to be seen there if you for some unknown reason want to take a look at second season you can just watch episodes one and seven and make up an explanation for stuff yourself since its probably better than how it was on the show im dropping review because the first season would be around and the second at best dont know what happened because the writers had a great thing going on at first season and then someone got an idea that maybe they should make it suck on purpose or something
1,received this product with a gaping hole in it very disappointed in the quality and the quality control at the warehouse
1,i was very excited to find a fun and lightweight white dress for springsummer for the past two years i have found two of my favorite white dresses the material that this dress is made out of did not look high quality at all the fit looked more like that of an old nightgown this dress has no shape to it although probably comfortable not flattering i had high hopes for this dress and wish that it looked like it does in the picture in person

1,the image does not show but the front of the dress has a heavy utility zipper hidden with snaps the zipper pull when closed sat right on my collarbone which was he height of discomfort it felt heavy and awkward the dress was very high waisted for me im and it was inches above the navel also to the point of discomfort an invisible side zipper would have made the difference for me if the proportions were better suited for a nonpetite sizing the fabric is quite beautifu
1,product not good

1,granted that i am not as reed thin or as young as the model but i am tall and reasonably slender i have long hands and small wrists which would be a factor in the overall effect of this garment this poncho looked like some sad old stretched out whoknowswhat that youd keep in the car for emergency purposes in case you needed warmth if the car broke down in a snowstorm and i have one of those foldable reflective blankets in the glove box for that purpose i was looking for a statement
1,i was looking for a really warm but stylish coat that i could wear when the weather is frigid as it sometimes gets here in the dc area i tried on a size small which is my usual coat size while the coat fit it was not flattering for reference i am pounds and usually wear a smallxsmall in retailer tops in this coat i looked like a linebacker with pads on the front material is doubled which makes you look like you have a large protruding stomach the shoulders are bulky and

1,it draws you in with well timed cliff hangers but delivers nothing but senseless hurt hate self loathing and frankly an absence of self loathing when it should be present it drags you along for curiosity alone and never delivers even a shred of hope for humans i watched both seasons having hope that what the reviews and advertisements promised would be delivered in the end it is just dirt and shame covered by dollars drugs sex and glitter waste your time if you wish but you will emerge no better no more thoughtful and frankly left with vague disgust for how we portray the wealthiest of americans and also how foreigners interact with them i feel smaller and a bit dirtier for having watched the series
1,i have reviewed my rating to after watching episode a bunch of self entitled self absorbed people on holiday in hawaii acting badly there is nothing about this show i like other than the scenery not in the slightest bit entertaining just irritating as there is nothing to like about the characters i will not be watching any further episodes for those who persevere at least there are only episodes
1,the laptop is good but the screen resolution is not good also the sound is too low dont buy this product
1,i liked it but it took a while befor i watched it in that time it got hyped way more then it should make no mistake i like it and i am looking forward to the next season but i think its kinda slow i you ask me a little to much talking and doing nothing personally i want more action and a bit more fast paste its still possible to make good character building without making it of the series it gets boring after a while

1,having used sandisk before in my photography i of course went to them when it was time to outfit my new samsung galaxy s with an internal microsd card i spent the extra bucks over comparably no name micro sd cards and bought this variant i took quite a few pictures and even transferred an album from my computer so i coud show it to friends on the goafter less than two months the sandisk microsd card started acting up it was not recognized stopped restarted removed itself reinstalled itself onto the phone erratic behavior here is where i should have taken it out immediately and tried to recover anything i could before things hit the fanunfortunately i waited too long and this morning for no other reason than i turned my phone on the card shows up as blank neither my windows pc nor my mac can even detect the card and yes i tried two different adapters and i tried the sandisk recovery which found no recoverable files even though i checked all file type extensionsive apparently lost all the pictures i had on there to top it all off my gfs cheap no name card has never had an issue in her exact same phone and keeps chugging along merrilypaying a premium for a substandard product that fails in use after two months no thanks im going back to lexar which hasnt failed me yet im also getting rid of all my sandisk cards for my dslrs just in case the fact that sandisk is the first card thats ever failed on me and a new card to boot does not inspire confidence buy and use at your own risk
1,purchased for my android phone to provide more media storage the one i received was doa spoke with sandisk tech support who confirmed that it was a bad unit since it was within days they suggested i return it to amazon instead of going through warranty procedures i returned it to amazon but made the mistake of requesting a replacement instead of a refund the replacement appeared to work at first but after a short while it caused my phone to reboot files went missing and displayed other forms of instability it was a bit late to return again so i contacted sandisk who replaced the unit under the warranty however this all took a lot of time necessitated repeated copying of many gbs of data and secure erasing of informationthe warranty replacement from sandisk works well so far however im not seeing much improvement in my application over a similar gb class sandisk microsdhc this one is class would probably give the current unit stars but this rating is for the amazon delivered units both defectiveif you do get a bad one id suggest to return for refund not replacement
1,i loved the criss cross part of this tank however it looked so frumpy on the cut was just odd and if you are petite it felt like a tent i was so bummed because that criss cross was awesome but it just looked so weird on i returned it the material felt nice too

1,its a cute top but once i washed in cold water and laid flat to dry it shrunk and lost its shape very disappointed i am going to return top
1,review by someone who has never read the books or played the game but really enjoyed this series nonetheless first of all the polish in every aspect is fantastic the effects costumes and production are all top notch the performances are also brilliant particularly henry cavill as geralt this leaves two major things plot and action it delivers in both areas some of the choreography is phenomenal end of episode anyone and the use of magic leads to inventive strategies during battles the monster designs are also varied and interesting plot and character wise the show fully delivers on too once you realise its three separate timelines unfolding at once it has me invested in the fates of geralt yennefer and ciri the overarching storyline continuously developed within each episode overall i highly recommend watching
1,waste of money its not working
1,the print doesnt necessarily works for everybody
1,performance and capacity were not in line with cost and expectations these are most likely counterfeit or back door sales in my opinion very unsatisfied
1,i went into the white lotus with high expectations especially after all the buzz and critical acclaim unfortunately it was one of the most underwhelming and frustrating viewing experiences ive had in a long time the storyline is painfully dull and directionless it tries to present itself as a social commentary or a slowburn drama but it is neither insightful nor entertaining the pacing is excruciatingly slow with episodes dragging on without any meaningful development i kept watching hoping something would happen but it never did one of the most frustrating aspects was the overuse of music theres barely a scene without a dramatic or unsettling score playing in the background regardless of whether it fits the mood or adds anything to the scene it becomes repetitive exhausting and often unintentionally comical the cinematography also left me scratching my head countless shots serve no narrative or artistic purposelingering on objects zooming in on irrelevant scenery or panning aimlessly it gives the impression that the show is trying hard to be artsy without any substance behind the style the screenplay feels disconnected and at times completely nonsensical the dialogue is awkward and unnatural and the characters are shallow irritating or unlikable i found it difficult to care about any of their stories or outcomes they felt more like caricatures than real people and their interactions often lacked authenticity in the end the white lotus feels like a project that prioritizes aesthetics and pretension over storytelling and character development it tries to be clever and edgy but ends up being dull aimless and empty i honestly regret the time i spent watching it and i would not recommend it to anyone looking for a compelling or rewarding series save your timethere are far better shows out there
1,i got this card only a few months ago used it on a note now it has failed no matter what i try attempts to format the drive or edit the files on it whether using my computer or the phone have all failed the cards data is now essentially readonly which is the only saving grace of this since i could at least save my dataprevious to this i had an issue with it corrupting photos randomly with increasing regularity as it grew closer to complete failure i am now going to be avoiding sandisk when possible

1,absolutely in dismay once again some hollywood executive absolutely destroys something good by refusing to pay the lead actor as their salary expectations rise in line with the popularity of the series how wrong can you get it how on earth can anyone watch this series and not get that cavill makes it happen what an insane and absurd decision i hope that season three falls to the bottom pits of hell and is forgotten in the mists of time bring back cavill for season four you bloated hollywood big wigs he is the witcher there will never be another fans of fantasy of the world rise up and be heard

1,i would first like to say that every actor is a delight its so fun to see the adults and the young adults are talented but after a few episodes i felt like i was watching a cw teen show nothing special about the filming or script wednesday is a misfit in a school of misfits like what shes so much more entertaining around normal people who end up looking like the real weirdos the dance sequence that has gotten so much media coverage is actually quite good but watch it on youtube watch the first few episodes for the fun actors then walk away like i did this is a bore and is not worthy of the average imdb rating

1,an exiled child with family problems finds themselves thrust into a magical private school once there a mystery involving their parents magic and monsters creates whimsical narrative sound familiar wednesday answers the question no one asked what if the adams family went to hogwarts then changed it just enough to avoid plagerisim here wednesday is goth nancy drew solving the mysteries with constant thing ex machina well shot well acted monster looks like a cheap cgi garbage version of xtro stories are bland recycled highschool dramaharry potter plot points it aims more mature but falls flat in teen drama at times its rather insufferable pushed as a comedy its seldom ever funny many will enjoy this turn your brain off and you can think about it and its the same teen drama thats been on repeat on cable for years neither original or very adams family give it a shot but if your bored by episode pick something else the beat dosent change
1,out of smashed it absolutely amazing reboot spinoff i had my reservations about this show so gave it time until i watched it and now regret having wasted time not having seen it it is hilariously funny with all the normal tim burton spookykookyness as well as a great cast and brilliant story i did however pretty much guess the monster and the master twist but it did not dampen my enjoyment of this show i am thoroughly looking forward to the second season which is forthcoming this year i wonder if well get to see cousin it i would definitely recommend this to anyone who grew up watching the addams family films or shows

1,i saw this top online and ordered immediately i loved the color lace and unique details sadly it just arrived and it is a disaster the lace is stiff and doesnt lay softly and is very rough against your skin the style and i like shorter style tops is extremely boxy and the sleeves protrude outwards in a funny way that although i am so in love with this color i would be embarrassed to wear this top in public it could have been fantastic if the lace was softer and some a

1,i do not understand all the great reviews but that goes to show everyone likes different things the jacket looks great in the pictures but in person it just looks awful gray is one of my favorite colors but this color is so drab and the material looks old and worn it definitely has a grunge look to it and overall it is just a wrinkly mess another reviewer said it looks like old clothes and i have to agree it looks very shabby it also reminds me of those smocks they have at the hair salon

1,bhai it is terrible each time it stopped working become hang when i switched on it what i can do can anyone say they are not taking return though there have return date
1,thats pretty much the only reason why this terribly boring series lacks any textual or dramatic quality is highly praised this show poorly in anything anything at all watch this and waste hours of your life on a boring boring boring as hell show and when i say its boring im not saying that for hyperbole its because the show is really terrible imagine staring at your bedroom ceiling for hours thats what this show is all about not a shred of good writing here how this managed to be approved and aired by hbo on a channel that was synonymous with quality is completely beyond me in short just because its from hbo doesnt mean its good or even watchable time is precious dont waste it watching this pile of nothing with nothing
1,i couldnt even figure out how to wear this sweater the fit was so odd the arms cut off short and the seams dont hit your shoulders where they should all the extra fabric around the collar is just confusing and unflattering moving around in it was not easy i will return this one

1,i never really paid much attention to white lotus until it recently started trending on social media i figured i was missing out on something good so i decided to give it a watch well much to my surprise season was a snooze fest the story was so drawn out that i found myself forwarding through some scenes of nothingness the character stories were all pretty boring as well there was some funny and exciting stuff there but it didnt amount to anything really i ended season wondering what all the hype is about it took me about a week before i got the courage to give season a try and this is where i understood the trends surrounding this show much much more fun season the character stories actually go somewhere jennifer coolidge was much more likeable in this season it was exciting and every episode ended with you wanting more in fact i stayed up till nearly am finishing the season because i couldnt stop watching while on the other hand finishing season felt like a chore im glad the writers got their act together and im now very much looking forward to season
1,i am definitely in the minority here i really really disliked this recipe i made it exactly as stated using a bag of angel hair cabbage it was so wet i added a second bag and it was still too wet it was so sweet i added three tablespoons of horseradish and could barely tell i added any i gave up and took it to a gathering with a sprinkling of smoky paprika on top very little of it was eaten it continued to get more watery with standing and looked less and less appealing
1,i ordered the ivory of this dress expecting it to be a nice dress i could wear into my second trimester of pregnancy instead i received a dress that looks like a ugly vintagegonewrong curtain of fabric the ivory is the color of yellowed newspapers the fabric was cheap and had thread pieces sticking up all over the place i wouldve been better off sewing myself a dress out of drapes a la gone with the wind or sound of music the fit isnt that great either big and boxy it could acco
1,this runs sooo big i normally wear a large lb dd but due to the limited sizing small or medium i chose small because it looked big on the model and this style of dress seem to run large the size small that i ordered couldve fit two people easily together i loved the pattern color and the slip underneath actually fit well but i dont want to look like im wearing a tent lol also the back is slightly longer than the front something i couldnt see from the pictures online
1,waste of ordering laptop not turning on no battery indicator even when plugged in just time waste and money waste
1,i normally buy persil colour powder but as it seems unavailable i decided to try these and was not impressed it got the washing reasonably clean but did not remove stains from my babys nappy cream the smell is unpleasant and overpowering even after an extra rinse we do not use fabric conditioner as there was no need for it with the powder using these tabs the clothes dry cardboard hard and creased i will not be buying again

1,my suggetion is better go with other brandwith in year you will face a problem touchpad not working keybord mark on display
1,we enjoyed season one of the white lotus but it took a couple episodes to warm up to it still it had some good moments we didnt experience many out loud chuckles but it was entertaining and it was interesting to see what the next episode would bring if there was one character we could do without it was jennifer coolidge her on screen persona is the same in pretty much everything she plays but i guess she fits todays program interests some many things in the episodes were predictable but still it can be entertaining season two seems so flat and we keep waiting for things to get going the episodes are so full of clichés and not pulled off very well we keep waiting for some spark that kicks the program into high gear my wife is ready to pull the plug after three episodes but im a sucker and like to see how the season is played out if i even had a hint of how i would feel about the white lotus it would have been scratched from my list of shows to watch i cant see watching a season if the show makes it that far

1,the last of us has so much good in it the direction and cinematography the performances the production value the plot all of it is of an incredibly high quality higher than one may expect from a seemingly typical postapocalyptic television series so what then garners a rating as low as the one i have given simply put the last of us has some of the worst pacing i have ever seen in a mainstream tv show god how i wanted to love this series theres no denying that pedro pascal and bella ramsey are giving their all here both of them had me openly weeping at various moments due to the sheer emotional resonance of their performances however with all the quality and production value both in front of and behind the camera the last of us suffers from a surprisingly rushed pace the phrase too much but not enough comes to mind here especially considering the amount of flashbacks that this series contains i mean two episodes are virtually nothing but flashbacks and almost every single episode contains a flashback of some sort that grinds the current story to a halt so when a flashback isnt occurring the writers need to catch the story up leading to a two episode finale where the episodes are the two shortest of the entire show i mean whats up with that in a show about a proxy fatherdaughter relationship its unfortunate that said relationship takes up as little screen time as it does joel and ellie are the stars of the show and yet it feels as if they are the ones who are seen the least in the series and so when their inevitable bonding occurs it is unbelievable simply because the show devoted so little time to them and that to me is this shows biggest downfall i simply didnt believe the relationship between them because the series spends more time in flashbacks and with other characters than with the two people the audience cares most about truth be told the show spends so much time in the past that it feels like the present is an afterthought the reason the game series is beloved is because of the fatherdaughter relationship between joel and ellie the show forgets that for two whole episodes and ignores it for basically four to five episodes leading to a climax that while riveting is unbelievable due to the lack of proper build up and thats such a shame because pedro and bella are phenomenal in their roles additionally for a zombie series the show barely features any zombies the first few episodes have all the undead violence you can ask for but that all gets put on the backburner for the remaining episodes to focus on the true villains the people and while thats a novel idea it rings hollow especially during the last episode when it is finally revealed why the fireflies want ellie lets just say that the walking dead did it better the last of us has a lot to like but also leaves a lot to be desired the production value and overall quality is through the roof so its a shame that the pacing is as rushed as it is two or three more episodes wouldve worked wonders in building up the relationship between the two titular characters what we got wasnt bad per se but it wasnt nearly as fantastic as it couldve been
1,normally hd in paris brand is spot on for their dresses this dress is a big thumbs down as most of these reviewers and myself point out the large arm holes do not allow you to wear a regular bra because you dont just get a peak of your bra you get to see the whole side of it secondly the bust of the dress would work only for an acup bra too small for the average woman the only bright spot with this dress is the brilliant colors available and the quality of the fabric itself excelle
1,i didnt expect to have the first episode as good as this its not exactly like the game story there are few changes and modifications but still the overall look and feel is so close to the game which is lovely the game is so great that you cannot mock it yet they were able to do it very smoothly graphics music and locations is giving you the feel of believing the pandemic has actually come to real life in the game they never told us what is this all about they just start by telling us its out there unlike the series episode they actually told us some scientifically correct information about how potentially would this pandemic would came to existence
1,very cheap quality and heating
1,i wanted to love this blouse so much but try as i might it just fit so oddly on me im usually a petite s so i purchased the xs in brown first the color was more graybrown but it was still ok but second the fit was off maybe i just got a bad one but the center of the blouse was so offset that the slit in the front laid so far to the left and the vneck was so low that you could see my bra there was no adjusting i could do to fix it the material has a lovely soft silky feel to it an
1,i can say that sandisk is one of the best company in the fields of electronics and digital cameras but i am very dissapointed of this memory cardthe card memory is only gb and the speed is mbs which is not as advertisedi gave it to my dad to use it on his phone and i started to use the sony gb microsd i can say that it works perfectly the storage is gb and the speed is mbsbuy it now this is the exact link i used to buy mine

1,ut gives only fps on asfalt
1,battery performance is low max hrs run time in normal use
1,an enhanced soap opera set around an esteemed oversized ranch in montana where time has more or less stood still for a hundred years the series is like a cross between dallasdynasty and bonanza except there is none of the cozy atmosphere of the latter what we do get are the despicable characters and power struggles of the former written and delivered as soapy as they come the dutton family is supposed to have owned and run the yellowstone ranch for years but its really a wonder that there are anyone left there at all seeing as people seem to get killed or seriously wounded every episode its almost as if someone made this all up this is definitely not taylor sheridans best work watch hell or high water or wind river instead
1,this shirt would be perfect if i needed a canopy on my tent this shirt runs ridiculously large purchased a medium and it should be labeled an xl no impressed with the pattern in person looks cheap will be returning
1,very disappointed i loved this little otter everything was pleasant until its disfunction after a week the breathing mechanism stopped after a few seconds after a quick exchange the second otter was even more malfunctioning i had to ask for a refund this product is not to the point despite the good idea too bad my monthold son loved him

1,i didnt enjoy the texture or the taste of this dessert but my kids liked it
1,ive used this conditioner before and the smell was so intense tried this one in amazon because was a good offer and basically you cant feel the smell in your clothes it seems diluted so if you want some nice smell in your clothes please dont buy this
1,if you want to purchase any electronic item do not except any warranty or refund generally many sellers sell defective product on flipkart site and flipkart will cancel your refund for defective product the customer will have to struggle to move pillar to pillar for rectification

1,worst laptop for the money we have spent dont buy this waste peace
1,well i liked the show i really liked how they portrayed older wednesday addams and her relationship with her brother i also liked how they kept hand and that wednesday almost didnt blink throughout the whole show but the downside was that they overdid it with the supernatural the whole point of the addams family is that theyre unique in their oddness yet in the show half of the population is supernatural it also doesnt make sense for wednesday to be in a supernatural school since both her and her parents are completely human they are obscure and dark but not supernatural hand is supernatural and so is their butler the frankenstein monster in the original show but apart from that they are human
1,this device is not compatible with the latest windows h update shame
1,fortunately i got this as a lightning deal so it wasnt that expensive i purchased it in october but didnt start using it on my samsung galaxy s until january it was fine until it wasnt it chose to die today just a little more than four months after i started using it i checked my phone this morning and it told me that the sd card had been unmounted i did not think much of it but when i rebooted my phone and was still unable to find the card i began to be concerned when i got home from work i put a different card in and it worked fine i tried to check the card on my computer and it couldnt be seen so the problem is definitely a card unfortunately i lost most of the pictures ive taken since getting this phone i know that i probably should have backed them up but i really didnt expect the card to fail so quickly perhaps if id read all of the one start posts before buying i would have oh well back to my gb amazon class card until i can get a different oneim not even going to bother with a warranty claim i dont need another card that will fail after four months
1,this top looks beautiful online when i got it it looks nothing like the pic its wide too much fabric no shape and so unflattering its definitely going back

1,i generally dont write bad reviews but there is a real discrepancy between the quality of this kimono and the cost the design and colors are great but the fabric is ripping on all the kimonos on the rack in my store where the manufacturers tag is at the back of the neck the material is very thin so there are other small holes beginning throughout the garment i shop at retailer all the time and this is not a item of clothing
1,my laptop is in warranty and numlock keys are not working dont buy an asus laptop go for hp and dell both are best laptops because i was using dell laptop since still its working perfectly asus laptop is totally worse please i request dont buy asus laptops
1,this was a huge disappointment it does smell good so i am hoping that serving it hot with a scoop of ice cream may make it edible so it doesnt have to be dumped in the garbage i dont have extra in food budget to be throwing away food the stiffness of the batter is a cause for concern i am going to try to save this mess and will never make it again
1,i know im in the minority here but i am just not enjoying this show im on episode six and im just flat out bored and the music drives me insane i hate it so much that sometimes i mute the television and turn on closed captions i am not a jennifer coolidge fan at all so maybe thats part of it too because shes really annoying in the show

1,i was very excited about ordering this top as im tall girl ft and i like my back well covered i liked both style and design of the top on photo but when the package arrived i was very disappointed with the material this top is incredibly thin and see through though fabric is nice and soft it feels more like a pajama top all curves bumps immediately stand out and it doesnt look flattering i ordered colors grey and black size large and returned both although they were true to size
1,not working after opening the laptop
1,this is an adorable basic i should have been wearing it once a week this summer but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear this brand makes some of the softest cutest tees but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash i wash on gentle hang dry not worth the cost
1,we ordered these and used them in my galaxy note and my wifes razr m after a few months we noticed that they would cause the phone to freeze up the phones would start showing that it was mounting and unmounting the sd card early on but toward the end they just froze up the phone once we trashed the cards the phones worked fine we bought a different brand and no trouble since i dont know why these red gray ones have issues but stay away from them

1,average
1,very third class laptop
1,i dont like this product its not support for any apps
1,i was so excited to order this dress i loved that it had a normal neck nice length and there wasnt a hole in the back but this dress is just plain awful the top fit tight across the bust it flattened me out like i was wearing a too tight sports bra then the back zipper puckered and bumped up like there is too much zipper for the fabric i could not get the zipper to lay flat the fabric is itchy and very cheap feeling on top of it all the colors are much brighter than they appear in the
1,maybe if you have never seen the original series never seen the movies and you are really in to teen drama and magic well maybe you will like it but apart from the names of the characters and their appearances there is nothing that reminds one of the addams family at all no loving and caring family no humor wednesday is just a godawful meanspirited teenager flat personalities cgi is okay though and im sorry to say but catherine zeta jones and luis guzman what where they thinking there is no chemistry there at all flat personalities really bad acting but also god what were they thinking usually i would watch episodes to see if anything improves but this show is so far off the addams family its not going to happen
1,was really excited for this dress but should have paid more attention to the material it was made with for the price of the dress it felt very cheap i didnt even end up trying it on after i opened the packaging the colors were not as vibrant as the picture as another reviewer mentioned it was more similar to something you would purchase off a boardwalk very disappointed and will be returning
1,what a disappointment and for the price its outrageous
1,battery drain very fast dont buy this
1,i had such high hopes for this dress but unfortunately it misses the mark completely the design is flawed in that you cannot raise your arms to shoulder length for someone who is lbs the dress has no shape and looks like something from zoolanders derelict campaign i think one must have a specific body type for this dress but regardless theyll have to keep their arms at their sides
1,first delivery breath movements dont work second delivery engine is so loud i dont want to do that to my childunfortunately i was really looking forward to it
1,at the beginning of season i was really excited for what was to come the show looked great and i loved the location but it ended up being a letdown to me the show looked good was really good in terms of style but substance was really lacking it was just treading water for most of the season and the ending wasnt great some forced storylines and wasted characters jason isaacs talent was totally wasted after he got his news there was potential there but he was just drunkdrugged the rest of the season and was checked out disappointing alot of the other characters didnt have much development and were not all that interesting the season could have been so great but was just ok in the end
1,so original like nothing youve seen before has you on the edge of your seat and expressing emotions you didnt know you had loved it
1,i dont know what all the ravening is about this cake was not good at all made it yesterday i didnt think it was moist in fact it was a little dry and didnt have a taste i will not make it again
1,the video promises more than original totally disappointed
1,if you like magic monsters kings this a show not to miss you find people to hate people to love reasons to keep coming back for more every fairy tale or dream you didnt want to end
1,if you really feel this is so much like got are you really even a fan this story like is so much more different this story goes into the magical world of mages monsters and wizardry this has a great plot and phenomenal acting the casting is spot on the writing is exceptional graphicscgi are great i had trouble following along the story line there are many flashbacks and there is no warning you just find yourself confused until you figure it out i would give it a ten if i could follow easier also many curses potions and ruleslaws are used without any explanation this can be confusing as well i had to google a lot thank you reddit i cant wait for the second season to come i just hope its soon it really is a must watch
1,as per the product details ms office package is missing flipkart didnt respond and told me to apply for a replacement however flipkart rejected the replacement request based on the conversation recording available well try what can be possible legally
1,this show made me rethink this whole concept of reviewsi dont understand how other people watched this show and decided it was one of the best out therei mean imdb doesnt place it that highwhich is fantastically accuratebut it should have placed it waaay waaay lower the imdb rating is probably influenced by the talk in the streetswhich claims that this show is extraordinary and a great dramacomedyto call it a dramedy would be insulting the genre this show reminds me of successiontheyre both shows i want to likeshows i know am supposed to likebut i just dontand while i did give succession time and still didnt like itits impossible to give white lotus time the first minutes of this show is the most soul sucking boring nonsense ever producedit kept going from low to lowit has got to be a world recordevery scene is ten times worse than the last all the characters are annoying and unlovablethe comedy is atrociousthe dialogue is horriblethis show is probably worse than velma its poorly writtenpoorly thought outpoorly executedbasicallytheres nothing here
1,luckily i bought this on sale i now see the instructions online say to hand wash but i bought mine in the store the instructions on the tag said to wash delicate in cold water and tumble dry i washed it in cold water and it shrunk to doll size

1,i ordered this article for my baby it was born on january and it doesnt work anymore the otters breathing mechanism blocks and stops music and light we have to open the rear scratch and press the music behind so that it can work without breathing what a pity yet the idea is nice the otter is cute and the sounds are pleasant
1,i was so excited to find this shirt on sale at my local retailer store but i did not notice the high percentage of rayon in the fabric which caused the shirt to shrink significantly in the wash even when following washing instructions i washed it on cold with woolite and it is about half the length it was initially im so disappointed how can you make a shirt that cant withstand washing
1,camera is not working
1,i purchased this swimsuit in the mint gorgeous color combination im and weigh lbs i purchased a small the fit is true to size i love the front design however my husband promptly brought the back of the swimsuit to my attention the chevron was off center the design should have been centered with my back however it was on the right side of my back i immediately called retailer assuming the product was defective the item was sold out on line however a supervisor was able to l

1,its too much hanging issue waste of money not buy lenovo product at service center huge number off lenovo customer
1,battery backup is not good only hours
1,as there are so many positive reviews i almost did not bother but that would be unfair to such excellent storytelling acting set design and direction of this series it is very worth of bing watching as you try to solve the culprit or culprits through the series jenna ortega steals the show as wednesday and is obviously going to be a world class actress for the future there are scenes where you just feel there is no way she could have kept the wednesday poker face when filming them i think there would have been a lot of laughs making this the supporting cast are first class personally i enjoyed the direction of the series both light for comedy value and dark when required if you are not a tim burton fan this maybe a negative for you i would sum it up as harry potter meets fantastic beasts meets scobby do meets the adams family an absolute joy to watch do i want a second series very rarely do i say this but yes please with even more mystery than this one
1,this sweater was huge it hung down to my calves it also is really bulky and scratchy it feels as if you are wearing an old wool blanket i think it is only made for really tall and skinny people im and weigh lbs and i ordered a size s and i was swimming in it the fabric is very thick i may be great if you live in alaska or the arctic it adds about lbs to your body frame
1,i was excited for wednesday but felt really let down by this series adaptation dont get me wrong jenna ortega plays the part perfectly there isnt a better actress to fill riccis shoes still the show had a harry potter sabrina monster high feel to it i dont mind campy but it was a bit much poor casting for gomez hurt the epic romance of morticia and gomez i almost wish they wouldnt have been included jenna ortega was the only solid casting and the acting in the show is somewhat lacking it seems like this series is made to cater to kids and teens wednesday just doesnt live up to the hype
1,when i returned this the salesperson asked what was wrong w it bc it keeps being returned i got the black w the white collarcuffs i thought it was terribly itchy material which could be remedied w a shirt underneath but the white collar part was such a dull ugly whitedirty color maybe the other colors are better
1,just a ginormous shapeless shirt runs extremely large i am normally a medium to large in shirts and the medium was huge i can only imagine an xs would work and i am no xtra small
1,dont buy mistake very disappointed
1,worst product video display not good sound also not good not satisfied this product very much disappointed waste of money i hated this product worst experience
1,laptop and performance is good only speaker problem and sound quality is poor and worst lenova online support
1,the photo misrepresents how large this sweater is it is giant petite ladies stay away from this sweater i ordered an xs and usually can manage to fit in a regular xs but this just floored me the neckline wouldnt even stay up on my upper body it was that loose also the width of the sweater does not at all hug the body as shows on the model it is like a tent im so bummed the color blue is nice and the sweater is really soft its too bad it doesnt fit smaller women
1,teenage drama with interesting atmosphere too bad the plot is built to lead the viewer to conclusions that are later proved wrong the clues are sometimes subtle at other times very obvious but in the end theyre all red herrings this wouldnt be a problem if an attentive viewer could figure out whos done it but the twists come completely out of left field actually the viewer can sometimes foresee what happens next by paying attention to the clues and imagining what would be the most stupid and absurd plot twist that makes all clues and plot points completely misleading or useless these scenes completely prove x will happen but y would make for more drama and is completely unexpected so thats how the its gonna go the legal system doesnt make any sense caught grave robbing trespassing kidnapping and torturing get out scot free by the power of being the main character on the point of the main character i get what they try to give her a somber and morbid personality but after a bit it comes out just as an insufferable edgy teenager that always says the most unpleasant things that comes to mind just for the sake of being unpleasant i wanted her to be smart methodic pragmatic but no she sure is smart but get only other character trait is being unpleasant why are people trying to help out befriend her she only lies and mistreats everybody she doesnt do anything whatsoever for anybody at any point that to justify people wanting to be around her i expected that she would be insufferable but actually get things done for the good of others so they would be willing to help her along but no they only try to help and befriend her because the show would be boring without more characters the acting by some of the actors is sometimes so stifled and robotic that it sounds like a random person picked out of the street mocking a middle school childrens play thats specially obvious when compared to the main actress who completely nailed her part the actor that plays gomez and the actress that plays the principal all in all its just a morbid kind of comedic and poorly developed teenage drama that revolves around an outcast main character if you have low spectations or enjoy watching shows while playing on your phone this is well worth the watch
1,while the print is cute the fit is a disaster if you are a c cup or fuller the bottom band does not lay flat as pictured on the model it rides up under your boobs and the whole cup area tips forward its not really molded like a bra more flat foam insert immediately went back hopefully if retailer continues to do swimwear theyll take a look at adjusting the designs to make sure theyre also workable for fuller cup sizes underwire please
1,this is quite an odd dress it does wrap and is beautiful material however the dress does not close at all in the chest area i thought perhaps it was meant to be a kimono it will go back for sure
1,i hate this laptop the battery keep getting drained all my money got wasted please if you are reading this dont ever buy this laptop instead go for infinix one but done ever go for ultimus

1,after living in hawaii as a kid the beautiful scenery and the soundtrack which was filled with hawaiian songs wonderful but after just finishing the last episode in season one i am actually speechless seriously speechless im still trying to wrap my head around what i just watched i dont know if i hated it or loved it in a sick kind of way this is one of those shows you are either going to love or hate but if you decide to give it a whirl dont read the reviews first and whatever you do make sure the little ones in your life are not in the room while you watch the white lotus

1,i inserted this into my galaxy note powered the phone on and went into storage i pressed on mount sd card it said it didnt understand the filesystem and asked if i wanted to format it i did and then i saw gigs of free spaceworks great and got it for bucks off amazonconits extremely slow to write to if i try to write a gb file from my pc to the card it takes about minutes mb a sec if i write to the internal sd card on my phone it writes at mb a sec i dont understand why its that slow i can accept that it will be slower than an internal sd however i didnt know it would be dog slow my gb samsung micro sd was much faster
1,very poor products dont buy it after moose is not working
1,season pros baby yoda say no more the feel of the show gets better by episode i love the concept of the mandalorian pedro pascal is phenomenal as mando the final episode is fantastic sets s up perfectly cons first couple episodes were good but slow i felt overall the mandalorian is a superb addition to the star wars universe it certainly gave me the feels that the original trilogy gave me jon favreau should be given huge credit for essentially bringing this show to the screen i cant wait for s the first episode has just been released because this first season has really made me love star wars again quote this is the way mando rating season pros consistently brilliant season throughout every episode the finale couldnt have been any better the introduction of certain characters fitted in so well with the storyline episode are personal favourites better than season cons episode was the only one i didnt love but the rest were fantastic overall the mandalorian s catapults the star wars universe to new heights that i did not think it could reach almost every episode is perfect and it leads to a finale that i will never get tired of watching again and again s will certainly be very interesting in where it goes but this season of the mandalorian is easily some of the best tv this year if not the best what a show brave jon favreau and dave filoni quote alright pal its time to go mando rating
1,im actually a fan of luis guzmán in general but this is some of the worst miscasting in history gomez is supposed to be suave and this just simply doesnt work with luis playing him they cast morticia just as she should be unfortunately for me anything to do with the addams family will always be compared to the absolutely perfect movies from the nineties i have other issues with this show but this miscasting atrocity simply cant be forgiven my other big issue is an issue i tend to have with almost anything new these days too much effort is put into catering to the woke culture it has become absolutely exhausting
1,sorry to say this but it tastes awful creates a greasy film on top stains teeth and ceramic i think people who have it with milk dont realise as it gets mixed up if they had it straight they would see how bad it is my two cents
1,rec and was happy good price but we get want we pay for the scan dic would no por matt
1,this recipe was horrible i cannot understand how so many reviewers rated it so high i will definitely not be making this again
1,ive both exact a similar litre one from costco before which thick and smelt lovely similar to regular sized ones from the supermarkets so i dont think large quantity is the issue here this one from amazon is very runny as if its been diluted and doesnt smell or soften clothes same this may be fake im thinking really curious if bad batch or if amazon is not sourcing genuine product very baffled
1,this card only lasted two weeks before it began giving read errors i used it in a dash cam and no matter how many times i formatted it would only record for about a minute before failing again i picked up a pny card since and it has worked beautifully unfortunately ive been swamped and forgot to return this card before my days not happy about that
1,this skirt looks great on i didnt even think before buying it planning to wear it all summer so the aesthetic is great quality and design not so much you get exactly one good wear out of it before the folding absolutely disintegrates it is not sewn in or built to last then it looks like a cheap sarong over a cheap miniskirt i thought the dry cleaner might be able to fix it but they said they would have to resew the whole garment not exactly what you want to hear with almost bran
1,the sweater runs large the sweater is designed in such a way that it looks very sloppy i would never be able to wear it out of the house however the material is exceptionally soft and delightful keeping as its a great stay at home lounge sweater but way over priced for this purpose if you can get the fabric to lay correctly youre a genius
1,i was disappointed in this bread i wonder if the tablespoon of salt is correct i dont think i have ever added tablespoon of salt to anything i have made i thought this bread tasted too salty i didnt have canola oil so i used olive oil and sprayed the pans with pam not sure if those things had anything to do with the salty taste i will not be making this again
1,a serious joke i struggled with the buttons for a good minutes and gave up after the rd button im not sure what they were thinking

1,thank god for amazon return policy or i would be incensed this little platic device from hell died unexpectedly after days i lost all my phone pictures that were not stored on the phone i lost the music but have most on pc i lost the videos i had from concertswhat happened was the phone gave me a warning that the storage device sandisk ultra could not be found i took it out and restarted my galaxy note and it worked then about one hour later i got the same warning i tried to save my data with my backup pro app i had to purchase an extra gbs of data for cloud because the app comes with only mb or something like that and so i backed up everything on the sandisk storage and as it was backing everything on line using the backup pro cloud the sandisk fried and stopped the backup process i was prompted to format the storage disc but everytime i performed this process the phone would not complete the format now keep in mind that i was not near a computer because i was on vacation so i could not use a computer to format in fati am returning this disc and purchasing a samsung gb that costs over bucks you get what you pay for
1,i hated because battery is very bad last days i will charge but not full
1,i wore this bodysuit once it had a hole under the arm when i took it off
1,like many other reviews the item shuts itself off almost immediately each time after using only a few times
1,i so wanted to like this dress i ordered it for summer graduation and weddings i usually wear a s and even the xs is was too pig it drapes like a smock the material is heavy the only thing pretty about this dress is the pattern and color still looking for the perfect dress
1,i was so excited to get this dressi even paid expedited shipping i read the reviews and thought that i ordered properly but i sadly disappointed it was just too big im a size petite and the size was overwhelming the side of the dress were down to my stomach and i just cant wear the dress not sure what to do but buyers be careful pretty color and design but not welldesigned
1,this laptop is very bad plz dont trust on its ryzen processor freezing problems and slow processes
1,the material is horrible its heavy and cheap the skirt does not flow as it appears in the photo instead the bottom part of the skirt just stands out like ruffles am returning
1,worst experience with this laptop it doesnt turn on on battery within a month of usage i got to know this issue
1,so very disappointed with this recipe it was terrible i made this for a special occasion and it was like eating from the sugar bowl yuk i find it hard to believe this was a winning recipe
1,i had to review this because i purchased before any reviews were up and now that ive received this dress im appalled by all the positive reviews this dress is hideous in person seriously hideous and even if you can get past the drapery fabric its incredibly restricting the picture online is so misleading the dress isnt even an ivory its more of a pea green so disappointed
1,i am not going to get into it but season has left me hanging for the life of my i cannot follow the storyline from season it is confusing all the references to the names are presumed to be understood by the audience the continuity has been completely lost during season i am not even going to bother watching the second half the first two seasons were great they might have rushed into the storyline for season too soon the writing is horrible i still dont have any clue about the elvin culture and what purpose they have in this series i rated this which is based on the current season i dont see it getting any better after this season season is basically like the start of a new series i have no clue what is happening
1,the tights are thin and not how they appear in the photo one of my pairs had a hole in the seat and it was obvious they had been repackaged with part of the packaging missing very disappointing i wish i had found the hole before i try them on they are definitely going back
1,this product is not much good and not contain ms office and also not contain xbox battery is not good
1,this dress ran largemaybe because the pleats made this dress too roomy the dress hung on my right shoulder but the dress did not hold up at all on the left side of my body maybe because i have a short torsopetite frame i loved the yellow color for summerit would have made for a nice dress to wear for a wedding unfortunately i had to return it
1,execel is not open really i cant satisfied
1,how old was your dog
1,i bought it for my new galaxy note and i realized the device didnt recognize ittried it on other devices laptops desktop macbook didnt workvery disappointed
1,the color is completely off i loved the way this vest looks in the picture i was excited to have that vest but unfortunately what i received in the mail was a huge disappointment it came wrinkled and the brown is not as rich as it is in the picture very pale horrible
1,heat problem and battery discharge issue very cheap quality product total money waste
1,bad products display worst destop not open
1,i love the idea of this shirt but the execution is absolutely horrible i ordered online and what i received is just a mess the stitching at the bottom has big globs of black thread not just a few hanging off but literally big clumps a large portion of the stitching on the whole shirt looks like it should be on the underside of the shirt as the where the thread is tied off is on the outside the fit is just as big a mess i always have to buy a large in fitted shirts because i have very br
1,used in a chicken and mushroom pie filler thought it would add a nice flavour all it added was salt lots of it pie filler ruined and chucked in bin plus a layer of my tongue missing after tasting i like seasoning but this was over the top like when u accidentally swallow sea water
1,this is a rare review for me i usually love my retailer purchases even at times when other reviewers arent fans but this top is terrible b for reference small frame athletic bought the xs in black the length could have been longer but i could have lived with the length the arm hole area however a different story because its boxy and the fabric is stiffer bc of the large flowers the top sticks out on the sides under the arm holes leaving a gape it did not fit snuggly
1,this looks like the perfect easy sweater with the white shirt appeal to it but sadly the fit of this number is really off it looks more like a tent it must have been clipped in the back or something i cannot see any scenario in which this would look good
1,i love the idea of this top and ordered it in white it is a great design and proportion is nice with jeans the front is off white t shirt material with a pocket and the back is a light grey heathered panel i am returning it as it is very thin and the quality is cheap looking if the grade of material had been a bit thicker and better made then it would have been a winner
1,i have to say that i was really looking forward to andor ever since i first heard about it then when i saw the trailers i got even more excited i just finished watching it and it not only met my expectations but even surpassed them it actually might be the best star wars series so far or at least right there with the mandalorian the entire cast is great but diego luna is obviously the real star here he is just fantastic as the lead this may start a little slow but stick with it because it picks up in a hurry and the next thing you know youre completely hooked its already been renewed for a second season so i cant wait until next season and more of andor
1,bought this for galaxy s worked like a charm for months then i started getting error messages on phone stating the card has been taken out or that it is not there went on like this for a week or so then one day gone initially i thought it was problem with phone popped in a gb card from bb it worked popped this one into the bb same no detection after spending so much on an sd card its disappointing to see it go bust outside of return period
1,i am almost always an xs in bottoms sz but literally couldnt get the stretchy waistband no zip or fastening in xs up my hips in addition the brocade is a very lightweight polyestery tinselly weavedoes not suggest quality as others have noted it also runs short im and this was a little below knee length on me not anklelength ive had luck with retailers sale section in the past including some items that didnt always start off with the best reviews but have no regret
1,guys please do not buy this just that it will irritate you and frustrate you on a level where youll break it so please dont waste your money
1,if you want to watch this show solely because you are an addams family fan dont the eerie tingling dark gothic and death embracing atmosphere is not present here neither is the very soul of previous seriesmovies and the authenticity of their characters tim burton with netflix has simply borrowed this cult while completely raping defiling and butchering the very essence of its characters especially wednesday since she is the main one if you however like riverdale andor harry potter and hogwarts this show might be an enjoyable experience for you that is actually the only reason why i was able to finish this show you can think of it as a sort of mixture of these two shows the characters are unfortunately extremely off so dont expect that empty unemotional deadlike wednesday our new wednesday is constantly rude arrogant cringey mean and extremely pretentious she is in fact trying to be wednesday so muchwith all that pretentious and forced wannabe goth quotes that she has missed it and become something very distant from her instead of being empty like a walking dead corpse she is strongly angstdriven and always angry her selfassurance combined with arrogance and an i know everything and i know it much better than you passiveaggressive kind of vibe she can get on my nerves quite easily prepare yourself for over the top pseudo goth quotes coming in each episode such as i dont bury hatchets i sharpen them in every other dialogue this makes this show nearly unwatchable and i cannot believe that she is indeed the way she is trying to present herself the real wednesday would not have to prove herself what she is or hide her insecurities behind false superiority of her ego audacity and meanness the real wednesday has neither emotions nor vulnerabilitiesinsecurities but real confidence when she smiles its an empty gesture without a real emotion behind it the new wednesday is just a regular goth teenager with emotions and all the typical teenager stuff i wont elaborate further so that i wont spoil too much wednesday is constantly trying to prove herself that she is soooo different and soooo strong one independent girlboss who is so smart and superior that the others are just a burden dragging her down here we are arriving at perhaps the biggest butchery of the shows directornetflix the new wednesday is portrayed as an ultimate object of desire as opposed to the object of repulsion and disgrace of society this is precisely what made the addams family so funny and interesting to watch they were rejected because of their peculiarity and were frowned upon with fear and a certain protective distance that is however different in this show the new wednesday is the object of desire of everyone admired attractive and accepted from the first moment they have created a certain safe space of weirdos making humor very sterile and hyper politically correct no further repulsion from society is possible in this setting or even beyond their safe space this is however what made previous movies so funny the interaction between normal people and these weird sadistic monsters and the significant distance between these two parties apart from that severe plot holes are omnipresent and the plot is twodimensional at best many things are unfortunately poorly thought through reminding me of cartoons in my childhood for their predictability and imperfections the makeup artist has not even bothered to make wednesday look like a dead corpse after a couple of episodes leaving her tanned skin to look natural neither they did bother with shaving uncle festers eyebrow to give him his typical look the same goes for wednesday not to mention that they have picked a rather cute eyepleasing latina jenna ortega instead of some halfdeadlooking monster her parents are unconvincing and as off as her in all aspects the most convincing characters are probably thing and uncle fester this show is no more than just another soulless serial in the profitdriven machinery of netflix abusing a wellknown name of previous shows and movies for a quick boost in easily earned fame the only thing that is done properly here is the environment and the camera for this i cannot rate wednesday with anything above at best i did not expect much but you somehow made me feel disappointed
1,what a bunch of unlikable selfish characters really difficult to watch you keep watching waiting for something that never comes each chapter leaves you with a sour and uneasy feeling and this goes for both season one and season two i guess this was the intention of the series but it really doesnt work for me the initial murder mystery doesnt have weight through the season there is no mystery just dark soul people interacting with one another i regret reading all the good reviews that made me go for it a total waste of time aside acting and scenery are both good no complaints about that
1,my husband loves my meatloaf but im always on the lookout for new recipes and ways to make it mine rarely turns out the same two times in a row but he always loves itseeing that this had stars i decided to try it i made it exactly as the recipe was written yes it was moist but it was the most bland tasteless meatloaf i have ever made totally a waste of good ground beef sorry but i wont be making this recipe ever again
1,im still waiting for my cake to finish baking its all giggly in the middle and i need it in an hour and a half for my moms birthday i may be throwing it out and buying one what went wrong
1,stunning series based on a stunning book by margaret attwood written in i wasnt going to watch this as the propoganda around it was very leftist i couldnt stand to see some more virtue signalling rubbish from left wing socialist extremists to my surprise this story doesnt do that if anything it portrays the socialists as terrifying these are the architects of gillead the dystopic brutal puritanical society based along religious principles a distortion of christianity for allegorical purposes witness the selfrighteousness of the extreme environmentalists who would gladly destroy economies to generate a new world order if it would work to make people change their behavior these are the leaders of gillead and they are with us right now it is not trump you should be worried about it is the democrats the new puritanism we see today is not a product of liberal values but the product of socialist groupthink controlling our language and hence our thoughts in gilead one can only use certain words and much is blasphemous from there comes the policy creep of restricted dress options color coding strict behavior control for the greater good and peace and ultimately denial of womens freedom because their role is to bear children the return of the natural order the facsist mantra of communism the handmaids tale is astonishingly good at making you feel the prisoner in this ghastly world the horror of being without freedom is shown so well the inability to escape is shown so convincingly peoples inhumanity to each other is just a superficial scratch away it can appear overnight and we dont realise it bit by bit take away peoples liberties and you will create a gilead before anyone notices condone the puritanical suppression of women from religion of any kind and you will reap misery
1,binned it
1,i felt like this shirt cut me in the strangest way the waistband is very fitted but there is so much extra fabric above and below it that it poofs out like crazy and made me look like a had a droopy chest and wider hips its also see through fit is tts
1,the dress arrived wrinkled so i washed it and pressed it it looked beautiful until i sat down the entire dress was wrinkled and it looked terrible all day cant wear this again
1,i was really excited to get this dress i initially ordered a small i am a size but when i tried it on it was really tight the bodice at the top fit strangelyi had to shorten the straps quite a bit and the dress just looked off i love retailer and get all of my dresses from there and the look of the dress on line was beautiful but just didnt fit right i did love the lace look and would love seeing more dresses with this design
1,i thought it was only me and immediately assumed i needed to go on a diet when i attempted to put this adorable skirt on it got stuck at my hips im a very consistent size small in dresses and skirts i actually thought about putting it on over my head but that was impossible its going back now i see the other reviews and am relieved that its the skirt and not me wish i had read them before purchasing retailer is going to get a lot of returns on this one
1,very poor product overheat battery drain in hr sound voice crack charging issue
1,this does not appear to work with the samsung galaxy s it worked for a few weeks then my phone started giving me unexpected unmounted sd card error messages after a bit of searching people seem to agree that the s and sandisk micro sd cards do not work together
1,battery draining issue
1,waste of money laptop did not turn on
1,the writing of this show reminds me too much of chilling adventures of sabrina another netflix production with dark themes characters quibble about terrible things like torture and death and thats pretty much it the protagonists dont actually do anything borderline evil or bad making it all talk and no action its pretty cringey and the stakes are low moreover wednesdays visions are clear as day there is nothing vague at all no effort of deduction required her visions and her peers inputs point her directly to the next objectives which makes for poor writing case in point the revealing of the hydes identity also plot contrivances eg goodys powers in season s finale the only thing that rescues this show is the casts fantastic performance jenna ortega is perfect in her role and emma myers is a great counterbalance still the trope is getting repetitive towards the end the good news is that the production team has no overlap with sabrinas so theres still hope
1,money waste
1,after the purchase of days there is the problem cursor not showing and i also cannot find the solution of it
1,this is a series where the viewer put in the investment of watching but is rewarded with a low return on investment the ending is totally pointless and unsatisfying it appeared as if the writers all got tired couldnt figure out how to end it sojust picked up and went home would have been a lot better with an ending that actually made sensethis did not both seasons use the same template and sequencing of events the writer should look for something else to do that does not involve writing his stories and scripts are totally lacking in substance
1,never buy this product i have been using it for the last months and issues have already started its switching off automatically cant able to use and i dont know what to do
1,i bought this shirt to wear under a black skirt suit the fabric does have some stretch to it however if you have a normal to above boob size beware i have a d chest and the front of the shirt hit me to the point that i then looked preggers it was one of those situations which reminded me why i do not buy empire dresses in addition the fabric felt like something my grandmother would have used back in the s it was a thick polyester type material i think this shirt would still work f
1,worst product dont buy very slow processing and waste product
1,after binging all of it i can now safely say that this show is nowhere near masterclass first of all this series spend way to much time on things that doesnt matter on characters we dont care about the overall feeling i have after seeing the entire first season is that this is adapted very close to how the games work where we have geralt walking from one place to the other picking up side quests as he goes along now side quests are perfectly fine in games but they are called side quests for a reason and this tv show should be more focused on its core narrative it does however start to pick up by episode or thereabouts but by then i was really tired of watching things that didnt matter you could actually draw parallels from this show to the mandalorian they are sort of based on the same story narrative where the protagonist walks from one place to the next picking up jobs on the way but the entire tone is completely different as the mandalorian doesnt take itself too seriously and loves to play around a bit the witcher is the opposite so imo this fall the mandalorian was a big surprise and a series i find quite entertaining while the witcher disappoints the acting in the witcher isnt that good either i mean it really isnt the costumes arent that great either the entire show feels cheap in places it shouldnt feel cheap if you are going to make a dead serious show you better have the money behind it but the cinematography are at times spectacular with beautiful landscape shots with great color grading but when it comes to battle sequences they could be shot way better before this show came out the producers said this show would make got fighting scenes look dull thats not the case what so ever for everyone who saw battle of the bastards you know it would take some effort to make those scenes look dull it is of course possible to make something better but this show isnt one of those shows this show is as it stands right now rated way too high the show gets better with each episode but not much first season overall is not much more than a mediocre experience which should focus more on being a tv series rather than a computer game fair
1,i thought buying this directly from amazon would guarantee me an authentic sandisk honestly im not sure if i got an authentic one or not but its failed within months either its not authentic or sandisk has really dropped the ball on quality ps its made in china if that tells you anything
1,the worst laptop i have ever used the keypad is very small the down arrow key came out after just a month the keys are also very small compared to the normal laptops therefore you can not use it for longer durations as your shoulders would pain later battery back is not as mentioned the battery heats up to degrees i have made a video for this you can not keep it on your lap as it heats too much gb ram it hangs a lot it hangs even when i need to start it before putting the read more
1,i fell in love with this show and have binged seasons several times so i was excited for the much anticipated season it starts strong but there are so many storylines and characters that the essence of the witcher and geralts story arc gets very muddied it feels like it becomes about everyone elses story but his geralt feels like an aside and it is too the shows detriment very little witchering takes place at all by the end i felt like the writers had decided to take the show in a totally different direction which unfortunately no longer included geralt at its core it would be wonderful to see a return to the simplicity and grit offered in the first season more monster hunting and less elven politics henry cavill will be missed desperately but i understand why hes chosen to leave
1,the whole series makes me addicted to watch it the series is a masterpiece acting is on point id highly reccomend watching it

1,this ultra high speed card is about half the speed of the class card i was using mbs read and mbs write is more than a little below where a device with this rating should perform i could believe if it was the same speed as my old card maybe my brand new samsung galaxy tab doesnt have a uhs rated port but to be half the speed of my class card this uhs thing clearly is penciled on by marketing monkeys and sold without any testing or quality control i wish i knew how to rate with stars
1,i guess its a quite a good show for the ones who prefer their brain not to be involved while watching because there is nothing to proceed or think about from its first episode to the last moment it feels like a chewing gum with the same result by the end
1,like one of the previous reviewers when my jacket arrived it was not in the great dark wash pictured online it was in a basic medium denim wash i like the wash pictured online i did not like the wash the jacket came in additionally know that it is just huge i ordered my usual size medium and understood that the jacket was meant to be roomy and swingy but there is no way that one size down would be enough to compensate for how swimmingly large it was i never tried an xs but it was s

1,it appears that the gb sandisk ultra micro sd card i purchased from amazon was defective i installed it in my samsung tablet but could not successfully transfer files using either a usb cable or wifi the file transfer would appear to start but then would slow down and hang completely it did this on every one of multiple attempts with different file types and numbers of files ranging from many to just a single file i tried loading files onto the card directly from my pc but then the tablet would not see them i tried reformatting the card both in my pc and in the tablet but still got the same result after a few tries the tablet would appear to format the card but then tell me that the card was blankunformatted i did an aba with an old gb sandisk micro sd card that i had laying around it worked perfectly formating transferring files reading and writing files everthing worked i put the gb sandisk ultra card back in the tablet but had the same problems again i concluded that the sandisk ultra card was defective and returned it im still using the old gb card without a hiccupthe good thing was that amazons return policy was quick and painless
1,i ordered this top in a my usual size and it fits fine but it is way too shortwaisted it looks nothing like what the model is wearing her top comes low on her waist almost to her crotch area mine was just about inches below my belly button it was almost as if they accidentally cut off the lower half of the top at the factory very strange
1,i saw this dress in the catalog and immediately ran to the store to purchase then i realized the dress in the catalog is slightly different but the small differences is what makes the catalog dress so much more unique and worth the money look at the top the stripe colors are different and the stripes flow different on the skirt part as well and the dress was short on me and im two inches shorter than the model bummer

1,i saw the photo of the young woman wearing this dress in the reviews and she looked beautiful i on the other hand looked awful the fabric of the entire dress is quite stiff so the dress didnt move with me it sort of felt as if i was wearing a paper cut out then to contribute to the volume the sleeve is not set in it is a raglan style that on me looked more like a bat suit than what i was hoping for a beautiful distinctive dress for an important affair also the belt didnt enhance the

1,if you played the last of us you are in for some good time if you did not play the last of us you are in some very good time i am a big fan of games and harsh critic towards many movies and show based on a game and for once my mind is blown away might be for a very first time i will just leave it here and claim this as a tv masterpiece first episode was amazing and i cant wait to see the next episode there is a lot of action amazing drama acting and some horror elements since after all this is based on a horror survival playstation game pedro pascal acting is spot on and so is of miss ramsey
1,if your card gets hot enough to be painful it is defective and you need to contact sandiskfrom my experience the larger micro sds run hot on format and writing but not to the pain thresholdi purchased one of these cards to use in a camera and android tablet great read speed but write speed was okay used card for about two weeks and then all my files disappeared tried to format the card and three different computers with xp windows and linux couldnt format it the camera and tablet couldnt format it i rmad it and got another because sandisk is a good brand i did notice that when formatting or writing the card it got hot very hotsecond card didnt last hours and had the exact same symptoms as the first card write a file or format it resulted in the card getting hot enough to reach the pain threshold i called up sandisk and while explaining this was the second card id received with the exact same symptoms when i mentioned it getting hot they immediately issued me an rma they said they were told to issue an rma the moment they heard a card ran hotsmaller sandisk micro sds or regular sds i have or use dont do this i think sandisk has an issue with this cardthe last digits of the part number refer to the date code and origin of the card both cards had different date and origin codes

1,someday maybe in my lifetime hollywood will understand adult content is not for everyone i suggest the production team all sit down and watch valhalla rising and the watchmen movie and try to grasp grit you have one of the greatest stories ever written in front of you act like it
1,i bought this laptop months ago this laptop is causing a lot of problems it is restarting again and again it is not working properly this is a request to flipkart that you should give good products instead of giving discounts you people do give discounts but give bad products every person buys goods with his hard earned money and you people rob people like us
1,i am sorry to say this blouse is way below all retailer standards this top should have been placed on sale a long time ago poor quality in cut fabric design this is a top one would grab at a local box store for the colors are not as vibrant the shoulders ill fitted and the fabric and threads are very cheap i was expecting so much moresorry retailermy favorite store to shop
1,update from season up thru episode i failed to mention in my original post that my husbandman and i have been watching this series through the vidangel streaming channel otherwise we would have not watched it because of the liberal use of profanity the scenery continues to be outstanding as is the music the choice of cast members has been one of excellence each one of them continue to contribute more to the richness of the story line sheridan always ends each episode with the audience sitting on the edge of their seat as what comes next of all of the seasons so far this season is by far the best the one thing that i detest in any movie or tv series is predictability and yellowstone is anything but predictable i sure didnt see beths physical fight with the environmental woman to be conducted on the dutton ranchs front lawn wow now that was astonishing with jamies treacherous relationship with the employee of the development company wanting to aquire the dutton ranch the person who chose the actors for this show has original post below from season sheridan seems to like using the f word to express a characters emotion through out each season which is totally unnecessary to make a point and shows more about his character and definitely takes away the value of the richness of the series but then hollywood has always desired and sought to lead people astray from morality of this nation
1,super heavy seems some fraud the warranty is left with months bought few days back free ms office not therefraud they ask for money
1,display is faultygetting an yellow color on the top of the screen
1,i do not recall ever seeing beans used in tacos or lasagna
1,not good hopeless product i wasted my money display going off again and again and giving this message after off thousand rupees i spend money for this
1,ive been told to give this a rating by order of the peaky blinders
1,battery problem any time
1,bummed out this is super cheaply made and very expensive the design is different the color is beautiful but the material is a different story it should be priced at the most bucks not im returning them also they run very big
1,the keypad of the laptop is not working properlythe keys are auto typed sometime which is a very bad experience for mei recommend that you go to the store and check the laptop then buy it
1,completely divergent from the first two series they had constant twists and turns that kept us guessing in season you could almost predict everything that was going to happen from episode two too many clues given away from the outset the characters were all a little weak and unstructured the story lines around the actress and her two friends was just weird some of the plot lines were left unresolved the russians for example the actors mostly didnt seem to engage with their characters except mum and dad very disappointed if a fourth series comes along i certainly wont be watching it
1,i read all of these reviews and finally i found one that had the same issues i can not believe no one had issues i used pans the dough over flowed and created a huge mess the pans were greased floured and cooled and the cake stuck to the pans the cake was moist maybe to moist the cooking time was way off i cooked it for an hour and yes my ovens temp is correct the icinghad an after taste of flour and i still had grit from the sugar after doing patch work on the cake i salvaged it to a degree no i would not recommend this cake to anyone it was a disaster
1,the fabric is very nice on this wrap but it wears like a blanket
1,my family didnt like this i think the mustard counted against the flavor they asked me not to make it again
1,battery life only minute
1,i do not even know where to begin with this product i ordered a small i go between small and medium and felt that would be a good fit after trying on the shirt i would have opted for the xxxxxxxxs or whatever the smallest size is this shirt is very boxy i know its supposed to have a flow to it but this shirt is too much it needs to be taken in or have a belt wrapped around it i tried the belt look but it did not look flattering i found this color to be very blah overall i am slig
1,please not buy this laptop not working this heat issue and hanging and laptop fan not working please not buy
1,my idea of watching movies is the sound of music and marry poppins this i say as i refuse to watch horror movies and films which show violence the exception being historical accounts it took me several days to get through an episode of season as i couldnt stomach the the violence and horror at the end of season i was in such shock that i thought of writing to ask the producers of this show is it really necessary to show so much horror i i still have not answered this question however what is so potent about this series is that what we as viewers perceive to be an unthinkable dystopia is actually a reality for many women living in countries where they are not considered human or are in relationships of abuse every time we see this series we should think about the human trafficking that goes on in the world and try to do everything we can to ensure that this remains fiction and not fact
1,very bad product dont buy anyone
1,i found that this dress ran very small i am true ordered a and it was snug
1,the print on these leggings is so cool but they are completely seethrough i mean seriously seriously seethrough
1,this would be a great blouse for flat chested person i am a size and busty i ordered an xl and it was ridiculously tight across the chest and the fabric is see through you would need to wear a cami under it
1,i love baseball style tees and when i saw the homebase tee in two colors no less i was very thrilled especially since it was during the mothers day promotion on all items based on the models photos the top looks flattering with a swing type style i usually wear a medium and bought a small size in this top when the package was delivered i excitedly opened it and found two tees looking like maternity tops which would be lovely if i was pregnant the tops are so wide not like the webs
1,i didnt have a problem anticipating the fit of this dress i felt with the drawstrings on each side i could make it work i usually take a large and even ordered a medium as i had read all the reviews of it running big when i got the dress i was beyond disappointed it is a heavy itchy polyesterlike fabric not a thin rayon looking texture like the picture shows it is also a deep black not the plum color in photos but most importantly i am and the dress is very short on me it
1,product is good but service by the lsp was very very poor as i had to travel km for getting the product and they took extra on the name of damage in my old laptop whereas its already showing that small breaks and issues will not be considered when i hv already selected the avg condition of old product very disappointed
1,i ordered these because i loved the wide cut and overall look but returned them because they fit weird too tight around the too high waistline and normally i like a high waistline fit ran small and the overall quality of the fabric wasnt as nice as i was hoping for pretty disappointed
1,please dont buy and dont waste your money you can get better laptop at this price asus or better brand
1,i watched the first season after all the hype and the whole time i was not enjoying it at all i took a moment to process why i didnt like it and realized because it was full of unhappy discontented characters just brought me down there is no redeeming characters nothing that kept me motivated to continue to watch i didnt care about any of the characters maybe it gets better but the first season just didnt hold my interest in fact i wanted to turn it off because the characters turned me off for me the thought provoking storylines and dialogue was just a bunch of blah blah blah nothing too extraordinary the acting was good the locale was pretty thats about it to each their own i guess
1,cast is superb location is superb storylines are superb a damn good series
1,after one year the charger was not working system also very very slow looks like processor is very slow
1,i was so excited to get this top in the mail i loved the colors print cut everything i put it on and was so disappointed the top looks so much better on the model i dont know if i should have gone down a size i go between an xs and s but it looked terrible on me my husband took one look at me in it and said thats being returned still disappointed
1,did not like at all
1,everything is smooth but if you face any problems both flipkart and asus may deny to help you to fix that issue although it is under warranty it is better avoid this product issues i faced and did not get resolution as below laptop freezes very often only option is to hard power off wifi internet gets disconnected frequently and it impacts the wifi router as well i raised ticket with both flipkart and asus but both of them couldnt help waste of warranty better you go fo read more
1,the material is so thin and so itchylike other reviewers statedit itches so bad and feels like sandpaperi thought it would be ok to wear a tank top underneath but sleeves are still itchy otherwise the design is great and the long peplum hem is very pretty and would look great with skinny pants or leggings and boots
1,by far the best disney star wars production since rogue one unlike the awful obi wan kenobi book of boba fett and the decent but superficial mandalorian this show feels like star wars the tone writing casting with one or two exceptions and acting is excellent ignore the negative reviews by children teens or those with low iqs as this is star wars for adults my only two minor issues with the show so far is the casting of vel cinta poor actresses that are not convincing as rebels for some reason modern hollywood really struggles when casting strong female characters choosing women that dont physically look the part aside from these two characters the casting has been superb up until now i have not been a fan of disney star wars but if they can continue the high quality demonstrated so far with andor there is hope
1,episodes in and i simply cant wait for wednesdays to come around proper serious perhaps grown up star wars rogue one was one of the best cinema experiences ive had blending nostalgia with quality story telling for a lifelong fan that has aged this picks up the rogue one torch and keeps the rebellions plight relevant great choice of actors script great reprisal of characters i cannot fault this series so far in this way no tv series or film will sit perfect in every respect thats too much to expect this however gets very close for me please keep cassian and co on our screens
1,too much worst only days life failer mathor hoard
1,for all the work this recipe takes it is so not worth it i had to dump it all back into a big skillet and add spaghetti sauce and spices to give it flavor so i didnt have to eat the bland original definitely not worth it
1,poor quality material looks much thinner and cheaper than pictured
1,its not switching on after just months of use
1,sandisk has the name but in my experience the quality and speed is not there my lexar lasted longer and outperformed this chip
1,yikes quite a smell off of this one like wethot wool the color was beautiful but the sweater is enormous strange fit under the arms as well this one went back the same day
1,this was one of the worst recipe i have ever tried from your site it was a total mush bunch of green goop and i had to throw it out what a waste of my time it preparing it
1,yet to try the taste but why in this day and age start producing what was perfect in glass bottles suddenly in plastic
1,the catalog shot and model shot are completely different its like not even the same dress the neckline color the quality of lace
1,heavy really awful
1,battery drain with one hr is poor overall okay only battery is the problem i strongly recommend dont buying this laptop u lose your money
1,i got recommended this series by one of my customers a while back when it was all the hype it took me ages to actually give the first episode a go half an hour in i was hooked it is without a doubt one of the best series i have watched i am now reading the book elisabeth moss is absolutely amazing you feel all her pain and suffering i cant wait for series
1,i have been sent the g pop noodles instead of the advertised g pop noodle kings
1,i love your recipes but wasnt a crazy about this on
1,fits and lots nothing like picture very wide like a tent dress
1,the season is sheer class which grabs your attention the moment you start seeing it the good thing about peaky blinders is that it grows with time the directors have let it grow slowly and have been good at not over doing it it looks natural and you find it close to reality cillian murphy has been outclass in his performance as a lead actor hez cool classy and is well articulated for future this is his strongest performance in his entire career and ive started loving him for that folks watching narcos and other seasons on gangz will find this appealing in its own way a must see for folks interested in top quality british season
1,seems so long that ive been waiting for a plus imdb series to come on the likes of breaking bad the sopranos etc then this morning i see this with like a with over k ratings so had to check it out and boy im glad i did i didnt even know this had been made till this morning either havent played the game so cant base it off that can only base this off the first episode seems like a real good plot good length for a season opener at nearly an hour and a half which i liked great acting cant wait for the nd episode would definitely recommendif i had a playstation i would love to go and see the similarities everyone is talking of
1,i bought this on october th and didnt start using it for about a week after i received it on the th well two days ago it died a quick death i cant even format it so after all these years of buying sandisk products i guess i will give in and start paying a little more for kingston it seems as though sandisk is getting to be a cheaply built product you would think that a product this small and inexpensive would be able to be replaced without cost within the first days but that is my fault for not reading the fine print so lesson learned buy it right and buy it once so go with something else
1,this shirt appears nice in the pictures it appears to have a bit of style wrong the shirt is one of the thinnest fabrics ive ever purchased i live in warmer climate and its nice to have different cotton shirts with some style this shirt has no style and i thought it would i have purchased this brand before and thought this fabric would be similar the other shirts were way nicer softer and had a different level of construction i wanted to wear this shirt out and when i put it on it w
1,ive been buying from retailer for the last years and this is the first time ive ever posted a bad review first of all the fabric is scratchy thin and looks very cheap second of all there is no v back its more of a slight scoop and lastly im so i ordered the petite small and its still comes inches below my knee i am very disappointed in the quality and am definitely sending back the only thing i think this could possible good for is a swim coverup
1,laging and heating issue
1,not sure why but we just didnt like the flavor of this it does make a lot of gravy so i understand why mashed potatoes are the suggested side i added carrots and potatoes to the crock pot and the flavors just didnt work well together
1,after one month volume
1,when i tried it on it was a bit shapeless but it was on a promo so i decided to get it i kind off like shapeless ive worn it three times and washed it gently in the machine as recommended in a lingerie bag always and air dried it it now has a huge rip on the sleeve seam and i cannot see how this happened the inner lining is soft and substantial but the outer gauze layer is thin
1,like the previous review said i was excited to receive this top i had grand visions of all the ways i could wear it to my chagrin when i put it on it just fell right down and pooled around my waist i wish there were smaller sizes to order sadly this is going back
1,this is a cute dress but not for me i think it runs very small it is super textured so if you dont want to add bulk aka pounds to your frame this probably isnt for you its too bad its online only because i would have benefitted from trying this on first im sure its probably adorable on smaller thinner people unfortunately mine is going back
1,this is porduct not support to ms office and just like kids tap please dont buy and very bad experience west of money please dont buy brother and sister
1,laptop is not charging
1,i wanted this dress so much i ordered it twice both times the zipper was defectiveit would get stuck midway up at the waistlineso i had to send it back there isnt an retailer in my area this is a shame because its got great colors and looks flattering on and i was looking forward to pairing it with a cardiganboots for fall i even thought about taking it to a seamstress to have the zipper replaced but the cost didnt seem worth it too bad as it seems like it would be a nice
1,this is really a great serie it make me feel like the first time i watched the first movies of starwars its times better than starwars movies and that were so bad
1,worst laptop ever black display not working under warranty worst
1,looks great in the picture but when i got this in the mail the fabric was so stiff shaking it out did nothingalmost like it was dipped in drying glue i got this for which is so cheap and i still returned it
1,love the design of the fabric i actually bought these in both colors i gave only star due stitching on the fabric its very scratchy
1,a truly unwearable slip scratchy fabric bunchy skirt teeny bodice it feels like you are wearing wrapping paperthe foil kind
1,sound quality poor audio vibrate
1,way to much cheese to little eggs only out people finished it
1,very very proud poor
1,i bought the black and gray fleece lined leggings i thought the price was great too good to be true you get what you pay for once i opened the box they smelled awful it was a chemical smell i washed the black pair twice and it was a little better i have washed the gray times and it still smells
1,quality was not what you expect from retailer especially for the price top is lined but skirt is not material is tissue paper thin and see thru there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat it keeps popping up however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives was returned
1,heating problem battery backup not good many times suddenly off
1,i bought these on sale and they quickly went back i was very disappointed after reading the reviews i thought for sure these would be a winner however i was sadly mistaken i ordered another pair of jeans the same from a different brand these were way too small while my others were too large they didnt live up to my expectation and were still rather long even though i bought these on sale i was not happy with the quality
1,for the record i did watch the original tv series and the movies with christina ricci so i do get the complaints about this not being exactly what purists were expecting it is easy to compare to harry potter but then any show that takes place in a mystical school setting for the next decade is going to be compared to harry potter so unless you want all shows of this type to not be set in schools then it is something we all have to live with what i liked about this is what alot of addams family purists didnt this was strictly a story about wednesday addams and not about her family who all just appeared in cameos this is in large part a coming of age for wednesday who neither fits in in the outcast boarding school she goes to or the normie town that surrounds it but finds herself making friends in both despite her best intentions while trying to solve the mystery of who is killing people around town to anyone who says this isnt the addams family i say so what each showrunner has the right to show their own interpretation of what came before and if everyone wrote the same exact story it would get boring after awhile
1,i wasted my mon
1,battery life is very worst
1,check video very bad to perform excel light on off screen
1,i purchased this top on sale and was really excited about the style it fit great the first time i wore it i washed it once according to the care instructions after washing it in cold water and allowing it to air dry it was basically ruined it shrunk up in length widened out about two inches im pretty bummed about it because it was cute
1,within an hour of using the memory card it failed and died it kept saying memory errori could never get my dashcam camera to record anything i went to our walmart and got me just microsd not ultra it has been working all day so farthats right there is no way to tell what you are getting online is oem or knock offs when the price is too good to be true it probably is made and distributed by mofia lolalthough the package arrived on time i will never buy this product online or from this seller on amazon waste of money
1,good but its battery life is too poor you cant use this laptop for more than hours in spite of the full charge
1,this dress hangs horribly unlike the photo the waist does not cinch too bad the colors are great and the quality of the material is nice because i bought it on sale i may try to tailor it to work but unless you are willing to do that its a no go
1,emi not processed in time also customer support is poor nil resolution product is average with low build quality dont purchase please
1,this was just ok the sauce was watery from the frozen raviolis and they were doughy my husband who loves lasagna couldnt eat this i reheated the next day and the sauce was less watery and the taste was slightly improved but i will not be making this again
1,the meat stayed very soft the oats were completely the wrong starch to add and the sauce was sickeningly sweet it couldnt even be salvaged by being made into a sandwich i cant believe so many people liked this gross just plain gross
1,washing liquid had leaked in the box
1,ive only had this memory card for weeks and it not only has recently started resetting it intermittently loses contact with my cell phone and the memory is lost erasing everything on it now i find out my return date has past and im stuck with a peice of s memory card that i cant do a damn thing about thanks a lot for nothing i will never buy direct from here againalso i didnt realize i was supposed to have an adapter too wow where the heck is that at
1,ive used simple products before as i have sensitive skin and am allergic to certain products however using this product ive come out in a rash on my face which hasnt gone all day
1,i got this for my brand new nokia lumia but there is some kind of problem the card is horribly slow i cant record hd video to it it studders ive tried reformatting several times to no avail i didnt have any of these problems with my old gb class sandisk card there are other people having this problem as well seems hit or miss i cant recommend this card at this time for this reasonedit ive contacted sandisk and they are rmaing the card ill improve the rating if the new card corrects the problemedit got the new card problem still existsedit ive suffered with this card for a year now the only problem is that i cannot take video without studders so i figured maybe software updates would eventually fix the problem they have not i have used multiple different camera apps and the problem still persists
1,useless
1,heating problem waste product dont buy
1,i have no idea how well it tans as yet i am writing this at am i put it on after my shower yesterday evening and the stink has woken me up and given me an absolutely horrific headache desperate to wash it off but im afraid of disturbing the kids cheers dove
1,i tried this dress on in store i loved it online but in personnot so much it looked and felt like a cheap halloween costume the fabric was bad really bad the mustard color was beautiful boo
1,i was so eager to try this reciped for a friend who loves pumpkin spiced cupcakes i made this recipe to the t using all of the same ingredients following the instructions exactly and making sure to bake them at the right temperature and everything i dont understand but my cupcakes are coming out songeymushy and not rising at all i dont think its the baking powder because i just bought a new one the other day if anyone knows why this is happening id really appreciate it if you could let me know really sad the batter and frosting will all have to go to waste
1,not pree instead windows
1,this top runs super small in the upper arms shoulder areacould not even stretch out my arms other then that major problem the length and body fit were perfecti am true med andor large in all retailer tops so i tried sizes and neither worked for me due to armshoulder fitdisappointed because it really is a beautiful top
1,unfortunately the otter is broken after one month matching days after the return period expired for the money it is more than disappointing
1,too much lagging and heating
1,graphic card doesnt hold laptop hangs within days this is how the laptop has been performing
1,acting of all the casted stars is just phenomenal with an amazing storyline
1,twl had something of a contemporary agatha christie a sort of modern ten little indians tales feel twice successfully refreshed by a change of cast and location season was somehow conventional and mass but somehow contained enough satyre and subtlety to build up something interesting and hook the viewers season was imo the best offering a refined version a wellbrought intrigue great characters and a beautiful scenery season is just a different show and has nothing of what made season and so remarkable the humor is flat the intrigue unfolds sp slowly and unsurprisingly its painful most characters and stories are dull and unnecessary i feel bad for the cast that includes some great actors and they do play well but the material they were provided with is so subpar they wont succeed in creating any momentum plots are so loose no matter what will happen in the next coming episodes it wont buy me back as watching the first half of the season required too much effort of trusting the writers to surprise me and show something better the next week and the next week and the next week in vain the white lotus season has absolutely nothing to tell no mystery to unfold it certainly doesnt take the viewers on the trip
1,laptop not turning on after month of usage not good
1,the screen is not working
1,this is fantastic everyone loved it and yes i will definitely make this again
1,everything is ok but battery is very poor because i use only for browsing but battery drain so fast it gives only hrs
1,sadly i missed the return window by a couple of days this card got flaky in my galaxy note a little google research and it appears this is a very well known and widespread issue with these class gb cards avoid until its fixed
1,reading the previous complaints i can only concur with walmart membership service in general its obvious that customer service representatives are located overseas and speak broken english for starters why they are trained for niceties in the hopes to quell the poor services it serves no purpose if the simple question why my promised delivery twice in one week did not appear insult to injury i contacted the local walmart where the delivery was coming from miles away the operator told me there was no store manager that i can speak to and referred to the online customer service representative
1,performance and battery is worst plz dont buy it
1,i stalked this sold out product for weeks hoping my size would become available when it did i was very excited in fact i ordered both a s and xs to be sure one sweater would fit me unfortunately neither did and i felt the actual sweater was not as pictured the sweater has an overall baggy fit and the cutouts dont fall as neatly and as evenly on both shoulders as the picture shows making the look a bit sloppy in my opinion it is such a shame as this look is very of the moment and the mod
1,i ran several tests both on my computer and my phone it wrote at mb and read at about to depeneding on its mood i bought this to replace a generic gb class card that i lost so dang small i droped it and could not find it that card actual wrote at to mb and read at mb i went with sandisk because my phone came with a class that performs more like a class what a waste of time refunded this item
1,flipkart send me used and defective product product has different serial number and invoice has different one this laptop is slow and battery issue waste of money i do complaint but flipkart are not escalated issue giving unnecessary and non professionals reasons waste of time and money
1,product already bought twice both times broken after only a short time songs are played only briefly
1,this vest looked so cute online but its a disaster the quilting is so bulky that the drawstring doesnt work properly and it just hangs itlooks like something out of a costume closet that could be used for a peasant farmhand or a zombie movie seriously its bad
1,dont purchase laptop from flipkart they just dont care whatever happens later i bought this laptop for friend he received it with no battery processor ram and rom when we placed replacement the delivery company needs working laptop from us after so much of struggle they have rejected replacement of the product now my friend roaming around consumer court for justice im a regular flipkart customer suggest u dont purchase laptop from flipkart he has taken video while unboxing
1,this is the most unflattering peplum top i have ever tried on fit perfectly as a size should in the arms shoulder chest then the waist was huge just hung off of me like a flour sack it was wider than the chest measurements which made me appear frumpy instead of tailored and classic combine that with the highlow hemline and it looked like a project runway reject sent back immediately do not buy this if you have or want to appear to have an hourglass figure it will do nothing for
1,i wouldnt buy this again frequently it leaves slime on the clothes particularly at lower temperature washes the manufacturer knows this and the package advises you to simply rinse under warm water if this occurs when taking an kg load out of the machine its not easy to spot this i usually dont find it until putting the garment on by which time its dry and encrusted
1,if we do not plug in the system will not on no battery backup not even hours take care of these before placing the product on flipkart
1,dont buy this product its performance is very low
1,bought this with my samsung galaxy s when it first came onto market and it worked for about a week then quit all of the pictures i had taken originally and stored on this card are just gone it was a bad purchase and after looking through numerous forums hundreds or thousands of people were having the same issues with this card and the galaxy s i do not recommend buying this card if youll be putting it in a galaxy id like to tell sandisk where they can put it
1,this series has not disappointed cillian murphy ias a genius ascot i first saw him in the batman series and thought he would be a minor player then i found some of his earlier work especially the wind that shakes the barley and was totally taken in he can change his voice as well as kate winslett and can be evil or good depending on the need i thoroughly enjoy him and in this role he is masterful the evil part he played in the dark knight trilogy almost had him pegged as the evil dr type of character but oppemheimer brought him to the attention of everyone as a wonderful character actor i cannot recommend this series highly enough
1,i cant believe am the only one who feels this way and thinks thisnarration is anticinemait adds nothing to plot nothing to story nothing to the actingis basically an ugly distraction why include something that will not add anything to your storyi have never understand this whole concept of narrationi hate it will all my soul moving past the glaring mistake of narrationthis is basically a teenage showand againevery good writer knows that it is almost impossible to carry any meaningful agenda or idea with teenagers as your vehiclesit just doesnt work its not interesting engaging or grasping in any wayteenagers are unpredictable and immaturewhich means their decisionmaking is compromisedwhich means your plot is compromisedyou need consistency from plot this show reminds me of yellowstoneeverything is sooo in your facethe acting the music the soundtracksuughhyou can tell a story without shoving every aspect of it in the audiences facejesus just another empty pointless show
1,defective product

1,received damaged
1,given the great reviews and high rating i had great hopes for this recipe followed it exactly and cannot figure out what all the hype is about very pedestrian no one liked it and all agreed it was missing a lot of something the chicken was very bland even though i used a very good parmesan that i grated specifically for this recipe and added some salt i season everything to the flour the bruschetta on top was just garlicky tomatoes definitely deleting this one from the recipes to try file
1,guys if you are someone who has to prioritise battery then pls dont buy it its a waste of money and speakers isnt good too
1,these are way oversized i have several pairs of pilcro jeans and these run way too large wasted money on shipping wont do that again
1,i agree with the other reviewers this top is completely disappointing in every way i could not believe it was the same top i pulled from the bag where to begin it runs really big its short and boxy not at all like it appears on the model this must be pinned a lot in this picture colors are completely dull in person i really think this picture was lightened a great deal fabric feels cheap and stiff lining is stuff and poorly sewn i havent one positive thing to say about t

1,i ordered this top online during the mothers day sale thinking i had found the perfect white staple tank i wanted for summer i had this top on for barely five seconds before i knew it was going straight back the quality of the fabric and the overall design are both very good but the problem is that the top comes with an underlayer up top this is normally a good thing extra coverage in a sumer top generally means you ca go braless the problem is that the top layer of the shirt is so shee

1,where o where did the old pilcro ankle stet go these are a cheap impersonator the denim used to be thick which really did wonders for the fit and overall appearance of how the denim lays over your lower half the last pairs of pilcro stets ive ordered have gone right back because they are nowhere close to the greatness they were originally the pockets on these jeans sit so so low completely unflattering the ankles are significantly smaller circumferentially the old stet ankle jeans ha
1,poor laptop keyboard quality is very bad lagging every time low refresh rate dont waste your money
1,very poor display dont buy this product
1,comments the detail is lovely especially the dragonflies on the sleeve and the quality is there with the lining trouble is this is thick fabric cut in a box shape imo you have to be very skinny to pull this off and not look like a tank i looked at the model after purchasing and notice that she has it open and swept back a bit bc if it is not it is terribly unflattering
1,can not pass activation screen as wifi not working also built is very bad dont buy this laptop all reviews are wrong no support from flipkart brand contact details provided by flipkart is wrong
1,flipcart gives defectiveproduct is cheap product is not working properly as they show on cover page it has backlight no backlight performance was bad
1,the tank looks nothing like the one pictured mainly because its tissuepaper thin also i ordered it in two sizes xs and s as it can be hard to tell which one will fit i started with the xs and quickly discovered that it ran large the armholes hit halfway to my waist obviously i didnt even bother opening the size s both will be returned
1,please dont buy this productt this laptop doesnt deserve even k
1,season was a chilling thoughtful depiction of a society that descends into a misogynistic authoritarianism creepily showing the scariness of how easy for so many to accept the persecution of women as a way to power but then season and on the series became more a conventional look what happens next with plot twists for the sake of surprise plot twists and audience pleasing revenge scenarios with some graphic violence thrown in to make it all really serious entertaining enough but compare to a truly great series like game of thrones season in handmaids events happen to move the plot forward and have the characters react so june miraculously stumbles on her mother allowing her to leave her kid to get back to the thriller action sequences in game of thrones events happen because of the characters flaws and psychology which evolves and further creates events that with hindsight are inevitable handmaids is very entertaining but after season not great
1,having loved season one and liked season two i was really looking forward to three well what a disappointment this has proved to be i cant find a single character with redeeming features and its all so slow normally i would give it at least three episodes but i lost the will to live by the end of episode two there is just nothing happening im also not that keen on any of the actors even surprisingly jason isaacs who i normally quite like i also have an ongoing puzzlement with hollywoods fascination with aimee lou wood who i find very mediocre i see that season is already lined up but id need some real persuasion to waste some time on it
1,plastic body body was a very bad
1,battery issue hour battery if you use continuously to be honest go for the product have high battery otherwise this machine willl not be consider as portable you will find charging board everywhere you go
1,my impression as polish person watching american vision of the witchesepitome of polishslavic fantasy generally good so far forced diversity is bit painful but im trying to not be butthurt about it unfortunately original sarcastic humor that made books so appealing was not well translated into movie reality but i didnt expect this some word games and culturalhistoric references are not possible to broadcast henry cavil is doing really well portraying geral he is awesome with sword definitely eye candy and he is doing brooding really well in my line of work we call it seen it touched it all got a tshirt type and thats exactly how witcher suppose to be he saw some shit and he is still alive jaskier is a perfect cast and they have proper bromance with geralt singing is painfully modern but we need a comic relief and he is so good in this as the book version is yennefer actress is good acting is good visuals she suppose to be pale as a winter itself but we have beautiful indian olive skin if actress performance was poor it it would be a problem but she is doing good job so visuals fade in background tris merigold just no how can you miscast so much one of main and favorite character and geralt second best love interest visuals complete fail she suppose to be is looking cheeky red head stereotypical irish we have middle age hispanic character life smart boyish softie and we got soccer mom in series just no and one star minus for this other characters doing well cast wise and although some of them change race from white to black or age from old as trees to sexy is they are generally well cast monsters very good cgi except the dragons swordsmanship and battle scenes absolutely glorious gore and as realistic as ed doctor can dream of yes injuries were very accurate my recommendation worth to watch and i will be following the series i just have a little heart ache that something so fundamentally polish was not strong enough to resist cutpaste match for all american culture ps did i mention boobies and sex and hairy chest of geralt
1,as the u s a descends to fascism in real life andor paints a stark picture of life under authoritarian rule the lengths fascists will go to hold their grip on power and the sacrifices brave people must make to fight back and it bears a message that hope that can spring forth from even the smallest acts of resistance its a show that reflects all the fear and frustration were living through all the anger at a system built on lie after lie all the manipulations and corruption that perpetuate the fascist state and the bravery of those who risk everything just to say no its not flawless by any means and in a different time and place it wouldnt earn a but in the here and now of america in andor is the perfect show with the perfect message
1,my wifes razr m has been a great phone to date i matched it with what i thought would be a great memory card having been a long time sandisk ultra user in my photographysadly after months without warning the card mysteriously bricked unreadable by her phone two pcs and one mac the only thing that can even see the card is my droid bionic which says the card is unreadable and needs to be formatted i am hesitant in the very odd chance i can still recover the many gigs of photos and videos of our month old baby which were not backed upi could not be any more disappointed in this product
1,gave me and everyone i gave a pack to a rash and spots
1,so this may be my least favorite thing i have ever bought from retailer this top had so much extra material it was like wearing a bag or parachute it looked a million times cuter in the photos
1,this laptop is very poor flipkart customer service is very poor
1,sound speakers are tooo low even cant ear must need earbuds
1,not good repeatedly self ejects from new galaxy s returned for exchange or refundbought two one works well but one doesnt i guess is defectivei have two gal sis why i bought
1,when andor was announced it was probably the least exciting of the various series on the cards as soon as the trailer dropped however that changed completely and the show itself doesnt just live up to the trailer it surpasses it andor is a slowburn but boy does it burn it has some of the most incredible writing dialogue and acting of the entire franchise taking star wars beyond mere entertainment and making it art rogue one surprised us and it become one of the best star wars movies ever made this tale showing the bourgeoning rebellion and andors reluctant enticement into it delivers on the promise made by rogue one that star wars didnt just have to be about jedi and sith or the skywalker family to be engaging and meaningful expect drama intrigue suspense and some incredible schadenfreude by episode these are complex characters and this is a complex world where both sides of the fight linger in a realm of grey at one point were told this is what a reckoning looks like well for the show as a whole this is what good storytelling looks like and i cant wait for more
1,this shirt has absolutely no shape look carefully at the model and you we discover she is cleverly positioned to hide the sheer boxyness of this shirt the print is beautiful but it looks like a maternity shirt i even ordered the xs at and lbs but found it too baggy returned
1,i wanted to like this the cast is great the idea seemed great the problem is that there isnt a single person i like the children are so horrible that i cant sit through watching another minute of it
1,these socks were very thin and the elastic at the top was very rigid i could not get these socks to go any higher than halfway up my calf i would not recommend this product it felt very cheap and not of good quality
1,video quality not good
1,dont buy this product battery backup is worst only hour of video streaming and hr for gaming and heavy usage
1,a slowburn of a show a bit too slow for my taste while the storylines without cassian andor are really interesting the cassian andor parts are the weakest parts of the dhow so far my biggest complain tho is in the whole show is one alien that says one sentence the rest is humans and the locations are all pretty with one previously known exception i dont watch a scififantasy show to see humans with realworld weapons camp in ireland disney again doesnt use what star wars has be really good in during george lucass times present an interesting and fascinating universe with strange unearthern environments and intelligent species so far the weakest of the start of the rebellion shows disney put out
1,among all the welldrawn characters and storylines in the white lotus season two arcs stood out to me as astonishingly profound quinns transformation and tanyas emotional collapse quinn the teenage son who begins the show glued to his screen and detached from life finds something real and grounding by the end his choice to sleep on the beach alone under the stars isnt dramaticits spiritually honest that image says more about purpose and freedom than any monologue could its pure cinematic storytelling no exposition just a moment that breathes as someone who studied directing in film school i found this moment to be one of the bestdirected sequences ive seen on television it captures a characters internal shift using only atmosphere silence and framing thats not easy on the other side is tanya played flawlessly by jennifer coolidge the scene where she scatters her mothers ashes hit me hard its absurd sad beautiful and offkilter all at once her grief isnt clean or nobleits erratic and selfinvolved but completely human coolidge embodies the role with a mix of instability and vulnerability that makes tanya unforgettable her journey doesnt end in closure but in more confusion more lonelinesswhich is exactly what made it so affecting while other charactersrachel shane nicole and paulahad compelling arcs they didnt reach me on the same level their stories were wellacted and wellwritten but it was quinns quiet awakening and tanyas messy mourning that left the deepest marks the white lotus doesnt rely on big twists or moral lessons it relies on craft mike white through these characters and moments demonstrates what directing really is knowing when to say nothing and when to let the image speak everything
1,love this top its pretty unique and well made i did size down to a small for reference and still have a slightly oversized look
1,very very bad flipkart and flipkart product
1,i had heard such positive praise for white lotus that i decided to watch it my first impression why is this considered a comedy drama i didnt find one thing funny in either season one or two the humor is allegedly dark however its must be so dark that im watching the show with the lights off and simply cant see it it is certainly a drama more of a high end soap opera with a few twists after watching both seasons i cannot say this is one of the best shows ive seen in a while it is ok yet given the hype and less than satisfying reaction ive had to it i graded lower than average i also dont like soap operas i havent watched once since i stopped watching dallas at the end of season white locust is like seeing an ad for a great steak dinner at a new place however when you finally get the finish product on your plate it isnt as tasty or appealing as advertised no doubt about it season will be green lit because of the still overwhelming praise being rained upon it maybe it will get better
1,getting issues just after days switching off automatically after blinking power led in orange and beeping for few seconds no service center details are available created a ticket in flipkart lets see
1,i was excited to see these jeans since they came in petite sizes and had a short inseam unfortunately after orderingreturning several pairs i found out that these are actually not petite jeans please beware that if you are ordering these for the shorter inseam they are actually in not in as in the description other than the inseam issues they fit like typical paige denim
1,the st season started off as a show a fella could enjoy with his misses but season the drama really started grabbing hold and by season its a soap opera with cowboy hats and it really stinks because they dont make any shows men can enjoy anymore god forbid apparently our money isnt green every season is basically the same something horrible happens to kayces wife to which they must sit and talk about the whole season seriously just skip anything with her it never has any bearing on anything beth mean to jaime and they fight over and over again beth does something crazy to random person rip must tame her ad infinitum beth has talks with dad about how shell do anything for him outside financial forces they have to go to war with to save the ranch something happens to the cattle the funnest part of the show is really the collection of ranch hands and they all but disappear for season but all and all it is done well i just feel like its held in high esteem mainly because the field is so weak it competes against solid
1,the cut of this piece is great the quality of the fabric is terrible i used it under another layer the first day i wore it and it pilled across the bust after hand washing in cold water and hanging to dry it shrank in length so much that i can no longer even wear it i always happily pay a premium for quality staple wardrobe pieces this didnt hold up to one wearing let alone one season i recommend strongly against it
1,ive really tried to like the white lotus but its really hard and getting harder with each season what they all have in common is extremely unlikeable characters without a single exception and an unbelievably slow pace the show runner seemingly mistakes extreme decadence for humor ok there was some dark humor in the first two series but in series three there is none and no thrills either just severe overacting especially by parker posey and the most annoying and overly loud overly dramatic soundtrack i have ever heard in all my life if this is typical thai music i feel sorry for the thai people wouldnt go there if someone paid me
1,the fabric of this vest is identical to a old white dish cloth the cut of this vest is also bad will be sent back
1,everything is perfectexcept the keypad some are not functioning wellits too bad
1,very bad experience do not try the batter was so lumpy even though i used everything stated above with exact quantity then when i baked it it didnt even rise properly and tasted gross ive been making hot milk cake with a different recipe but i wanted to try a new recipe and now regretting my decision
1,battery drainage heating to much not able to work because hang the system and everytime going to sleep because of heating
1,looked really cute on line arrived with a large hole in the front quality and look was very cheap would not recommend this sweater at all step it up please retailer
1,my conscience screamed at me not to buy this sweater and i wish i had listened i noted the fact that it was acrylic and also the fact that it was oversized but i also loved the design and cant resist anything with mustard yellow i was instantly disappointed when i received it almost didnt even try it on how can they possibly charge for terrible itchy s acrylic it looks cheap it feels cheap and it didnt even fit well only redeeming quality easily returnable
1,followed the directions but the bars came out dry on the edges and raw in the middle the frosting came out really runny i even added more powdered sugar and it didnt help after reading the other reviews i might try it again but cut the whole recipe in so if it doesnt work out i wont be throwing away as much food and money i did this time ill probably lower the temp to and let it bake a few more minutes
1,not impressed not very moist or flavorful
1,this is not a comedy its not funny and this is definitely not a feel good series after watching all six long episodes i only laughed out loud twice what this is is a very slow drama and character study about some unhealthy dynamics between people set to the backdrop of some very loud music it took three full episodes to lay the groundwork before anything really started to happen the main problem with this series is its blandness it lacks the cliffhangers and over the top suspense of a soap opera instead the plot is based on pretentious stereotypes about rich white people behaving badly toward each other and the hotel staff that being the core of the series leads to some very shallow storytelling and a rehash of tired themes under the guise of being woke the acting is good the characters are believable as portrayed again albeit shallow the background music is far too pervasive and loud wasnt there a sound engineer to help it literally becomes annoying and part of the foreground rather than background disregard the first three episodes and save yourself a lot of boredom the final three arent much better but at least there is some action
1,the script was just abysmal making mediocre performances even more mediocre wednesdays character had promise but poor execution i know its hard to act bad characters and the writing left so much to be desired but the performances felt like theyd be more comfortable on nickelodeon than a series designed to be dark and uncomfortable it was unclear where wednesdays line of creepiness was and the idea of the men following her round with their tongues lolling out was reminiscent of a fanfiction written circa uninspired and unbelievable premise of never more also confusing regarding whether it was meant to be a known or unknown secret had to stop watching i couldnt bear the cringe
1,being an addams family fan ever since the first tv series i had to see what this latest attempt has done with the addams daughter wednesday so happy i did this interpretation of her is going to stick in my mind for a long time played so masterfully by jenna jenna will always be wednesday to me just as johnny depp is edward scissorhands yes there are themes reminiscent of harry potter but the same can be said of quite a few films and series ever since so what we still seem to be enjoying them loved the mystery the fastpaced action the fantasy excellent acting by all plus pretty good special effects not for young children but highly recommended for everyone else
1,dont buy online i have faced many problems
1,writing review after month of use screen started shaking in every minutes of use buy on your own risk
1,if you like thorough character development in your stories and very little else then this is the show for you watch rich people argue about rich people problems in front of a rich italian backdrop for sevenpointnine straight episodes then dont blink because the entirety of the plot and revolution happens in the last thirty seconds of the last episode you could literally just watch the last episode and know what the entire show was about because its so damn repetitive i only gave this show a watch because of all the buzz but i wish i had the hours back aubrey plaza is great as always but not worth watching this show for
1,i am using this laptop for almost years i had purchased it on june and today is july my laptop is not responding it automatically forced stop and no not turning on battery was more then but still its not working and even not showing charging light hen current is flowing in the circuiy
1,worst laptop dont buy worst display too much of heat and noise poor build quality worst performance
1,it uses trial version of ms office display quality is not up to the mark
1,battery backup only hours to hours
1,i am not sure who would look good in this dress it is extremely oversized with tons of fabric that will not flatter anyone
1,i really want to like these and i do trust sandisk more than other manufacturers of memory cards that said im moving on to my rd card thank you amazon for having exceptional customer service or else id be very upsetbasically this card will suddenly not allow writing to it anymore you cant save files to it you cant delete files from it and you cant event format it ive tried doing all three in different oses and devices with no luck doing some reading on the sandisk forums this seems to be happening a lot with these cardsim returning this to amazon and trying my luck with a different brand to see what happens
1,i made this and followed the instructions as directed but the rice did not cook all the way i had to throw it all away perhaps switching to instant rice would solve e this problem
1,do not buy this model this model of laptop has manufacturing defect it has charging and overheating problem i suffered a lot due to this faulty product finally flipkart agreed to refund i request everyone do not purchase this
1,it was a defective product nd performance is too slow
1,im and ordered the small as soon as i saw it in person i knew it was an item to return the material is too transparent and designed to wear with undergarments or swim gear that you want people to see it was way too long for me i think it would work for a taller person i just didnt feel it was worth the money for the quality and transparency
1,charger heat within min of charging battery performance is so bad
1,very underwhelmed with all the fabulous reviews i was hoping for so much more followed recipe exactly but didnt have hot saucemightve helped a little but i doubt enough to make me want to make again
1,i thought from the picture this would be a light floaty top when it arrived the fabric was a heavy knit and the neckline sagged very low on me granted im a pear the bottom layer hugged my tummy and rear in a very unflattering way the only thing i liked was the color back it went
1,this top really is lovely i had high hopes of it looking smashing with black jeans i wash everything before i wear it though this garment says it needs to be dry cleaned there was nothing so delicate about the fabric that it had to be dry cleaned so i hand washed it with delicate soap when the lighter colors came into contact with the black the black immediately stained the light color i tried putting some stain remover on the black stains rinsed and hung it above my bath tub it is cur
1,has acting actually sunk this low its so bad it diguises how bad the script is i watched episode one all the way through for the train wreck effect i wont be back
1,followed the recipe to a t and it turned out shall we say not so good it looked nothing like the photo which should have been my first clue when i saw what looked like an omelet under the chicken usually you do egg then flour so i dont know if this was the problem or if it was suppose to be like this too much basil and garlic for c of bread crumbs wont be trying this one anymore
1,after doing some tests between a generic memory card and this sandisk i am very disappointed i bought the gig class cardi swore i picked original packaging but it was shipped with out original packaging i will be returning this card for the following reasonsthese tests were done using the sd card ports on my pcmy generic class gig card has upload speed of mb write and a transfer speed of my sandisk i just bought it has an upload speed peaking at mb write and a transfer speed of to maybe if im luckythe write speed is ok but why is the transfer speed so much more low why isnt it at least mb if not mb if sandisk is typically so modest in their classificationsand whats the deal with the no classification marking on this sd card i dont see class anywhere on this cardamazon you will be getting this back
1,lots of hang worst performance ever battery backup is also poor wastage of dont go for it
1,i was not a fan of this recipe i should have noticed when it called for almost all canned ingredients that it would not be too tasty basically you just throw all the ingredients together and hope for the best i had to add an extra pack of taco seasoning so that this soup could have a better taste then just canned beans and tomatoes i also added sugar because the ranch dressing adds a sour taste to the soup that i had to cover up and some chili garlic sauce to give it a kick i would suggest to omit the ranch dressing all together matter of fact throw the whole recipe away and try again
1,dont waste your money not worth it for buying poor display quality and very poor sound quality and low battery backup not as mentioned in the website no backlight in this model of slim but with the same specifications with backlight in the slim model in the review there are some photos with other models not the same mentioned in the website worst experience from flipkart
1,i am so disappointed in this i had it on my registry and loved how cute it looked the sound functions are ok but the breathing motion is not as expected it makes a loud clicking noise and is not snuggly at all it wakes baby up and is not something they can cuddle with
1,i thought these were gorgeous and was going to buy them although the price was a bit high in fact two separate women came up to me as i was walking around the store and asked where i got the pants because the colors are so vivid however as we were looking at the items we noticed that both the green and the blue both had several small holes in them due to stitching quality as the previous reviewer noted therefore none of us purchased the pants the staff at the store were very helpful
1,never but this chuwi laptop it will have charging issue within five months
1,just started unmounting and remounting all by itself really sucked the battery life for a while there a quick google search showed this to be a common problem oh well
1,issues coming after days only regarding software
1,this is one of those dresses that looks so cute on the model but doesnt look anything like that in reality it has no shape and it fits weirdly all over i am normally a m and i ordered the s and it is massive
1,battery backup is very low fully charged it got discharged with in hrs
1,i am very disappointed and dont think i will purchase again much cheaper in the supermarketsthe picture is quite misleading the sizes arent as what is picture they are much smaller
1,this looks so cute on the model doesnt it i have no idea where you wear a suit with hot pants but it looks cute that said keep in mind the model is probably feet inches tall im feet inches tall and this jacket came down to my knees im not kidding the length sleeves were at my wrist so more like sleeves im normally a size in cartonnier jackets but this only comes s m or l the medium is really a size which was too tight across the shoulders and

1,this is worst product from asus and may be asus is worst in year my laptop has been dead times biggest mistake of my life
1,worst performance speed is very slow dont buy it
1,season is awful this is too bad because season is fantastic and funny and deep and hilarious and serious and dramatic and lovely again thats season dont bother watching season it seems to be missing everything fresh and original that characterized the first season the characters in season are a complete bore as well it was such a disappointment watching it after season the characters are predictable and stagnant nothing happens for hours on end the writing isnt near as good the whole second season seems to be based on nothing even the tarot card reader was a bore why
1,too sweet for my taste and not as good as i thought they would bevery disapointedwill not make again
1,i wanted to love these they are cute and warm but they have absolutely no elasticity im so mad at myself for not reading the reviews because i ended up wasting money on shipping pairs of leggings that i ultimately took right back to the store
1,lets start with the good the protagonist is a fanboy and hes a damn good actor its obvious that geralt is an emotional role that speaks to him and he knows the character and how to portray him the music is sublime the discordant fiddles in the music really capture the raw nature of the world thats being portrayed this might be based in folklore but its no fairytale here be monsters kings and peasants and all the violence that accompany them the cinematography is what i least know about but i find it to be exceptional the writing and the pacing is where it falls short herky jerky backwards and forwards through time with no notice and integration between the periods too much is left unexplained to the uninitiated those unfamiliar with the witcher universe which is a rich and engaging source of storytelling and entertainment quite frankly i didnt recognize this portrayal of ciri it didnt feel like her at all and i have no idea what her manifestations of power were meant to signify why they were important or how they pertained to the overall plot i just hope they pull it together for the next seasons
1,as the previous reviewer mentioned the pockets ruin this dress pockets usually such a good idea but here theyre misplaced right on the hips and made of the same thick ponte fabric as the dress so they stand out far from the body and completely ruin the line of the dress not flattering to have huge gaping hip pockets this makes an otherwise good dress a total loss
1,very bad audio clarity even it is not audible

1,i got this product exactly month and days ago prior to today it was working fine out of nowhere my micro sd card cant be read anymore ive tried several phones and different laptops both osx and windows and it doesnt even show up anymore be weary of the product you may end up with a lemon
1,its very bad product too bad days ago its completely not working worst item
1,actually a great series but giving it zero points because gina carano was fired for personal opinions that the showrunners have no business meddling in such things must be punished as a viewer i also have no desire to put up with a cast change in the middle just because a showrunner prioritizes their personal feelings over the audience actually a great series but giving it zero points because gina carano was fired for personal opinions that the showrunners have no business meddling in such things must be punished as a viewer i also have no desire to put up with a cast change in the middle just because a showrunner prioritizes their personal feelings over the audience
1,i poured this in kitchen sink drain and left it overnight drainage no better in the morning then got essential waitrose drain unblocker a few days later and it did the job
1,it is soft and hangs great problem i wore it one time and the back balled up terrible it looked like i had owned it for years not worn it one time wouldnt recommend though it is sooooo soft
1,really too bad experience in this price configuration wise very good but the performance is too bad i faced too much lacking and battery performance also average its only for basic use not for professionals
1,the material is beautiful and high quality however the cut is so awful it lays very weird near the neck and shoulder area it kind of forms this square but if you are larger in the bust area it causes the top to slant making it lay awkward
1,i usually love tops like this i bought this is the store because if was so soft got it home and was so disappointed because it is not very flattering at allwould be a great house top though because it is soft enough to sleep in
1,no return brand are not accept return very bad quality all time hank this laptop dont buy this laptop

1,i ordered the shirt bc it looked soo cute despite the fact many said this shirt was see thru its true had to return it
1,right out of the bag this top didnt really match the one pictured here it is the right top though the fabric was heavy and felt damp the way something feels coming out of the wash very odd and the fit is nothing like whats shown on the model the v is not fitted or nicely wrapped or even tacked in place it was just two loose droopy pieces so most of my bra was showing no matter how many times i put the pieces back where they belonged im neither flat chested nor busty
1,laptop heating within mins also fan sound is too loud totally waste of money dont buy this laptop after just installing one software laptop getting hanged on the first day only
1,i love all things dark i like horror addams family tim burton movies naturally i couldnt wait for this series to come out and i almost wept with joy because it was so good it was enticing exciting hilarious and so well done the music was great camera work outfits tim burton manages to bring his dark vision to life once again all of this cast was amazing they managed to give wednesday and her family a new spin without loosing the kooky spookiness of them i couldnt tell the end of this murder mystery until the very end escapism at its best i will forever rewatch i truly hope netflix renews the series for a second season
1,worst bro after using days one side speaker was not working properly
1,this was a disaster for me the jello turned into little balls when i whisked in the yogurt the only thing i can think of is that the yogurt was too cold and caused the jello to start to set maybe it would have worked if i had allowed the yogurt to warm up a bit first i had to throw it away
1,these are horrible pants they run small in the thigh and butt like other cartonnier crops look great at firstafter a few hours of wear the stretch out everywhere absolutely terrible i have several pairs of cartonnier crops that are my go to pants but these are not worth even the sale price id give them no stars if i could this fabric is very different from my other printed pairs if u must try them size down and suffer through the first few tight hours trust methey will
1,im a petite so as usual i have to order from retailer i saw this on line and tried it on in a regular size in the store even though of course it didnt fit the style of the tee was nice so i ordered it i couldnt have been more disappointed when i received it the quality was truly awful im not even sure why it is being sold the neckline was warped and wouldnt lie flat again the neck or chest the bottom hem was crooked it was really bad also having purchased tees in similar material befo

1,i loved this blouse when i got it and wore it before washing it fit really well and was flattering the only time i laundered it i hand washed it in cold water and hung it to dry the blouse shrunk at least a full size and in awkward places the sleeves are now tight and way too short the overall length shortened by at least inches the top is so tight in the bust now that the buttons popped open im very disappointed and surprisedi will be returning it as it is unwearable as is
1,i have purchased a lot from retailer but lately some of the items have been disappointing in qualityverses cost this being one the picture is nice but the actual blouse is nothing like this the size was not accurate so buy a size bigger because of the sleeves
1,i rated this recipe as it was written first it was pretty bland so i added a small chopped onion a minced garlic clove a handfull sliced mushrooms and t chicken soup base then i made the dumplings and i wondered about the thin consistency but cooked them anyway they never did cook all the way through more like dough lumps and the tasted bitter i ended up fishing them out and made another batch with c of bisquick and cooked them as directed on the box minutes uncovered and another with the lid on perfect dumplings although by now the broth had reduced to nothing and i was literally left with chicken and dumplings
1,dell laptop it is hanging
1,this product was very disappointing fabric was thin it has no shape and hangs like a pajama top so its not flattering at all at its really overpriced for what it is it might look good on someone who has the perfect body shape what wouldnt but they would probably still look like they went out in their pjs im and not wellendowed a b so it did nothing for me also the online picture of the moss version looks like its a greyblack combo its not it is really green
1,waste of money dont buy it i am regreting after buying this
1,the charger broke down within days
1,how how did this become top rated i dont understand if this was a crime drama maybe but this is nothing its artistic but thats it no substance no dark humor just people constantly talking and complaining its awful boring and kinda annoying i wish i didnt watch all of the episodes and did something productive and now i have regrets just terriblethis show is about nothing and the only show that was able to pull that off was seinfeld this was a failure and i dont understand the hype i just dont get it they got fantastic actors and actresses to fulfill this script this horribly written boring script i wish i got my time back from watching this
1,these are terribly unflattering the wash looks dirty and the rise is not like the description says which is the only reason i gambled on these it is
1,device is pretty slow c
1,i put this in my galaxy note ii and put a bunch of music and pdfs on it i also used it to save videos and photos it worked well for about months then on christmas day today it said that there was an error reading the card and the card was now blank my phone no longer recognizes the card and even putting it into its adapter and sticking it in the sdhc reader of my laptop doesnt workif this is sandisk quality then i am not impressed i am going to have to deal with their warranty replacement but id rather have a refund than get another card that might fail after months
1,dont waste your money by buying this product screen went dark in next day of delivery
1,at first we were satisfied with the music clock but we only used it to play the music unfortunately it doesnt work anymore after only months and goes out after a short time we would have promised ourselves a better quality from a wellknown manufacturer too bad

1,generally i find sizing at retailer to be very consistent so i ordered this dress in the same size that i order all of my other retailer dresses the bust was way to small so i had to go and return this and have the next size up shipped to me its till way too small in addition the shipping was terrible the dress was just dumped into a bag with no attempt to fold this and the right strap was defective its so irritating that i have to return this again
1,issue with hinge it shakes a lot and due to which camera focus delayed
1,the color is nice and the material is what you might find used by a high school drama club with a low budget a very cheap polyester on top of that it is unhemmed and unfinished in any way so you can bet that about the second or third wearing there are going to be runs all through the thing ive attached a picture of the hem below on top of that the ruching is awkward as mentioned by another reviewers all in all kind of terrible
1,i know this product description says oversized but thats an understatement i ordered a small and tried it on and i looked like a little kid in their fathers jacket i dont even think an xs would have worked im and about pounds for reference i will say that the embroidery on the back is very cool and this jacket is overall a cool concept but its just way too big
1,i usually love potato soup but my husband who loves this recipe made this for us twice and both times i thought it tasted just awful im not sure if it was the processed cheese or if the potatoes were just too starchyi know he would give this a star rating but i guess not everyone has the same tastebuds

1,i received this device with high expectations but right from day one the battery failed to charge beyond despite reaching out promptly to both flipkart and asus for assistance its been over a week and there has been no resolution the delay and lack of effective support have been incredibly frustrating given my experience i would strongly recommend steering clear of this product save yourself the hassle and look for more reliable alternatives

1,just not as long as in the picture it hit me at my hips not good
1,i ordered this in both an extra small and a small i found that there was a very big difference in the two sizes the extra small was true to size and had a great width but was shorter in length than i wouldve liked if it shrunk at all it wouldve been unwearable the small was quite a jump in size and was a little wider than i liked but i decided to keep that one the top was very cute and comfortable when i wore it however i just washed it once on delicate in cold water and when i
1,i am not a great writer this serial had me caught from the start the actors music costumes perfect tim burton at his best an absolute must see how to fill characters usually i only write reviews when something is very bad or very good i really love this show and hope next season will be as good as the first i love the macabre and i believe the main actrice will go far this show gives me hope for netflix in general this show could become great please dont mess up season where is johnny depp this is a tim burton movie after all johnny where are you you will come in season for sure this show gets from me a solid

1,hanging problem and not working properly software other problems
1,no bad
1,i have received laptop with faulty battery battery drain very quickly not last more then hours battery performance decreased below of its original capacity
1,this show has gory horror elements to it and it deserves an r rating but it was also the most wholesome and charming show ive seen on netflix in years the plot is a straightforward whodoneit set in a high school with a bunch of characters that were walking clichés but every single character was multidimensional well acted and the mystery was carefully constructed the ensemble worked well together and had on screen chemistry the characters were age appropriate the teenagers acted and looked like teenagers now what made this show utterly delightful was the whip smart dialog the primacy of friendships and the way the actors interacted with the fantasy elements of the world as an example the character thing was treated so warmly by the actors it gave it personality and became one of the more important supporting characters of the series as a whole
1,i have used this softener forever but why has the colour changed and the smell it is not as nice as it used to be whats happened
1,love the fabric of this shirt even though it was thinner than i expected it is soft to the skin and flattering however i returned it because it is made for women with long torso and shorter shoulders

1,i was using mine in a gopro hero the card just broke for no reason there is controversy weather its the gopro or sandisk but after doing some google research it seems that its more of sandisks fault as these sd cards also fail or used to in varies samsung devices phones tablets amazon sent me a replacement so no harm done but for the money you would expect something top notchgopro users on the support forums recommend getting xgb sd cards which have not had any issues as far as anyone knows the worst part is losing important content i was lucky i copied my movies from the sd card onto a hd on my pc others not so lucky
1,some time light lag problem not for good just office use only battery backup is not good hours only one time full charge
1,ill start by saying over the years i get more and more frustrated by the lowered quality of retailers products this dress represents all of my frustration cheap cheap cheap material low thread count elastic around the end of the sleeves that rubs the cheap fabric against your arm i mean this dress is a total disaster and looks nothing like the photograph shown
1,within first month motherboard died
1,the card only read as gb not gb i have formatted in various formats with various tools and operating systems i ordered a replacement and concluded this was a dud good luck buying this product rest assured amazon has a good return policy
1,one cant tell from the picture but the top shoulder part is sheet and transparent it also is very long almost dress length feels less quality than what retailer usually carries
1,this was terrible it looked good when i took it out of the oven and when i cut into it a ton of liquid came out i was so excited to make the pie and ended up just throwing it away would not recommend
1,very slow working very bad quality
1,this is one of my favorite series you should watch also they are connected but not necessary to see both to understand there is a lot of cursing but you learn to get past it the acting is phenomenal literally everyone in the show can act the storyline is attention grabbing through the whole series lots of twists and turns cant wait for the next season
1,ok ladiesyou need to know that this type of fabric is the one that will get holes i bought the white one it is super thin and lovely but i was only able to get two wears out of it i did wash it and it maintained its size because i restretched it while wet then hung to dry i was super disappointed about the wear but appreciated being able to return it without question at my local retailer

1,i did not like this cashmere sweater at all i ordered the pink which was more of a peach color although the color was very pretty the material was very thin and cheap looking it was also very short not worth the money even at off
1,i can always count on retailer to sell unique pieces so when i saw this sweatshirt online i ordered it right away its adorable and quirky however when i received it in the mail it reminded me of something my grandma would wear the sleeves are puff sleeves and are really long while the bottom of the sweatshirt hit pretty high on my waist that when i raised my arms my stomach was showing if this was a more tailored sweatshirt i would be keeping it but sadly its going back
1,wrong information high rate of interest wrong discount wrong tenure all mismatch with flipkart offer
1,had the gb sd card for a months before it died on me tried to swap it out and said warranty was only days long last sandisk product i ever buy
1,i always bake banana bread and its recipe is fool proofi tried this recipe last night and i am sorry to say it was not a very good one it took hours and still it was soggy so maybe if we put less buttermilk in it result might be different i like the taste of it tough nasira mansoor

1,i am sorry but this was not good at all very dry we threw what was left in the garbage followed the recipe exactly i have two other go to meatloaf recipes that i will continue to use what intrigued me was the crackers in it because mine falls apart a lot i will not make this again no flavor either i felt like i was eating dry hamburgers
1,the crumb topping is good but the sugar part with the apples is way to sweet
1,i couldnt even watch the whole thing i didnt think the acting was so bad but one character is more hateable than the next ive never hated connie britton in anything
1,not satisfied
1,started acting erratically after about a month its now been a little over a month and all my files are gone not all of them were able to be backed up i hope i can get at least the pictures back glad the s backs up photos automatically
1,bit of a snoozer it seems like the producers writers or powers that may or may not be hung their hat on one character of what was an ensemble cast show back in the day thats not to say that i was a fan of the old show id seen it when i was young but to me they took the prominent aspects of one character accentuated them and then tried to plug a storyline that could have worked with a recreationadaption of any old tv show or movie that addresses or even abutted the strange magical or supernatural world in sum the storyline might work on its own or accompanied by a better backstory but it ultimately fell short for also found it a bit immature
1,i received the otter as a replacement order because the first one on the electronic part was a bit defective now i get this one here which works normally but the quality of the fabric is not the same the otter has only a painted face while the other one was embroidered with the nose whiskers and the mouth which is of course qualitatively inferior with the replacement now i will probably have to send it in again and hope to get a reasonable replacement until the birth of my child at the price one should expect that
1,while it may be difficult to not shop at walmart due to their obviously very competitive prices versus their competitors the reason they are able to do this is because they cut corners everywhere else whether its the terrible conditions for their employees or the overseas labor they use as their supposed customer service department that dont speak english and respond only with automated scripted answers or the lack of any type of sales support at all once the initial purchase is completed until we as consumers stop giving them our billions of dollars each and every year you can expect to continue to receive the same star treatment as evidenced by the thousands of reviews posted here and elsewhere
1,complex and nuanced characters surprising incidents unusual setting both action and drama what more do you want in a tv series i bought the season for from itunes and am glad i did
1,display problem screen bleeding and low performance battery
1,battery very lowest and automatically over heatingsound quality poor
1,i wore this blazer for one day didnt do anything strenuous and the fabric started to disintegrate along the back next to the center seam its completely unfixable since its not the seam that split but the fabric itself what a waste of money as to the fit it is a boxy cut through the waist it looks better unbuttoned than buttoned the jacket also shows a lot of the shirt you have under it so its good over something cute or it would be if it didnt fall apart
1,very bad experience the laptop didnt work after day it did not start and was not charging also
1,battery condition not up to markdischarge very quicklybattery quality not good

1,i have no fiction every detail in it is actually performed in human history at the same time we are angry and sympathetic for the atrocities committed by women in gilead dont forget that it is the human atrocities that human beings impose on women the evil of human nature for the reality that has not happened yet that is our past the handmaids tale
1,agree with previous reviewer i am usually an xs p in this brand lbs but i could not get the internal slip over my head the chest area was fitted i am a b but then the skirt was very full and loose i could have cut out the slip but worried it would be see through and just not worth it at full price
1,please dont waste your money in this stuff other wise you will suffer i have got it today and it got stuck for hrs until now im trying to overcome this burden you can just imagine how a middle class boy adjusted to buy this the god will ask the seller and he will surely see the worse things in this very world hate this laptop if you wanna buy then buy some other but please avoid it

1,i guess i should be happy it failed after only month because i only lost months worth of pictures etc i bought of these cards for my wife son and i my wifes had a minor glitch which went away with a reboot mine had a minor glitch this morning so i expected the reboot to fix it no a reboot caused my motorola defy xt to tell me the card was blank and needed to be formatted my laptop wont even recognize the card when i put the card in its reader after a couple hours of looking for a way to fix it i have only found that this is very common for this specific cardedit i was very happy with sandisk after calling them they did say there are compatibility issues with class cards and some of the android phones and verified my phone is one of them they offered free replacement with a card that would be certain not to have the same issue mine just had and also to attempt recovery of my items from the card these are the reasons we buy sandisk in the first place they did recommend a class or lower card to me for this phonei am leaving this as a star because people should be aware of compatibility issues this severend edit as of march this replacement card that wasnt going to be susceptible to the same type of failure is losing apps etc i am giving this card up it has taken my phone and turned it into a device i cannot count on

1,man this dress is the worst i dont understand how it looks the way it does on the model agree with previous reviewer there must be a minimum of pins pulling the waves and waves of extra fabric back this dress looks so cute but is so so so disappointing in person sweater collar and cuffs stiff and bulky dress billowy and sacklike not sure how they got a belt to pull it all in save yourself the return and do not get sucked in by the sale price and extra sale discount like

1,not worth the money and below are the reasons speaker is at the backside of keyboard so when you play music the laptop vibrates display fittings were not upto the mark heat exhaust is releasing from the upper side of keyboard which means the screen can also get impacted by heat camera quality is too bad not as per expectations dell should work on build quality laptop charger is not type c instead it is still like old school round in shape different variatio read more

1,loved watching this it had everything suspense horror mystery thriller great acting and a very good plot jenna ortega was born to play wednesday it develops so much interest even if you have just watched the first episode it takes an unexpected turn of events the ending was literally very unexpected no one on earth could even have the slightest idea of the end it is basically based on a mystery which wednesday herself wants to solve and she solves it i kinda felt bad that the real monster was because wednesday just had a moment with him i am waiting for the next season to come and its officially announced it was teen stuff but if anyone has interest in mystery and typical high school story this is your best show to watch worth watching

1,ive worn citizens for almost years now i keep going back because i have an athletic figure my thighs and butt are bigger than my waist and usually citizens fit and hug all the right places and are made with a certain quality expectation these did not meet any of those standards the ripped as soon as i put them on the material seemed cheap

1,backlight not working
1,not happy by this order
1,this was a big disappointment all i could taste was the flour so anyone that makes this recipe should use less flour i might make this again but would defintely not use tbs of flour i think you need to experiment with this recipe to come up with the correct measurements i did go ahead and serve this but threw out the remainder

1,this is not a kimono its a cocoon theres a huge difference its also not made very well
1,color of the laptop is getting faded in just days of use color is getting faded feeling like cheated
1,after suffering over hours of watching endless episodes just like carrie bradshaw i couldnt help but wonder did i watch something else than the other viewers the music creepy later just unnecessary the characters white and privileged brainless people without any remarkable features no one likeable the story what story exactly happens and was shot in hawaii but from what i saw it could have been shot at any random fancy resort its marketed as a black comedydrama i have to ask where is the humour no laughter from me not even a smile years ago this slow pacing would have meant cancelling of the series after only one episode but nowadays shows like this are popular for whatever reason think bly manor i love jennifer coolidge but here she acts letargic and sleepy her comedic talent is not used at all in general the characters are flat almost not human like some bored slave holders where is the satire i am not a genius but if something is boring than i dont like it simple as that stars
1,i had it for a day before it died and lost all my data not what i expected from sandisk or any microsd card in this case

1,touchpad not working properly after some time open laptop the left and right side not working ids so terrible experience from acer and speaker was to bad because one side speaker is vibrating
1,just brilliant everything from the story the acting the photography along with the production and the direction this series just oozes the highest of quality the casting is superb and the quirkiness of the individual actors comes across throughout i particularly like emma myers portrayal of enid sinclair as the perfect foil to jenna otegas wednesday tim burton has always made superb movies in the comedyhorror genre and whilst his influence is evident its the juxtaposition of the nevermore community with the normies that sets this apart and adds a wonderful dimension to the whole story i could go on but im way too busy watching it
1,used it in a samsung galaxy s and it was ruined within a month second one i went through on that phone contacted verizon samsung sandisk google and read a lot of forums turns out a lot of people were having the issue with that phone and these cardsof course the girlfriend threw away the card so i couldnt return it so i dont know if the issue was fixed or if was a bad batch of cards that went out or what its been a few months and i havent seen the problem as much as before so i can only assume it was a bad batchive had another card in my phone for a while and havent had any issues so for now i cant recommend this specific card unless their issue has been addressed
1,i bought this on black friday last year and took a chance on it what chance u say i read some reviews that this card just actually stopped working for no reason and not due to abuse or misuse i had this card in my acer iconia a and it just stopped working even my computer doesnt recognize it wtf sandisk this is an expensive part for this to occur do not buy or if u do be careful what u store on it i only had music and movies on mine so nbd but what if u had this in your phone with valuable pictures

1,as someone who watches television as a form of entertainment and escape i absolutely love this show since i live in the real world i dont mind if what i watch is not so real its the same reason i read books and go to the movies and this is one fantastic escape it has been some time since i have found something i enjoy this much on tv everyone just nails the characters and i cant wait to see what will happen next
1,this show was excellent i really liked every episode the ending wasnt anything crazy it was a little lackluster in plot in my opinion and i laughed a little bit after seeing reacher get hit in the face with a crowbar and leave that near death fight with minor injuries and little bruising however other than those very minor things it was very nicely done and i thoroughly enjoyed it
1,this cardigan looked great on line but it is one of the worst things i ever ordered at retailer the quality is awful and the material feels flimsy and cheap
1,bad quality display dont buy this product
1,bad
1,i had high hopes for this dress but my husband said i looked pregnant and that i was wearing a tablecloth and he was right im usually a size so perhaps this would look good on a talk lanky person with a very long torso but probably not way too much fabric around the midsection its a shame because the fabric was really pretty but too stiff a hand to drape well
1,product stopped accepting charging and now is spoilt after just days of purchase
1,i bought the yellow pair on vacation last week and loved them i wore them home on the plane and had a pony tail holder in my pocket basic goody binder and there is a circle stain where the binder was so strange i sprayed them with spray and wash and washed them the stain is still there and now it is discolored in the area i treated them they are ruined i am so disappointed and i only got one wear out of them

1,easily the most horrible collection of characters ever do not waste your time
1,the addams family whichever iteration you prefer has always been a comedy first so why is this show not funny its played very seriously with wednesday trying to uncover a mystery becoming highly proactive this is a big detour from other iterations where the addams family really couldnt care less about anything but their own macabre home life sure the movies had serious elements and the addams were put in peril but they relished in it at deaths door gomez and morticia found ecstasy and the normies looked on in horror thats the appeal these deathobsessed goths clashing with the real world in this show morticia and gomez immediately take wednesday out of high school in the real world and put her in hogwarts all the weirdos wednesday meets kind of take the effect out of the addams family making her seem rather normal great acting particularly the actress playing wednesday and production value cant save the show from such an odd tone
1,this was a very odd fitting top i should have read the description more closely the colors are beautiful but the cut hit me in all the wrong places

1,my perspective is as a sewer so im more picky perhaps this top is poorly made the fabric pattern is crooked or not consistent in each piece sewers do this to save squeezing the pieces on the fabric it looks sloppy the cut is very full the bottom edge measures around for my figure curvey at and lbs this top is not flattering it looks maternity perhaps best on a slim figure and with leggings

1,there is no possible logic way of thinking that could ever justify giving this a rating lets say below a more production work went alone in the blaviken fight scene of the first episode than you will ever dream to experience this show is just awesome and you will see it rise withor without your toxic attitudes towards everything
1,the dress is pretty i ordered a and not knowing how it ran i took both back the neck is too tight
1,no it isnt great not even b category its your usual angsty teen flick where the characters are caricatures everybody possesses one personality trait that is inflated to absurdity wednesday always hates everything wears all black her roomie always loves everything wears all white theres an always stupid guy and an always angry bad girl etc i cannot overemphasise just how bad is wednesday of a main lead shes boring and annoying but most of all she is not interested in doing anything other then obnoxious stuff she is always being dragged by everyone surrounding her to do at least something of importance she does not make the story its the story who is begging her to do something interesting the plot itself is a pile of stolen cliches and plot devices we have a rip off from harry potter previous burtons movies and numerous netflix teen comedy shows tim burton what happened to you buddy i still can recognise his familiar style but just barely a pale echo of what he once been sad
1,please dont buy this product it is totally waste of money in only one month his mother broke
1,loved the look of this shirt online i tried it on and was sad to see that the frontal view is all wrong the cool shoulder design is almost too exaggerated almost looks as if im ready for take off unfortunately none of the featured photos on the product page display the frontal view of the model i really wish the shoulder design was slightly smaller in shape and size i would have loved it looks great from the side but sadly i cant walk around like that

1,im certainly a film lover i love weird humor in my eyes monty python is a master from my points of view it can also be at the expense of the wealthy and their quirks because the times are serious i longed for laughter and also for exaggerated humor im not a prude either i am also interested in innovative formats in streaming and television due to the masses of prices i have turned to this series i started twice for s and my interest is always extinguished after the first two episodes at s i made it up to episode has the understanding of humor changed so much since its complicated or crazy stupid love or monty python the series is extremely primitive humorless and also not weird why she was so overwhelmed with awards is unclear to me maybe the filming locations are decisive i also could not discover any excessive interest of the viewers in the streaming rating but i wish the cast actors a lot of fun shooting certainly a nice environment again and maybe there will be another emmy

1,every episode is boring and meaningless from showing poor russian robbers who are actually responsible for killing people in ukraine to the most predictable and stupid ending do not recommend to waste your time on watching this despicable and shameful show first two seasons were great but third one doesnt worth even the paper this poor scenario was written on hope after this disaster the producers of hbo will close the show the impression from the white lotus was completely ruined by the third season should have thought twice before showing russian murders as a victims of the war which they all support
1,the pie is tooooooo sweet use less sugar
1,no way to format it i even downloaded programs that claimed were able to format it after wasting about hours i decided to give up and send it back the seller should format them before sending them even if they would charge extra it would be well worth it instead of the hassle of downloading programs and wasting time trying and sending it back after hours of frustration
1,i loved this dress from the moment i tried it on so flattering to my postpartum body without being a huge tent soft fabric and for a whitelightly striped dress not sheer im bummed because after washing only twice followed the instructions to wash on gentle cycle and low tumble dry holes started appearing everywhere both on the cream ribbed hem in the front bottom and all across the chest in the white part of the fabric only it looks like the black stripes are holding the holes toget

1,this card had rave reviews so i decided to get it to use it with my new gopro hero camera i liked that it had a high capacity and it was class which would allow me to maximize the features of my camera as soon as it arrived i popped it in to the camera for a quick test run and after it was successful i then packed it in my luggage for a snorkeling trip days into taking awesome footage with my camera this sd card started resulting in sd card errors which made my data unrecoverable fortunately i still had some time in my trip to go get a different memory card with better reliability these memory cards appear to be hit or miss and in my case it was a miss i can not recommend this card for purchase it appears that this company has a problem with the quality control process and you can see that reviews are either overwhelmingly positive or as is my case starnegative it looks as though they just accept a certain amount of faulty memory cards unfortunately for me i missed the window to return this card because i was travelling and i am stuck with a useless micro sd card ive had better luck with kingston and transcend brands lexar and samsung have also served me well in the past i will no longer purchase any other sandisk products and i wouldnt recommend that you would either but if your are swayed by the reviews make sure you thoroughly test what you purchase before you actually need it
1,how cute was this little sweater and comfortable even in the south until i washed it i followed the instructions on the label being careful not to wring it out first of all the smell was unbelievable i washed it three days ago and it is still wet and damp and on top of that it shrunk even though i handwashed it line dried it and pampered it to no end

1,i an not good
1,this program is way more complex and sophisticated than you think it is is it about crazy rich white people yes but dont make the mistake of taking it at face value as difficult as it is to watch i have the feeling that something incredible is about to unfold like watching a train wreck in slomo you cant take your eyes off of it i find it fascinating even as im filled with apprehension not for the squeamish or easily amused it takes more effort and thats what makes it great

1,completely oversized top size medium was swimming on meboxy baggy shapeless what more can i say even in an xs this would not have fit in any way like the photo returned
1,despite cutting back on the amount of added sugar i found this cake to be too sweet and unnaturally pink it had an overwhelming artificial flavor it is difficult to keep the frosting from becoming runny no matter how well drained the strawberries are

1,every year for our family picnic my sisternlaw brings this pastry it doesnt make any difference if there is or in attendance theres always at least to of the pastry left over you would think that would be a hint that most dont care for it this july is was a goopy mess it had to be scooped out of the pan it was certainly under baked if you like the store bought kuchensdanishstreusel that is baked in the foil tins then youll probably like this because in my opinion thats exactly what it tastes like
1,these pants look nice and are comfortable but the quality of the fabric is terrible i should not be surprised because i bought another pair of pants by this same label at antro earlier this year and they did not hold up at all either but i thought id give it another shot never again im on my th wear and the crotch and inner thighs have worn away completelyi mean huge holes in the fabric where its just disintegrated even at extra off the sale price its not worth it the full price
1,initially theres a lot to like about this show its gorgeous promises an interesting set of conflicts between a ranch owner developer and chief of a nearby reservation who wants to use casino proceeds to fund buying back land for his nation the series focuses on the dysfunctional breakdown of the ranch family and his brood of selfsabotaging offspring unfortunately the plot gets lost somewhere and the series meanders into pointless drama and shock violence unlike succession or something similar where you dislike the entire family the sibling relationships arent well developed and dont represent the broader themes but if youre looking for something soapy or dramatic in a beautiful setting youll enjoy it
1,battery doesnt last at all but before i could realise battery has an issue return period is over days after delivery so now im stuck with a k laptop with no battery life
1,usually i really like deletta and know the sizing and shapes this top looked pretty in the pics and i thought it would be a nice change from a tee it was baggy hung low and the layers just looked boxy and shapeless
1,tags one quite huge about by very itchy so i cut out the tags and they are sewn with some kind of hard poky plasticy thread now even more itchy i will have to wear these inside out

1,display quality is very very poor
1,very cheap quality of product after one week of it started hanging working very slow
1,never buy this laptop cons display the display is very bad warranty the worst thing is that warranty was written on site but while doing product registration it shows carry on the laptop has already started lagging andacers customer support is very bad my opinion is buy another brand laptop pros it has no pros
1,third class dont buy
1,so true to the book and beyond best show on television possibly ever and the us is heading in this direction now with the dystopian and draconian abortion laws being enacted by republican states old white men for the most part deciding what women can do with their own physical and mental health very scary
1,the scope and scale of pb is a thing of wonder so many different strands come and go something from series will pop up in series the set dressing a speciality of british tv is everywhere the post wwi years are all there covered in dirt and blood murphy is stunning but so are the rest of the cast but he carries everything before him its maybe what he will most be proud of in the end just watch it enjoy it come back to it and see how high the standard of story telling can be
1,terrible not sweet at all not crisp generally repugnant and a waste of my time and ingredients
1,product has no quality the keyboard got damaged even with minimal use

1,display and sound quality is very chip display side negative view sound quality very low third quality sound
1,this sweater was so itchy i immediately was turned off it looks cute in pictures but another problem was that the knitting in the shoulders looks like a kid made it it was uneven and stretched out it looked like it was not well made to me it also shed so much that just from me trying it on my pants were covered in orange fuzz i returned this one
1,not happy with this product for lts its not concentrated and its says washes not what was stated

1,stopped charging within a week
1,so disappointing not good at all threw it all out
1,after months my laptop shut down all of a sudden and now its
1,the otter is at first glance very sweet but the electronic part is totally thick and noticeable so that the otter is hardly suitable for cuddles besides after weeks the electronics broke directly with us nothing could be played off a cheekyness for such a nameable manufacturer because this happened not only with this otter but even with the reordering
1,this dress is thin and completely see through it is definitely not worth the price tag would be really cute in a thicker material
1,automatically rebooting in the middle of work checked in google many are facing same issue with acer laptops
1,the yellow is not as bright as the pic and the tee shirt base color is more off whiteoatmeal making the shirt look much more drab in person than in the pics fit was ok but nothing special about this and will be returning

1,too much wet mixture bread comes out soggy
1,does not say ribbed did not want ribbed would not have bought ribbed
1,i should have heeded the previous reviewers advice but im really short so i thought id give it a try there is something really wrong with the bust first its about inches higher than it should be the bottom trim cut across the middle of my bust even if i hoisted everthing up in there to fit the cups they are really only designed to fit cones not curves from the side it looked hideous too bad because the fabric and fit everywhere else is gorgeous
1,i have been continually disappointed in retailers clothing for the past year i feel like their prices have soared and the quality has remained soso but dresses like these somehow make the cut it does not make sense since when did retailer exclusively market to older women no retailers market has always been young adults this dress is extremely matronly although the bottom print is nice the hot pink belt is completely mismatched and gaudy i really hope retailer starts curating better dress
1,i bought this on august of as of april the card stopped functioning it can still be read but the writing capability is gone thats less than one year im extremely disappointed in the longevity of this card my usage of it has been on my galaxy s i have about gb of data in it guess im going to have to look for another card that has a longer lifespan than this one
1,received product already broken at onoff
1,beautiful fabric with soft drape unfortunately the captain kangaroo pockets are awful unless you have a straight up and down shape with no hips this is very unflattering the pockets look like saddle bags and add a huge amount of fabric where most people dont want added bulk very disappointing returned
1,i have received the laptop with only one slot ram it was supposed to be dual channel ram the laptop is heating too much the cpu temp is going even at the slightest load i dont know what is going on the processor is limited at ghz it doesnt support undervoltage
1,i didnt realize that the grey sleeves are attached i assumed that was just an undershirt on the model needless to say it looks cheap and poorly made will be returning
1,dont buy this use less product simple waste of money
1,disappointed with the product it stopped working and wont turn on after just two days of purchase
1,the first season is really good the second one is embrassing unfortunalety just no progress poor characters and a very bad storywriting even the action parts are very bad directed in the second season at the first season the storytelling and the characters are very interesting the direction was fine and even the action parts were nice and thrilling presented but the second season destroys all the good and fascinating characteristics unfortunalety really bad storyline without any interesting topic poor perfomance of all actors and also bad action so i really recommend the first season pass the second and we all should hope for a good third one
1,terrible
1,having display issue not responding properly and quickly
1,not happy with the product once year is complete and the problem starts
1,nice laptop very worst product delivery service days before received near by hup but not delivered i will collect from the hup in between so many compliments no response ekart service after i find the hup
1,very dissapointed in these capsules the previous version which was the ultra with only two compartments was great because the capsules dissolved completely without leaving traces these leave small white trails on dark clothes
1,i love the teal color of this tshirt and the macrame design at the top is beautiful however the top is way too large i usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops so i ordered the size s there is so much fabric below the chest it fits like a maternity top i know if i order an xs i will have the same problem below the bust the top is not flattering and itamps a shame
1,bought these thinking they were the ordinary simple cleansing wipes as the packaging is the same even as exfoliating wipes do not find them good they are quite dry the actual wipes are dry i dont mean they leave my skin dry not a good product
1,processor issue
1,after days completely dead
1,this dress is so short i double checked to make sure i didnt get a petite by mistake im and ordered an extra small because of the deep v neck it fit well on top but you could see my underwear in the front seriously i dont even think miley cirus would wear it that short the lace was really beautiful so i was disappointed that it didnt work out
1,this cream burn my skin and i have a lot of spot i wont buy it again
1,after months it stopped working i got a new one form sandisk but im very apprehensive to put it on my phone
1,it worked fine at a start and offered great speeds but after a few months my cell phone started to eject and reconnect it several times per day at least once per hour that made my phone eat up its whole battery life in half the time i installed watchdog and noticed that the google process also incremented its cpu usage i read somewhere that it was caused by this kind of problems with microsd cards probably because the process was trying to scan the memory once inserted in another forum there are also reports of this kind of problems with some of the latest generation sandisk microsd cardsnow i decided to purchase a samsung one which can be found similarly priced my phone stopped acting up and its battery life came back to normal
1,i was hoping these would be like some of the lace shorts i bought from retailer last year that i loved so much sadly no first of all they run small i am between a s and xs in most brands bought a s in these because i like my shorts on the looser side these felt a little snug and short but i decided to keep them the first time i washed them they were ruined i followed the directions exactly and even put them in a lingerie bag in the washer plus a delicate cycle no dryer the lace is man
1,story is passable acting is good characters are annoying but the real problem for me is this combination of a zamfir like pan flute melded into a don ho back up band with the screaming background vocals from a tiny tim song with a continuous drum beat throughout break from this to the odd hawaiian hymn for a grander affect but ill probably keep watching because there isnt much else on now
1,it runs large loose or oversized tops dont bother me so i thought it would be fine but this just made me look wider then i am is thin and too sheer for me as well it was just so unflattering i had to return it
1,i was intrigued by the casting the buzz and the awards but as with many highly rated showsmovies ive watched i was severely disappointed i didnt laugh once at this dark comedy not one character is the least bit funny i thought at least the normally funny molly shannon would deliver unfortunately it was one boring scene and episode to the next there wasnt one intriguing character or storyline id anything its more depressing and boring drivel that netflix seems to push out eventually i kept watching to see how it ended oh how i wish i had those hours back in my life
1,i hate hate hate the new pump there seems to be no way to separate it from the bottle in order to get out the last of the lotion plus the new pumps opening is too big and clogs continually if vaseline does not fix this i will have to find a new brand after years of loyalty to this one shame on vaseline for fixing something that was never broken all to get customers to purchase a new bottle sooner
1,if you look through the reviews you will see that this card seems to have both a failure rate and a incompatibility with some devices i bought this card in november of and it worked great for a while the card started failing in my galaxy note in the beginning of january after reformatting and trying the card in other devices it still does not work please understand that this is not a user error but appear to be something wrong with the card itself i have tried the card in different phones with stock jelly bean with ice cream sandwich and with a cyanogenmod custom firmware all devices have problems and say blank sd card or unsupported filesystem even formatting the card in both windows and using android do not seem to fix the issue i was happy to find such a good price on a large microsd card but sadly it looks like you get what you pay for it does appear that some people are having luck so it might be worth a gamble of if you are feeling lucky if you do buy this card it would be wise to double check your backup process to make sure you do not lose pictures or videos if you have this problem i am glad i used dropbox for my phone so i did not lose any pictures or videos
1,dont buy guysslow working hanging problemno battery backup heavy battery heating charger quality is too lowno return option
1,worst product ever
1,the fabric wrinkles so easily and any slight moisture or liquid immediately turns into a dark spot on the blue greycondensation drips from a glass gel deodorant etc i tried the cream but its very sheer i had to return this dress not practical
1,i got stuck pixel in my laptop display
1,i have hands that are really dry and bleed due to eczema and this is the only handwash that dosent dry my hands out more and make them bleed
1,started using this as i could not find my old simple night cream i m not very impressed it seems to be causing me breakouts and eye irritation makes no difference to skin the sots make it worse
1,this card was used in a phone without a large amount of write stress which does shorten the life of the card it was not written to over and over in the phonethe card is now totally unwriteable on a mac a linux machine or the phone writes all seem to succeed but even lowlevel reformats dont actually do anything the exact same files are there after every change untouchable and frozen forever months of use out of a memory card and then a really weird failure like this neither the mac linux machine or phone reports any error is not acceptable quality from sandisk
1,this skirt has no closure along the slit i cant begin to understand how it could be worn as shown in the photoyou would be completely exposed it completely baffled me
1,as much as i buy from retailer this is my first review the pictures do not accurately show how large this dress is in person i wanted something that was a bit flowy but this was a reminder of little house on the prairie the most unflattering dress ever and since its only available online im not interested enough to try a smaller size
1,this is a very soft and comfortable jacket but it has holes in the pocket area it was returned to the store and the other jackets had the same problem although not in the same area the store was considering pulling the product off their shelves it is unclear if the holes are just the beginning of a pocket or what but it was flawed by everyone who looked at it
1,awful to sweet
1,some keys are not working properly performance is good
1,dont waste your money on this go for other model e th gen worst quality its build quality cheap its quality reduced

1,i wish i could say this card was great been waiting for it for around a year and a half whilst using the gb one also sandisk which never gave me issues sadly i lost it this card confused the heck out of me i used it on my s and first off it wouldnt recognize it tried it on my gfs s and same problemapparently it comes formatted as exfat and thought maybe reformatting it as fat would solve the problem well i thought it did since my phone finally recognized it upon inserting it a new problem arose though i started taking pictures to try it out and odd thing was some of the pictures became corrupted not even viewable on the phone seconds after taking them some worked others notlater on i restarted my phone for some reason or other a while later i wanted to check the pictures again and surprise surprise everything was gone id find out later that every time i restarted my phone everything on the card was being deleted tried it on my gfs phone and same thing happenedtried reformatting again as fat using gparted couldnt hurt and it just throws errors upon starting the write sequencetoo bad i cant return it as i had it shipped to me in guatemala so thats down the toilet i have to buy a new one now but i think ill go for the new samsung evo ones although they dont offer a gb model as of this writing bummer
1,i purchased this jacket in my local store size and runs really small i love the color combination and design but the fabric in my opinion is poor quality i have seen a lot of retailer use this poly spun knit in so much of their items and the jacket after bringing it home and looking in the light was already showing pilling looks like it is worn in an bad way returned the next day this was a big disappointment and every time i see this fabric being used in retailer clothes it makes me mad
1,im so disappointed in sandisk i bought this for my galaxy s phone worked great for the first few months suddenly i noticed some pictures were missing then it kept giving me an error that the sd card has unexpectedly stopped working then i tried popping out the card and popping it back in now it says unrecognizable files and it asks to format the mps i had bought and stored on the microsd card in a pinch just to see if this would fix my issues i formatted the disc now i lost everything and it is still giving me issues read some similar issues from other customers now im regretting my purchase save your money and headaches and buy something else
1,i didnt care for this one either as another reviewer noted its very rich and i love seafood too i ended up throwing it out
1,within days the keyboard is not working and other booting issues also arisei am not satisfied with this product
1,andor is the dessert to the feast that is the star wars universe it stands alone on its own merit with raw fantastic storytelling and yet builds and complements the universe it was born from its reminiscent of an old conspiracy thriller blended with the rich and limitless capacity of that galaxy far far away the show is incredibly immersive and authentic feeling from its characters to its environments all a part of a world of secretive gritty rebel networks and authoritarian imperial powers for star wars fans it tells a story they didnt know they needed about characters they didnt know they cared for and while expertly succeeding as a great star wars series it carries itself independently enough to also be the first piece of star wars media that can be watched and thoroughly enjoyed by anyone as just media its season two finale closed an original story perfectly at its end you really are left to collect your thoughts over its storytelling art and architecture that is the andor experience for the first time in a while incredible star wars is also incredible television
1,this is an absolutely beautiful dress but arrived with several holes in it
1,i read the other review that said the shirt was boxy i didnt think it would be a terribly big deal unfortunately it is normally i wear a size s so i sized down o an xs the shirt fits in the sleeves and neckline but the shirt is still very box and now super short unfortunately this is going back not a good fit adorable details but the fit is terrible
1,i got a new laptop days ago and it is still hanging
1,did not care for this recipe lasagna was very juicy also to much salt prefer a baked version
1,i bought a pair of these in stone and after the first wash they become all splotchy i chalked it up to perhaps there was bleach leftover in the my washer although nothing else in the load was blotchy i then because i loved the cut of these pants bought another pair in the darker blue color the same thing happened after the first wash again nothing else in that wash load was the least bit ruined just my new retailer pants such a bummer definitely a dye issue i called the stores i pur
1,i bought this sandisk gb class to use with my htc inspire after months i am getting constant error saying sd card unmounted unexpectedlythen today the dang fkang card wont even read in the card reader i have gb worth of videos and pictures memories that i will never be able to get back i am very upset
1,i ordered this dress in the green color the dress did not look like the picture i returned the dress since it looked like something to wear to a farm barnyard dance i returned the dress
1,not a laptop its just mobile big screen no option to laptop nothing can work please go for laptop model totally i but another mobile simply waste money
1,fast card while it worked died less than a week after return period expired must note though that that is the nature of any memory storage card or drive some fail some last forever not sandisks fault not amazons fault it is what it is but it is for this reason that i think amazon should extend the return period on items which fall into this category dont worry amazon i still love you but feel like your played the role of a proctologist on this one
1,really bland looked super delicious in the pic i would say skip the almond extract and use cinnamon in its place and instead of the mixture on top us a cobblercake crumble instead i think that would do the trick nobody in my family of liked it and im the only one that is picky so thats pretty bad
1,i am going to start spending a little more money if needed and start buying transcend the one transcend thumb drive ive purchased g works great and always has the sandisk g thumb drive always had some kind of annoying problem until it finally quit working everything ive been told to do to reformat and reset it doesnt help and fyi i always ejected the drive before i disconnected it these memory cards from sandisk that ive bought also have these little headaches all the time all my transcend work great and they have been faster to copy my g worth of music to spend the little extra money if need be and buy the transcend
1,i tried on and bought this shirt in my usual size and it fit long and loose but still had great shape after hand washing in cold water and air drying as per instructions on the tag the shirt shrunk significantly so much so that my stomach shows if i raise my arms at all it also lost its shape and now looks very boxy and is very unflattering i wont be wearing it and am disappointed i didnt even get to wear it once
1,it doesnt have a backlight keyboard so ge fooled by details provided by flipkartotherwise the product is good and display is okay performance okayy battery drains fastly
1,have used this for many years with no problem but it is now a different product which itches have bought it from different shops but it is still the same itchy product will not buy it anymore
1,heating problem and durability concern
1,this thing was such a disappointment it turns off after about a second of playing it worked well a couple times in the beginning so i was hopeful it was just a glitch because i didnt change the batterys from when it was in its packaging but no it makes no difference waste of money
1,laptop heating too much when its on and slow also
1,i was not a fan to bland and eggy for my taste i halved the recipe since there are only two of us and im so glad i did the sauce was good but the rest of it was just blah i will not be making this one again
1,enchiladas are made with corn tortillas not flour tortillas this is a burrito
1,peaky blinders sees a wonderfully aesthetic show that slowly throughout the seasons appears to sacrifice more of its depth for said aesthetics this shows most interesting character remains the iconic thomas shelby a wartorn man and a career criminal of genius intellect and disturbing psyche the lead is excellently acted by cillian murphy who through sheer verbal and nonverbal means manages to mythologise the character of tommy into something more despite a lack of an established character arc most characters besides tommy have charisma but lack layers character arcs that appear to be set tend to be overlooked awkwardly ignored and in worst cases retconned during the show the dialogue is poetic and engaging but feels shallow and forced at times season sees a haunting portrayal of a criminal world haunted by a brutal war crime is not glorified but lamented upon and the dirty side of that life is showcased constantly this however slowly shifts throughout the show when music and montages backed by setpieces take a foreground instead of character development and moral ambiguity the soundtrack does help set the tone for many scenes and immerses the viewer into the murky waters of birmingham
1,cant perform heavy task even having i h series too much heat poor ventilation heat up very easily cant play games update keys comes out even after minor usage hardware is very cheap
1,this would be great if you edited to include whipping the egg whites otherwise it doesnt work at all
1,i watched to the end because i wanted to know what happened and there arent too many episodes every single one dragged maybe because everyone has raved about this show my expectations were too high first of all yall who think those of us who didnt like it dont understand the social commentary are wrong its not really a revolutionary social commentary but then i am a working class stiff whose done more than my share of interacting with entitled people let me tell you that its certainly not just the rich ones the commentary about how native hawaiians have been pilfered from time and again all while having their culture commodified by same thieves was the one theme i thought was well done and novel even that didnt go hard enough though tourism is destroying hawaii people will look at this and go well i dont go to fancy resorts or act like a jerk to staff so i dont need to examine my impact most people are not selfaware enough to see themselves reflected in unlikable unrelateable characters stop traveling to hawaii people i worked at a hotel and there were times i was very much reminded of my incompetent supervisor who would use the rooms to sleep and do drugs am i supposed to have empathy for this guy who got himself killed at first i did that waned with each passing episode as he kept doing dumber stuff i was constantly thinking what did you think was going to happen starting with him sending the couple out on the funeral boat any person with common sense would realize that would escalate the situation if youre going to make a social commentary about rich entitled white people behaving like colonizers why muddy the message by making this character unsympathetic i will admit it is accurate in that it shows that people in positions of management are often some of the most incompetent people steve zahn trying to be sexy by being a monkey was one of the small handful of things i found funny i like cringe and dark humor but this show did not feel like a comedy at all to me dark comedy is supposed to still be funny and this show decided that gratuitously provocative was a good enough substitute the question i asked my family at the end was what is supposed to be the takeaway here i mean specifically from the death and its causes frankly it feels like the death was simply a hook to get you do watch all the episodes to find out who died it didnt feed any of the points that were being made i gave this show stars because the acting is well done
1,most of my reviews are positive this product failed could not read on my device a galaxy s nor on my computer with different readers in less than days the customer support is also unhelpful as they would only replace the card after many questions they would not provide a refund i did not want a replacement of a card that failed so quicklyi would suggest buying a different card it is not worth the hassle and lost data to save a couple of dollars with buying this one
1,totally west of money so slow work
1,as discerning readers of andrzej sapkowskis novels and players of cd project reds games will know the witcher universe is a rich and sprawling tapestry of interesting characters deeply emotional plot lines fantastic creatures and settings and a uniquely easterneurpeanflavored take on the fantasy genre it is an understatement to say that the witcherverse is a gold mine for an ambitious liveaction show producer that also means it takes a special kind of talent to squander this potential in the way lauren schmidt hissrich and her sapkowskihating writers managed to do following their five easy steps you too can become a failed showrunner despised by fans across the world step hire a popular lead actor that is very familiar with the source material then promise this actor and all the fans of the source material that youre working on a faithful adaptation of the stories they know and love all while knowing that you intend to do no such thing this step is important because if you dont hype up fans of the original content they wont be as massively disappointed when you inevitably fail to deliver it is also important because your lead actor will feel that he has been suckered into a project under false pretenses and when he tries to correct your flawed writing you can then accuse him of being toxic towards the women in the workplace they really did this to henry cavill of all people step hire writers that actively dislike the source material that your show is based on this will ensure that your promise of a faithful adaptation cannot possibly be kept it will also make them more likely to project their own views onto the stories as required in step again they really did this step whenever you deviate from the source material do so in ways that dont add anything new or interesting to the story your mantra should be replace the good with the bad related to this point make sure that your deviations are also completely unnessecary this will help the viewer feel confused about your contributions to the story step shoehorn as much of your own private politics into the show as possible people hate being told what to think so you must do so at every turn the more your viewers are thinking about realworld politics and current events the less theyre concerned with immersing themselves into the world youre creating if you can make it really obvious and jarring they might not even be able to concentrate on the story at all winwinwin step never listen to criticism no matter how well reasoned or constructive it is when disappointed fans criticize your first season make sure you have a character breakt he th wall in the second season to directly berate and belittle those disappointed fans when your now thoroughly disaffected lead actor tries to carry the show back on track stand in his way and make is as difficult as possible for him this way he will eventually give up and quit if you follow these five easy steps you too can ruin a show even if you have talented actors directors technical staff and tons of money at your disposal
1,nice product but display quality is very very poor battery pickup best hours
1,super itchy had to return
1,this dress didnt work for me at all im ft tall lb i usually wear size l but based on the reviews i ordered an m the material of this dress is very soft and fuzzy color is about the same as pictured also length is appropriate dress is very thick and warm the fabric however has no stretch at all dress is very specious and shapeless there is allot of room everywhere except shoulders sleeves i thought that area was tight snug which is strange because it runs large everywhe

1,i havent figured out yet if im a dummy or if i have a defective card i dont know if the card is bad since i cant even get the card to stay in my samsung galaxy s the little card will go in the larger one wont but it wont stay in if i put pressure on it the samsung says preparing sd card but as soon as i release pressure the samsung says card removedthis card came from a source outside of amazon and took way to long to get here it arrived in a white envelope with no instructions im very upset about this purchase as ive never had a problem before with either sandisk or amazon ill try to find someone with more experience than me to give this a try before i return it i would have expected this to come in a package from sandisk like other sandisk products ive bought in big box stores or from amazon but it did not
1,the white lotus isnt your typical sunshineandsearesorts kind of show it gleefully throws a grenade of social satire and dark humor into the mix the result an utterly entertaining journey that will have you glued to the screen the magic lies in the characters we meet a whole tapestry of wealthy vacationers each with their own set of problems bubbling just beneath the surface the beauty of white lotus is how these characters despite their vastly different backgrounds keep bumping into each other their connections both hilarious and unsettling a seemingly innocuous request from a guest can spiral into chaos for a staff member writer mike white masterfully weaves these interactions creating a sense of delicious tension that keeps you guessing what will happen next but white lotus isnt all doom and gloom sharp wit and wellplaced comedic moments punctuate the drama creating a perfect balance that keeps the show from becoming too heavy youll find yourself laughing out loud at the guests outrageous antics even as you cringe at their obliviousness so if youre looking for a show thats entertaining thoughtprovoking and just a touch unsettling then white lotus is the perfect escape just be prepared to be captivated by the dysfunctional vacationers and the paradise that slowly unravels around them
1,battery drain problem
1,i really liked this shirt the one time i got to wear itbut when i washed it according to the directions on the tag it shrunk a lot the sleeves are now too tight and it is much shorter thinking about returning it to the store but in any case i cannot wear it again
1,tim burton is back with a very fun dark and dynamic show a reminder of his talent finally he chose a representative and diverse cast with outstanding performances by all the actors involved they all do a fantastic job with their roles with jenna ortega stealing the show its like the role was written for her she is humorous dark and beautiful the dance scene in episode is just magic the chemistry between the actors was also spot on i enjoyed that throughout the story the characters bring up themes around loneliness death love emotions family existential aspects we all hold close to us great direction and cinematography nothing less than expected from tim burton the music accompanying the show is syncing amazingly with the scenes he takes you to another of his magical worlds with the addams family in the centre of it
1,so thin and see thru its not even wearable in public extremely cheap and ill fitting for any price let alone this price i feel like they will rip the moment i wear them out going back
1,edemars x x x
1,from the photos i thought the design was embroidered in reality it is stamped on there is a tiny bit of embroidery and a few sequins but overall the design is just printed on the fabric i didnt feel it looked good in fact it looked kind of cheap to me so i returned it the overall style of the jacket was great and it would have looked equally good for work or casual i was disappointed it didnt work out
1,like other reviewers i saw this dress on the cover of the catalog and knew i had to have it well i am very disappointed the colors arent as rich as the outdoor photo although theyre brighter than shown in the studio photos this is just not a flattering dress ive put it on three times and taken it back off the neck is too high the sleeves are too narrow and i have really skinny arms and theres no swing to it i am and weigh pounds and bought a size small which is what
1,after sale service is very very bad after a week of purchase windows is crashed
1,please dont order through flopkartflipkart they will cheat you by sending poor quality product and will try polish your brain that please contact customer care totally i fedup with this i have ordered this for emergency work when i receive it it didnot work when i contacted customer care they are saying please wait for week then saying that please contact acer customer care even acer customer care not responding many my calls they are cheating note that flopkart not flipkart
1,despite presenting a set of largely unlikeable characters behaving badly in luxurious settings that most of us will rarely or never experience the white lotus is gripping and involving drama its strength lies in its singularity of purpose created and sustained by mike whites deep involvement with all aspects of this production from the writing upwards this is aided by a wholly convincing and excellent performance from the entire cast as is made explicit in a scene hommage in the second series this series shares much of the same concerns that fascinated the great italian director michelangelo antonioni and knowledge of antonionis movies and sympathy for that directors vision adds a great deal to the enjoyment of the white lotus even though it is far from necessary to fully enjoy the show of the two seasons broadcast so far i enjoyed the first more than the second partly because it was fresher but its easy to see why others might feel the reverse both seasons are variations on much the same themes sharing structural elements great care is taken in integrating dramatic symbolism throughout its very easy to see why critics have fallen hard for this show it is very seductive for anyone versed in the history of drama in all its forms this care extends to the musical score and cinematography in the end despite being well aware of the effort made to make the characters as wellrounded and humanly relatable as possible i still had the sense of an outsiders view into a type of world that ill never inhabit but that didnt diminish the fascination
1,arrives with a broken lid leaked all over the box half a bottle left
1,too heavy performance not good
1,although andor takes its time building its world and intrigue in the end its time well spent by the time season concludes we have the basis for a great series a star wars universe with some grit and determination beginning the fight back against imperial overreach and aggression this is proper scifi something i think the star wars movies have ironically and somewhat inexplicably struggled with perhaps due to scale and the notion of blockbusters needing to be so enormous that in the end its detail that suffers but andor is carefully realised it has the elements of human drama and enough of the scifi content to remind us where we are and whats being fought against having said that the portrayals of the empire are perhaps a little too dimensionally fascist now its time for andor to change up a gear for season
1,i still need to watch s of the peaky blinders but ive heard it sucked well so far i still enjoyed watching it the storyline the acting and the character development is splendid some episodes could be rather dullboring but this tv show is just amazing
1,i did not care for this at all dry and not flavorful maybe because i used a bigger crock pot then the quart i did everyhting else as the recipe said only cooked for hours i prefer the oven baked version sorry
1,this jumpsuit is so cute and it looked amazing on i had to return it because of the poor design it was extremely hard to put on and take off there are so many buttons to do and undo which are not as easy as snaps the fabric buttons definitely make a great look to the jumpsuit but there should be a zipper on the side for easy access or use snaps instead of the loops for the fabric buttons what a shame of a lovely and classy design on a good quality material but not worth it if its difficu
1,i used to use this all the time however since the newer one came out more rounded can design i can never wear it anymore since it irritate like crazy and skin go red and dry
1,i was able to get this on sale when it arrived it was missing half of the rhinestones i am very surprised that this top would be sent out this way it also was missing the little bag with extra stones im reaching out and wondering if anyone else has experienced this and is there a store that sells rhinestones like the one on the blouse any help from anyone would be appreciated i hate to part with this but where was quality control
1,do not buy this or any other simple products as they have changed the preservatives in them i have come out in a bad sore rash my eyes are burning and my top lip tingled i had to wash it all off i phoned simple and she told me they have had a product change in all their stuff changing the preservatives when i asked why she just said i dont know it just changed i want to know why theres no good reason except maybe for them to save money using cheaper ingredients ive used simple products for nearly years since nivea did the same and sold their company to a german company who changed all their products im really angry about this what am i supposed to use now i have very sensitive skin and simple was ok but now its rubbish im skin is sore burnt and simple just dont care please be careful as i usually stock up when my products are on offer but fully asda gave me a refund onto a gift card as i didnt have the receipt for the bottles i had or id have been well out if pocket
1,the material is thin and of poor quality it snagged the first time i wore it the arm holes are very low as other reviewers stated
1,better condition is to bad material also very cheap
1,absolutely rubbish the pc crashed on the first windows update when the incident was raised they changed the mother board but couldnt retrieve the data in the laptop which is absolutely unacceptable donot purchase laptops online
1,bought one of the smaller sized bottles of the same softener to compare quality and was disappointed to find this was much thinner than the kind you find in the shop has been heavily diluted so no real saving will be going back to getting it in the shop and cancelling my subscription
1,the product has leaked over all my order do you have any suggestion why i can do
1,this was so boxy and unflattering i loved the lining and the fabric was very soft but it looked like i was wearing a bag was hoping to use this as a cute top layer for dresses but it was a terrible fit sizing down would not help this one went back
1,ms office not installed worst experience many other laptops have pre installed ms office but this dont have
1,dont by the flipkart its west of time chip products low quality products
1,had it in my samsung tablet and it went bad after months wont let me reformat or read it or do anything with it money down the drain
1,dont buy this product after few months have a motherboard issue and dont solve this problem simply waste
1,i loved this tshirt when i first tried it on a good cutnot too drapey or fitted but then i washed it laid flat to dry and it shrunk so much that its unwearable now so disappointing
1,received two today and they have made in china imprinted on them although they were detected and formatted fine to capacity in both samsung phone and tablet lets see if they hold up and not suffer premature death like many have reported thinking i shouldve gone with made in korea samsung sd cards instead if they had gb sizeupdate bought two and one year later with very light use one of the cards started locking up the phone with wait or close prompt when deleting files off of it shouldve gone with made in south korea samsung card sandisk is garbage these days
1,i wanted to love this top looks so comfy and cute but hangs like a bag going back
1,flickering and lines
1,followed recipe exactly and casserole did not rise daughter made it a few weeks ago and had same results perhaps a x baking dish is too large
1,has anyone noticed ritchson gained about lbs of pure muscle for season two where does a guy whos always on the road walking no less manage to gain that much muscle masswithout a gym membership his only companion is a toothbrush not a nationwide gym membership in the books the character is wellhoned with a fit body but this guy looks like hes trying to outdo schwarzenegger and his amorphous body has changed multiple times in the first three episodes of season two in one scene he looks bloated and overweight and in another he looks much slimmer and toned in still another scene he looks like the hulk and the next hes back to normal thats because they dont film scenes in order so the discontinuity is offputting why hasnt a producer told him to cut back on the protein shakes his caloric intake is way too high for the energy hes expending a common mistake that weightlifters make as for acting i rely on the other characters to provide dramatic relief ritchson is an okay actor but if he spent half as much time in acting class as he does working out hed be downright shakespearean while i do like the plot lines and the developing backstory the action scenes are too few and far between and they should never put ritchson against an accomplished actor like the detective in season two amazing performance but all in all i like it the new more muscled look of ritchson in season two will make you do a double take its more distracting than useful
1,enchiladas are made with corn tortillas
1,i was really disappointed after reading many of the reviews i decided to make this recipe it is the worst banana nut bread recipe ive made i really have no idea how it was a contest winning recipe
1,support is very worst key board problem i try cc but any one not response
1,really unattractive shirt nothing good i can say about it horrible fit i cant imagine this would look good on anyone
1,produc is good but after one month get disturbed before use
1,performance is fine battery life is around h some random chinese company charger w included in the package not an original acer charger the fan output is directly in front of the screen it will definitely damage your screen in the future sound quality and intensity both are average graphics is intel integrated uhd graphics not iris xe sometimes wifi disconnected automatically not for all networks file copypaste speed is extremely slow
1,the photos online make it look like a comfortable relaxed lightweight early fallspring cardigan when it arrived it looked very wrinkly and there is no shimmer as far as i can tell i tried using my steamer to get some of the wrinkles out but it didnt work it looks too rumpled and i dont want to wear something that looks like i just rolled out of bed
1,jennifer coolidge made the show and dont kno what happened to the writers but after the first season that was so good they should have stopped the show season two was ok and now after three episodes of season three is rather cut my eyes out then be bored to tears for another hour i cant believe i wasted three hours of my life on this season so sad because the show had such potential dont know why reviews need to be six hundred characters how many different ways do i have to express my disappointment and that the producers owe me money for wasting my time again dont be cheated watch something else ps one second of a shirtless guy being told hes a douche isnt a show
1,there was pretty good potential in the first two seasons although questionable story mode with the time jumping and all but season first episode made me think of xena warrior princess but i dont wanna insult a cult classic as of episode its theyve more or less dropped the political plot line and the horror theme is but a memory this is a family show now parents trying to raise a moody teenager and a funny hard dropping witty one liners that make the others go oh jaskier with a tilted head full scenes of complete character s sad pathetic and will appeal to a much broader easier public rectums
1,i hope you have better luck it has gotten a lot of great reviews but first the sticker covering the contacts on the back fell off then the card died completely hopefully its an isolated incident but im trying a different brand in case its a bad batch
1,i really wanted to love this dress but i couldnt it ran large and heavy rather than a sleek cocktail dress it felt more like a heavy sack once i put it on there was one upside the drape in the back did not appear to drop quite as low so finding a bra to wear under the dress might be easier than if it draped as low as it appears in the picture
1,i had great hopes for this recipe after reading the reviews but we were very disappointed i made it for dinner last night and the only adjustments i made were to add white wine to produce more sauce but it was still far too dry and to top the pasta with the shrimp mixture before broiling we also thought it was very bland with the amount of garlic and lemon juice we thought it would taste better ive been thinking about how to improve it add lemon zest saute the shrimp in the butteroil instead of simmering in the liquid ive decided to use other shrimp scampi recipes instead the crispy broiled topping was wonderful so will try that with another recipe
1,i really wanted to love this but the cut was very wide short and crooked after it was washed once it was completely unwearable because it hung all wrong
1,ordered it on never received the first supposed shipments then days later an envelope arrives with a counterfeit sd card that was detected as fake with htestw software after writing only mbs it crashed several times no hologram or individual serial number on the chinese knock off packaging either make sure you know where they are coming from only buy these from reputable authorized dealers its worth the extra couple bucks to avoid this frustration
1,tommy shelby you just played like a boss best show i have ever seen
1,i was looking for a casual dress for quick errands that was trendy but comfy this dress had a lot of potential i was drawn to the print but the material is awful so thin and scratchy immediately went back
1,i have purchased two of these gb sd cards and used them in an android phone and in a video recorderafter about months usage in my phone the card would randomly unmount and it took many remounts or reboots to get the card to work again eventually it stopped accepting writes at all and couldnt even be formatted although i could see what was on therei repurchased the card and after a couple months the same thing happened again random unmounts i moved the card to a video recorder where it worked for a while but even with a different usage pattern it died againi have had no problems with gb cards so far im staying away from this generation of gb cardseditgetting these cards rmad was quick and easy i had a lexar gb sd card die too and i sent the cards in all at the same time i havent gotten an update from lexar but i got updates and my replacement from sandisk supposedly there was something fixed in this new card revision i hope so
1,charger stopped working under month
1,i thought this dress looked so cute and comfortable and was excited to try it on and i was majorly disappointed it was incredibly unflattering in every way as a few of the other reviewers mentioned if you have any sort of bust the dress will not hang nicely the waist band was too high up and made me look pregnant im and curvy and usually take a lg in retailer but thisewww i will say the color and material are gorgeous but im guessing this is the type of dress that would look bes
1,the beadwork is gorgeous but the sleeves are so puffy it looks as though youre wearing shoulder pads the fabric of the shirt isnt that fabulous either
1,third clads
1,dont buy this choose windows laptop not a chromebook
1,the oled display on the asus vivobook go is truly impressive with its vibrant colors and sharpness however the overall performance of the laptop is quite poor it struggles with basic tasks which makes it hard to recommend this model to anyone asus really needs to work on improving the processor to match the quality of the display
1,i loved the look of this sweater but the workmanship was surprisingly poor there were missed stitches and loose threads throughout and even a tag sewn to the outside retailer was great about the return i really wanted to keep it and was very disappointed
1,this bread was terrible was hard to get out of the pan because it slightly overflowed nothing but a gooey mess waste of ingredients
1,i made the mistake of ordering without checking the reviews cute design but not as comfy as it looks returned immediately
1,i was really excited about this sweater but the fit was terrible the sleeves were the right size but the body of the sweater was a tent absolutely no shape they must have clipped the sweater on the model for reference im and pounds and ordered a size small
1,not buy this product
1,turned into melted puddles in the oven i had the sneaking feeling the egg whites should be whipped and then sugar added etc but i followed the video and written instructions to the letter and just ended up with a pile of coconut and the cookie part bled out all over the cookie sheet like a pool of water how did you guys make this recipe work im so curious because there are many positive reviews would like to know how to fix it
1,battery backup is very bad
1,i was so looking forward to an awesome maxi dress this was not it completely see through i guess you could wear it as a bathing suit cover up but be prepared to knot the length or you will trip its an odd design absolutely not worth the price i purchased the smmd and i could have for two of me in the dress returned this piece without looking back
1,i wanted to love this sweater but it is a return it is a very weird fit very thick ruglike material and unfitted the shoulders are bulky the top is big and the booty is small i am c and typically wear a small the arms were very long way too long i will say other than that the top was true to size may look okay on someone who had a larger chest and a smaller bum
1,if humanism shifted the focus of art from heroes to ordinary people then the proper modern art in my view descends from depicting the ordinary to depicting disease yet this descent does not hinder the lavish interweaving of puccinis operas it is the same kind of beauty even if the guests at the white lotus are immensely wealthy their status does not make them heroes but merely vessels of disease like that of any other modern person their world collapses to use kunderas word in the art of the novels however the invention of modern art lies in its exploration of the self opening up an entirely new world
1,looks terrible calorific and basically junk food please learn how to cook
1,two words baby yoda that baby is the cutest thing that happened this decade and theres no saying no to it
1,these are light and airy and pretty they also tore the third time i wore them and not on a seam a little above the knee while i was lying in my bed they also do not slim the figure and the fabric is slightly seethrough as it is so thin therefore if you are looking for serious lounge pants great i would not leave the house in them or turn over in bed in them when i sit the slits fall down around my thighs my son complimented my dress the other day because the slits give way
1,i purchased these pants while on vacation because i thought theyd be the perfect addition to my comfy travel wardrobe on my second wear i happened to be on a longhaul flight when the entire side seam split about a food long on my upper outer thigh luckily id packed a backup dress the pants werent tight at all but the seams wrent strong enough to handle a little pressure from sitting i guess poor construction i would not recommend these
1,very disappointedat times in less than one year sparingly used laptop the screen just goes blank and nothing happens even after ctrl alt delete or esc or rebootingregretting my decision
1,hanging problem ispeker sound qulati veri bad
1,i got the blue it is very short one side of the shirt i received was shorter that the other the material feels cheap and pleats out a bit right over the bust only flattering on small busted models
1,item was damaged and unable to pour without spillage have transferred to another bottle as unable to wait for replacement
1,i love anything orange when i saw this coat online i ordered it as i loved all the features the features of the coat are fun however the coat came all bunched up in the package i let it hang for a couple of days but the wrinkles were awful and even steaming and an iron would not take the creases away i tried the coat on the buckles were poorly made i ended up returning this jacket
1,this shirt was so weirdit does not fit like the photo at all there seems to be missing a stitch or something at the top as it is wide open until the bottomwhere it meets the other layer i could wear a tankcamisole underneath but it still just did not fit right i do not have a large chest but this was ridiculous beyond that the red color was just okay even though i purchased this on sale it was not worth the price and i returned
1,i hate the product
1,it has everything you want in a show action drama suspense and great actors and actresses they didnt forget anything
1,unable to start black screen coming while updating systemwaited almost years but no use
1,hahahathis dress is hilarious it looks nothing like the image i am usually a xs and was the smallest size available so i ordered it when i opened it it felt like lbs of fabric i thought maybe i ordered a size way too big until i could barely squeeze into the top of the dress once i looked in the mirror i almost fell over laughing the rest of the dress is huge i dont believe this dress would be flattering on anyone
1,after months amazon sends me a new one
1,im sorry to say we thought it was quite disappointing it was missing something but i dont know what even tried adding some sweet hot chili sauce but still lacking flavor wont be making this again
1,please go back to the old capsules these new ones make our household suffer a terrible allergic reaction constant hay fever
1,yennefers story was very bad and his character unlike geralt was hated

1,does not work more than seconds very disappointed
1,office work photo shop working but gaming not performance
1,i bought this product last week and now the laptop fan is not working i dont know why
1,cute but not addictive
1,the gb card i purchased actually contains gb of flash memory and some kind of hack that causes it to appear as a gb drive in various drives and readers of course this took me a while to figure out since i only just got around to copying more than gb of data to the card but with some testing i have nonetheless discovered this to be the casethe card i bought was in amazon frustration free packaging i dont know if cards purchased that way are less likely to be counterfeit than retail packaged versions but i suspect that i will stick with manufacturer packaging from now on
1,recipe sucks there was a lot of liquid in the bottom of the pie even with a lattice top
1,you did not include cream cheese in the ingredients recipe fails
1,battery problem and hang problem with in days and no return policy from company so totally west of money
1,the show is purely what every star wars fan want from lucas films it has its moment of laugh fight adventure and mystery the good thing is the originality of the story without any interference from any previous star wars storyline even if you didnt watched the star wars series this show has completely different storyline and you wont feel cast away and if you are a fan of star wars then mystery is awaiting for you i have spoken
1,no good
1,after reading the other reviews i still took a chance on ordering this dress becasue it looks so cute on the model the dress they sent me is not this dress it is the same material although the one i received had only one stripe down the canter like a cross there was no v back as stated by the other reviewer it was scoop and if you pulled it down the neck went up the dress i received is branded as holding horses while the brand listed on here is rava the length measured at not the st
1,ok listen its a good teenage drama but it has almost completely ruined the idea of the addams family it is just another teen drama not the witty comedic weird movies wednesday ok not jenna ortega she was incredible but the character was kind of boring and honestly watered down there was no emotion or personality whatsoever and it got tedious quickly wednesday is a classic character who needs a certain level of strange i found a lot of the time the family in general would contradict themselves in their lines shes quirky not a terrible human being pugsly waste of time adds very very little to the show honestly just there to be there morticia shes ok but she doesnt have that confidence attitude and yet charisma in her character that is needed gomez just no he is just gross in the show and irritating as well as having zero personality does not add up to the movies or originals the thing that irritates me is the fact of how many new fans who make this their whole personality cannot fathom what the addams family is meant to be and their classic characteristics it is just a trend now to be like this wednesday and just forget about the original characters and storyline this is merely a disney teen drama no but to be fair this is just me complaining and not looking at the bright sides
1,i purhased this thinking i was getting an amazing deal the price was right the product was not after a few months i am unable to delete or add files pics or music to this microsd card i am only using gb of space on it i cannot add anything nor delete anything it wont even allow me to format it and start fresh i am not happy with this product and extremely disappointed i use my phone a lot and store music and pictures on my phone for various purposes i would recommend buying another gb microsd card one that is more reliable
1,st and nd seasons are a solid and overall a very good time rd season is like at best very very undercooked characters and plotlines despite being the longest season not the biggest fan of the ending either mostly because of the setup done throughout the season went basically nowhere probably the least impressed i have been by the writingalthough it might also be the magic of the premise starting to wear off for me by this point so im less willing to overlook things or maybe things just didnt come together right which is fine i guess still definitely looking forward to season though
1,i bought two of these from a major electronics retailer to make sure i dont get a bootleg one and they both crapped out on me i usually buy from amazon but i needed them rig away so unless that company has bought a large batch of bootleg cards or maybe im retarded i bought them from the same store but different locations i have switched brands now not taking anymore chances just in case a flood of bootleg ones hit the retail chains too it worked fine at first but as the card filled up both times both times they died and my pc or phone couldnt reformat it or recognize it good luck if you buy this major name brand i thought they were the best too but not for me i guess
1,i faced this item issues like battery drain old laptop previous activate hardware all part old almost one year old sometimes black screen blink quality too bad experience for its too embarrassing for flipkart customer or seller ratting o
1,i tried this blouse on and loved the style comfort and color of the peach so much that i was preparing to buy it when i pulled the sleeve the fabric came away from the cuff i tested another spot pulling only gently and the same thing happened too bad since the color would have been a great addition for me buti also tried the blue and it gets stars as the fabric is much better it too is adorable soft and did not tear on gentle testing the two blouse colors are made from different
1,i had such high hopes for this top the colors the peplum the ruffles the price point the fit was terrible unflattering and laughable please try again with this one retailer you could have a real winner with a little tweaking
1,worst battery
1,i purchased this top in the rose and steel blue colors even though the majority of reviews says it shrinks even when you wash per the instructions i called the local retailer store first to see if it could be returned if this happened and they said yes no problem well the reviews are correct i washed just the rose colored top so i could compare it to the steel blue if it did shrink i am returning them this evening i will not take the time or spend the money to dry clean a tank it is made ve
1,im not happy on purchase to the loptop

1,taste of home use to be real recipes by real cooks this recipe is terrible its full of prepackaged fake ingredients artificial colors artificial flavors preservatives way too much salt and is very unhealthy do not feed this recipe to your family cook real food
1,for the first season it was more than enough to keep you interested and wanting more people who are new to the witcher universe specially will probably enjoy it the most however if you are familiar with source material there will be things that annoy you geralt yaskier and yen characters are done perfectly and other characters are rather good for the most part as a long time fan i had major problems with the first season ciris story in first season was bland they should have kept it for second season time jumps were confusing triss merigold character was the most disappointing character in the series for me from her looks to personality it didnt match the character we know for long i hope they improve in the second season

1,retailer consistently provides unique sophisticated and quality made clothing with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies i shop with them exclusively i suppose that i cant expect perfection from retailerbut of the timethats what i get this is that this sweater is truly awful i cannot or find it very difficult at least begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front
1,this is a great dress if you dont want to leave the house or you want the world to see your nipples
1,i was really excited for this jacket to arrive but its going back because the fabric is coated it does not drape or hang nicely at all i expected it to be boxy but it sticks out so oddly in every direction that it looks horrible im usually an xs and ordered an xs and it looks ridiculous on me

1,i am hoping that i received a defective product and that my experience is rare but this product did not work as intended i was replacing another g micro sd card thinking that because this is a class rated product it would be faster it never worked correctly it kept dismounting unexpectedly losing data and was just not worth the money at all i ended up using my slower rated product which has worked reliably since the day i bought it i only wish this product had done the same
1,this jumpsuit looked so great on the model and looked so hideous on me im and in great shape and this jumpsuit looked absolutely ridiculousnot to mention it rode right up my backside in the worst possible way im so disappointed

1,ive requested a replacement so ill update this review after i receive a replacement but the first card i got it could be read but every time i put it into the computer it said there were errors with it it couldnt repair the errors i couldnt even format it using a command prompt to try and get it to work i could create folders on the card but not put anything into them or onto the card other than folders i tried many many things and nothing worked i know sandisk makes decent products so i will change the review later
1,i ordered this in a size which i thought would be a small and it was very very wide it is very short too i typically wear a small and am and lbs its going back unfortunately very soft material though
1,not good but average
1,i ordered these along with the regular ag stevie jeans and there is a definite difference in fabiric and cut i liked the darker fabric but it was thinner and stretchier that the more denim version the cut was also looser in the thigh and seat area which made for a looser less flattering fit returned it and kept the regular ag stevie
1,this felt like it was watered down and wasnt closed when i received it in fact this like is a really poor product do not buy
1,was really excited for this dress and couldnt be more disappointed doesnt look anything like the pictures the fabric feelscheap it came wadded up in a ball and is a wrinkled mess looking beyond that i tried it on and thought i had put it on incorrectly unfortunately not the top half doesnt sit correctly its so bizarre that it seems like a flaw in the design it doesnt sit on your shoulders but doesnt look right off your shoulders the neckline is very high also front b
1,totally bummed the pretty print doesnt outweigh the very odd fit of this dress makes you look really top heavy and even the print which looks so cute online looks muddled in person sadly went right back
1,the product is after times used capput no sound left
1,i really enjoyed this series and it sufficiently held my attention i was guessing the entire season as to who the monster was not until episode did i have it figured out jenna ortega was a fantastic wednesday and i feel like she captured the character splendidly i also love gwendoline christie as principle weems danny elfman does it again with the music in the series he is masterful loved christina riccis character and thought it was a great touch to have her in the cast i also really like the supporting cast of students thing was also done very well i hated the entire casting of the family perhaps its from preconceived notions in the previous actors of these roles the chemistry between gomez and morticia was non existent and borderline disgusting i get that catherine zeta jones is aging but it doesnt help when they cake on so much makeup it makes her look older her acting is stiff and she just didnt pull it off all i can see when gomez is on screen was his character in the movie waiting he was gross in that movie and is gross in this series uncle fester is way wrong again i have christopher lloyds portrayal in my head as a creepy mysterious uncle this one just didnt fit the scenery and effects i thought were really well done to make this a fun watch that makes me look forward to another season
1,this isnt pie this is soup i dont know if the creator forgot to add a step or what but my finished product was more liquid than apple if this is grandmas recipe she must have had soft teeth recipe should be removed
1,the top i received was large really long in length pockets in the front along the seam and lots of volume in the back without any princess seams to give it shape the id s matched but thats about it returned
1,i bought these and returned them almost immediately the material looks nice but itchy and heavy the fit is too small and just uncomfortable to wear
1,dress looks beautiful but the fitting is very off i ordered a size which is the dress size i usually wear im and lbs the chest area fits perfectly but the hip area is extremely tight and the lower back area was lose i exchanged it for a the hip area was a bit tight and the shoulders were too lose if i ordered the p i have a feeling it would be too tight it feels like its meant for someone with very small hips and a large abdomen also this dress is very stiff cant d

1,this shirt looks nothing like the fit in the pictures it is short and very wide i had read the previous reviews and thought i could take it in on the sides some but it is literally the shape of a trapezoid
1,i really dont get it why this show is so high rated i get it good visuals quite an imagination but the acting and the plot are really underwhelming is it all because of baby yoda yeah its cute and all but still not enough to make the show i struggled to watch it but wanted to like it after all the positive reviews what am i missing watching episodes again and likening them less and less such a bad movie overall bad acting bad plot baddish dialogue is it only the visuals that people fall for i really dont get it why this show is so high rated i get it good visuals quite an imagination but the acting and the plot are really underwhelming is it all because of baby yoda yeah its cute and all but still not enough to make the show i struggled to watch it but wanted to like it after all the positive reviews what am i missing
1,visions of sartorial splendor danced in my head as i planned my instagram posts centered around this coat and then it showed up on my door and my dreams were crushed id already read the reviews and knew the coat was unlined and would be oversized i did not expect it to be soooo sloppy especially around the collar there is nothing crisp about it ive had boiled wool outer ware before that held its shape much better than this if i wanted fleece i wouldnt have picked retailer as the s
1,acquired this card a month ago for use in my phone samsung galaxy s and only have taken issues with itthe micro sd card is really bad the camera takes a long time to be ready and repeatedly resets the phone absolutely not recommend it in my previous phone s used a micro sd card gb samsung brand and never had problems with itto correct the problem of instability recommend formatting the card i did and the problem remains the samelive outside the us and i must acquire excellent quality products because the cost of returning it exceeds the cost of the productnext time buy a card samsung brand that never gave me problems
1,great casting and excellent action when it actually occurs more holes in script than a swiss cheese factory to the point that its extremely distracting the analysing of people without any basis the walking to peoples houses without having been there before the ft lads giving him a proper fight it really does go on and on its so weak the writing and lack of background
1,first seasons original shocking gripping but was slightly annoyed at the use of the slow camera motion into roses face it became less of i wonder what she is planning to please lets not waste seconds more of airtime by being able to count her freckles alas the problem persists coupled with some incredibly unrealistic additional writing once the content from the original books had been exhausted rose lead character turned into a tefloncoated superhero with remarkable levels of bravery and determination not seen since arnie made strides against a whole militia in commando elizabeth moss performance is overshadowed now by some of the supporting cast not least ann dowd who i seemed to have more sympathy for than any other character its one of those shows that makes me think ive done all the seasons so far i should watch the last one rather than really wanting to
1,poor battery backup dont buy it
1,picked this up on sale doesnt work only shows up as a mb yes megabyte card that i cand do anything with i already threw away the original packaging too im sure returning it is going to be a huge pita because of thatupdate after writing this albeit short review i found this is not uncommon i also found that this card was deliberately crippled despite the product description saying the sandisk ultra microsdxc uhsi card works with any microsdxc compatible device that was all the motivation i needed to process a return on it rather than having it replaced
1,display complaint
1,not much to say this is pure starwars havent looked forward to or enjoyed watching a show this much for so long simply amazing it hits the sweet spot which makes the original star wars films so magical which other shows and films failed to hit love it keep them coming please dont change a thing
1,the fit on this shirt is bizarreit very much resembles a nursing top but wouldnt actually work for that purpose the side visible in the picture is nicely draped but the other side can flap open and is completely different i tried two different sizes and both were equally unfortunate
1,dont purchase waste of money
1,i have been looking for a nice white tunic and i should have known when i saw this was one size fits all maybe because i am petite but there was so much material hanging everywhere that it made me look even shorter and fat who wants that so sending it back
1,so bad product its key board are useless not working good
1,cant get the other to play sounds for more than a few seconds nothing in the instruction manual addresses this so i dont know if ours is faulty or what really quite upset and disappointed

1,in a nutshell season were awesome season not so much stick to the material and maybe just maybe the show can be saved the books were great why did you get away from the real story now you lost henry cavill who is the witcher and nobody can save this show and keep its fans without him you knew he was disappointed with now sticking to the source materials and you didnt listen this is going to be another netflix series that doesnt go the distance because of lazy poor writing and decisions apparently unless its a movie you just dont do the write thing for the fans of the shows
1,i bought this card originally for my galaxy note ii with the intentions of using it as my primary downloader but i could not get it to format correctly for the phone even using third party format softwarei then tried it in my galaxy tab plussame problemsi finally and ridiculously put the card in my nikon d camera i could take a whopping k photos on highlarge settings not that i would ever need to take that many photos in one session this was the last option i had to use the cardit worked well taking photos of a holiday and thankfully it did not fail before i could get my photos onto a computer since then i have inserted it back in the camera and reformatted like you always should and bam one photo is good after that failure every single time so now i have a gb card that is capable of taking and storing one photo at a time before i must run a fix file system on my computerdont waste your money on this card over priced not really faster than the other cards i have and zero longevity this may be a one off but i think it is a problem created by the proprietary format exfat that makes this card a loser or more to the point the poor customer who buys itupdate july after contacting sandisk they have offered an rma but first they must verify that i have not tried to recover or wipe the data on the card and i must ship it at my expense to taiwan i have since emailed them in reply to the requested information date of purchase photos of the card packaging ect and i told them that the data on their is my data and if i could have accessed the card i would have wiped it why should i give them my information stored on the card that makes me less than happy i am guessing that they want to discourage returns who would want to send data to a company not knowing who will access it and what they will do with the information contained i would have wiped the card but it was unreadable unable to format unable to do anything i will send it to them hoping that the information is destroyed along with the bad cardsandisk you are asking a whole lot of your customers and since this card has gone bad i have had several other cards from them go bad as well seems to be a whole lot of cards being shipped that die in very short time periods i used to love their products and their older flash drives are great still using a micro cruzer that is years old and going strong i have not had one single microsd card from this company last more than three months since i moved to the philippines either they send their junk to the philippines or they have dropped qc from their business model to create higher profit marginsupdate after emailing sandisk and expressing my displeasure with having to return the item intact so that they can assess the card and look atrecover what ever personal information may have been stored on the card they rescinded i can only assume that they want to get the card back to verify that it is bad or make sure that you are not just trying to get a free card out of them which i can understand instead of requiring me to send the card back to them they asked that i cut the card and send a photo of the destroyed card so they could process a new card to be sent to me directly in the philippines i hammered them pretty hard in this review and in the email i sent to them regarding the bad card and sometimes you get results in this case i give them stars for doing the right thing i had no problem cutting the card since it would not operate in any of my devices anyway but i did have a problem returning the device intact with out knowing what information was stored on the card banking amazon account info passwords ect i would have just kept the card destroyed it and never bought another from sandisk with their faith restoring gesture i will not remove them from my list of companies to avoid i just hope that they get better at qc i returned another defective card to the retailer yesterday only to find out that you must have the original packaging for a replacement i was lucky to still have one of my packages but since i bought several of the cards i am not sure if i gave them the matching package for the card i returnedi would suggest that if you are like me and have several devices dslrs galaxy tab galaxy note sii lgp that you find a way to mark each cardpackage and keep the package in the case that the card should go bad i have had more than half of my sandisk gb cards fail on me in less than months i only buy them because of the cards available in my area these are the best which is scary with such a high failure rate
1,item i ordered was gb it listed it on the card but this was tested and at most was gb and very oldi would steer far away from sandisk sold online unless it is in original packagingi returned it for a full refund and reordered and oem gb card from samsung
1,laptop are available in the box only full of newspapers and in central a big stone are placed
1,poor
1,too tight in strange ways beautiful dress i was so excited to receive it however it just did not fit
1,my pie did not turn out as expected was very disappointed ive gone over the recipe many times as i was sure it was something i did wrong but i just cant figure out what it was i made of these pies for christmas and had to throw them both away i read the reviews and the caramel sauce is supposed to sink to the bottom but how does sauce with eggs in it sink it turned out like terrible caramel scrambled eggs on top ive baked before and really cant figure out how everyone else can make it come out right but mine was so terrible we couldnt eat it
1,something in this recipe is way off with the ingredients my bread was not all all the correct mix of ingredients
1,waste of money dont buy
1,the recommended amount does not refresh the fabric and similar amount to the normal one needs to be used lucky if you get washes from it
1,i for some reason was never a fan of the adams family i dont know why but none of the shows or previous movies appealed to me so i just kind of avoided them this one was getting so much hype from social media i wanted to see what the fuss was about so i reluctantly tuned into the first episode next thing i know i am finished the whole season i think the really appealing thing for me wasnt so much the characters as it was the mystery that needed to be solved the characters did help and the setting was interesting it was a bit predictable nearer the end which was ok because for most of it you are left asking what is going on who did it it also resolved nicely so if they go onto season i hope they are their own contained stories in the sense that you dont need to watch season to understand
1,iam disappointed
1,i own some pure and good cotton tanks similar to this in black that i live in teaching dance i was hoping these would be the same i ordered the pale blue and it is completely see through and fits tight in the back and loose in the front i have no desire to have a brasports bra show whether out the sides or through the fabric it is tacky
1,lame af remember when shows had to be funny to be successful and now just have to have some actors that were famous a bunch of years ago
1,dont buy these product green line on display within days
1,i ordered a size in the orange it ran a size smaller than normal size maeve tops the quality of the material was terrible it wrinkled and was also so thin that you need to wear a tank underneath that messes with the look of the lace on the top the color of the orange was gorgeous
1,if this was any more worthless it would have a retched stench this card has completely turned me away from ever trusting another sandisk product again i would only use this in the future to keep corrupt misinformation to frustrate anyone attempting to acquire any of my datai have reformatted it times in full using various allocation sizes and operating systems it only functions under windows it randomly works in my mobile devices now im left to decide if i want to bother researching this to better understand the problem in the future or simply purchase another card from a more reliable manufacturer hello kingston
1,very disappointed ordered two sizes the fraying of the embroidery was so bad on one of the dresses i wouldnt have worn it and the zipper was sticking the second dress had fraying and loose threads as well and the seams at the shoulders were not properly sewn which made the lace at the neckline completely crooked some of these issues would maybe be acceptable if the dress was under but at they are not returning both sizes
1,very bad product dont buy no service centre they are make fool every costomer
1,as the title says the card i got is defective and faulty the issue is the sd card always unmounts and then remounts and sometimes it will says the the sd card is corrupted and needs to be formatted so first i tried to format it using my cellphone xperia play copied all my files again to the sd card and it gave me the same error tried other phones inspire g and samsung galaxy s still same error then i tried to take it out and put it in my computer and manually format and check for bad sectors and fix errors and it will not finish and says cannot continue because sd card is corrupted i searched google and find out the sandisk have shipped a bad batch of sd cards so i contacted the company and demanded for a return because its past due to return it through amazon got rmaed and already shipped it and i do not know how long will it take to for them to send me another sd card so now i do now have any sd card to put my files because of this situations that couldve avoided if sandisks qa department is not slacking off very disappointed customer
1,dont buy this laptop
1,this was totally gross all i could taste was salt and i love salt will go back to my original receipe wanted to try something new and wish i hadnt
1,worst show i have ever seen hated every single person on the show besides belinda if u want to be annoyed and watch a bunch of people you hate watch this
1,four out of four adults in this family did not care for this at all it was too rich and greasy with all the cheese
1,it is really really cringy no good humor boring and really bad dialogues the only good thing about this series is how fast you can skip through the episodes
1,dont buy anyone because it has incarry warranty u cant get the laptop issues fixed at your home all d time u have to visit at their service centers to fix this laptop issues and all these process takes almost full month to get it done so better is to away from this laptop and buy d laptop which has domestic warranty
1,im a coeliac and intolerant to cows milk and have a huge sweet tooth ive found some amazing vegan ice cream alternatives ocado sell a number of delicious ones i also love tescos gluten and dairy free cornettos however was super excited to try these especially after all the amazing reviews the tops are covered in nuts and chocolate and the cone is thick and crispy however none of these bits are quite enough to hide the awful taste of the ice cream i cant even describe it as bland as it had a flavour just an awful one it was not creamy and ice cream like it was like frozen whipped up soya milk that they removed the flavour from i enjoyed eating the chocolate and nut part and the cone and just cringed my way through the ice cream part cant understand all the rave reviews the vegan magnums however are spot on and delicious
1,bought this as it was on offer and thiught how different cojld it be from the garnier summer glow well aparently this is made to not only go stripey and make your feet orange but to make you stink of false tan moral of the story i should have bought the garnier it has a better smell and ive never had streaking from it
1,i tried this on at my local store i love the look and the color of the blue tank and wanted very much to like it alas it was not to be the material is super thin almost seethrough and it is of poor quality i did not buy it
1,battery life is very bad
1,i was so excited when i ordered this i love comfy clothing this looked perfect when i received it there was a weird smell with the top convinced that this could be from storage or something i washed it the smell did not go away i have washed it times now and the smell will not disappear i have not yet worn but as i have washed it not able to return it the top looks and feels great just the weird smell now i am stuck
1,this top was a big disappointment i ordered two of the grey motif with the print of the forest animals in size neither of them fit well but one was cut much smaller than the other ive had this problem with all of the numericallysized buttondown style of maeve tops i dont understand why in size this keeps happening thats why i purchase two of each usually one fits and the other doesnt this time unfortunately neither worked they both were too tight in the armsshoulders
1,i purchased sandisk because i thought it was the most reliable name brand out there i have a galaxy s and purchased this gb card to handle all my photos and movies id say over the last months i havent been using the storage for more than just photos and the occasional movie the device just failed on me yesterday losing all my photos and files thank goodness for dropbox autophoto upload otherwise i would of permanently lost my photosi actually went back to the amazon branded microsd card gb which is about as fast and so far way more reliable than sandisk i cant beleive a sandisk card failed im probably going to rma the unit and hope they send me a better unit you can guarantee that im going to burn in the card to make sure theres no errorsi gave it one star because you think you pay a premium for a premium product you expect it to be as near flawless as possible
1,so disappointed i love retailer this was a huge disappointment i am and pounds when i put it on all i could think was that i looked just like a clown due to the big cowl neck and how large and round the dress made me look if i wasnt so disappointed i might have laughed this had to have been a design mistake ive truly never seen something so unflattering
1,these have issues with gopro do not use the transfer speed is inaccurate and gopro has even admitted it doesnt support this
1,i processor is available but the working speed is not as per i processor
1,the customer service is very bad i bought a breville barista pro espresso machine for which is too cheap because the machines price is the thirdparty seller was a scammer he puts low prices to attract buyers he sent me a tracking number to the same city as my address but to a different address and sent a small box that fit a mailbox the machine is about pounds i called the usps and they told me that the tracking number was not to my address so walmart charged me and later they removed that seller from their site due to quality issues that means he is a scammer
1,used this micro sd card in my samsung galaxy tab was watching a video stored on the card while ago when the video quit playing and the message sorry this file cannot be played appeared on the screen checked es file explorer and found that all the apps movies music etc i had stored on the micro sd card were gone the card was apparently totally blank inserted the card in my desktop computer and the computer said that the card had to be reformatted before it could be used tried to reformat it to ntfs exfat and fat each time the computer said it was unable to complete operation guess this card is dead after a little over months
1,i followed this recipe exactly it was so blah no flavor at all i kept adding more cheese and seasonings it looked good but had no taste
1,wish i would have read the reviews before i purchased and wore two of these washed as directed and same outcome as everyone else basically unwearable unless i maybe use it for a nightshirt the shrinkage lengthwise was ridiculous glad i didnt buy every color like i had planned to do
1,note please read the last update scroll to the bottom im leaving this review as star as it appears to help others who purchased and had a similar experiencei give sandisk stars for customer service and star for the product for those manufactured in the past for those newly manufactured products that contain the software rom fix id give the product starsto all those who purchased this card due to all the great reviews and then used it in a galaxy s gs smartphone for storage the solution to the problem is not one you can solve without returning the card to sandisk for a replacement under warranty believe me i tried everything that the google searches returned as solutions formatting as exfat formatting in the gs then copying data to the card while in the phone etc nothing worked and so now please stop pulling out your hair and hopefully you will get the same result which i hope to get soon just rmad and will send it back tomorrow for a free replacement under warrantythe problem as confirmed from the sandisk customer support rep when i asked specifically asked him when used in the gs this card will unmount itself inadvertently may be true only for cards manufactured before the rom patch described below was implemented in manufacturing this can cause the data to become corrupt luckily was not my experience and or can be very frustrating as most of us are saving mp camera pictures to the card or mp movies that stop in the middle of the movie and it unmounts when you view the picture in the gallery or worse right when you take the picture this was the issue i experienced sandisk knows about this issue again sandisk knows about the issue and will replace your card call them info below and they will take care of it under warranty they have a good name for a reason and they want to keep it sorry sandisk about the star but i thought it was the way to get the message out to those searching for a solution the customer rep told me that sandisk tried to work with samsung to resolve the issue but samsung refused to acknowledge a problem exists with this card and some of their phones especially their flagship gs phones the customer rep told me that to their knowledge the card works fine in regular cameras not samsung gs phones with cameras obviously and even worked fine in some phones from htc etc that could accommodate the gb cards hence the star ratings from others the solution sandisk came up with was to write a patch into the rom of the card itself to specifically address the issue on samsung gs phones and maybe other samsung phones like the gs i was assured that the new card i would get would work flawlessly will see in about weeks i purchased my card from amazon june so the ones currently being manufactured and the one i should get will have the new patch however as sandisk manufactures in batches like most of the industry old batches of unpatched cards obviously exist in warehouses i asked about a software patch i could download and was told its not possible hence the hard coded patch in the cards romso how to take care of the problemafter speaking with the sandisk us customer support link and info below this is what i learned and didgo to the sandisk site call consumer products support this is the us no sandisk tell them that the card is unmounting itself in your gs i assume this is also a problem experienced by gs owners too they will then confirm your information approve your return min approval window by mine was basically instantaneously and then send you emails with a ups return label and instructions btw they also asked if i had a magnifying glass to id the serial no on the card but i didnt and couldnt read it myself those numbers are super small printed into the plastic dont believe me take a look yourself i told the rep i couldnt read them and he said no problem they would process without the serial no i assume this is because they send you a new replacement card only when they receive your card you send in makes sensewell thats it problem hopefully solved lets see in weeks the rep was super nice about it and seemed like they were all too familiar with the problem kudos to sandisk for taking care of it however it would be nice if there was some type of communication notice of the issue besides google info sources forums etc i spent hours maybe a couple of days total hours worth thinking it was an issue with my phone my data transfer oh well thats how it goesi really hope that this review helps some of you out there with the same problem as me good luckbtw id give the card stars if this problem was solved in the patched rom of newer cards as the data transfer speeds are awesome on the card tested transferring data via a card reader hooked to my computer if the data transfer remaining mounted in the gs issue never existed prepatch of rom of courseupdate all went well with the return of the sandisk storage card ups shipping took about days from when i sent it sandisk verified the warranty claim day later and hours later that same day my replacement card had been shipped waiting on the new card now but expect to test it out very soon early next week will update the post after testing out the new card just as a reference ive been using a gb micro sd hc sandisk card in the gs since having shipped the gb card obviously its a different card and not the micro sd xc kind other than a bit slower access speeds to the card absolutely zero problems well if you dont count that its basically filled up hence why the gb option is great on the gs so it proves the point on the problem with the early build micro sd xc gb cardsim happy to see that my review has helped some others out there good luck to you in your warranty claim my experience with sandisk customer support has been excellent so farupdate received the new replacement sandisk storage card just a few days ago shipping back to me once they agreed it was defective was a very short time window have had it running in the galaxy s for a few days now without any jumps stutters or card unloading in the middle of picture or video taking card seems to work flawlessly as the sandisk rep mentioned it would one would think its such a short time to test after a few days of use but if this were not fixed already it would have dismounted in the first minutes thats how often and how fast it was occurring so it would seem the problem is solved the new sd card makes the phone even more responsive when moving between pictures in the gallery and performing other tasks like copying files to the card thanks sandisk unless i update this review by next week you will know that the problem has been fixedgood luck to those with similar problems as we now know how to get it fixed thanks to sandisks great responsive customer serviceupdate this is the last update to this review just to close the loop the new replacement card from sandisk has been running flawlessly for about weeks now i have not experienced any of the initial problems sandisk really did fix the issues in the new batch of cardsupdate the card has been running in my gs flawlessly since replacing it around aug st pretty good track record so far months so it appears to be fixed with the newly manufactured replacement cardsfor those that have left comments that i should change the rating upwards now that the issue is fixed see my addition at the beginning of this review when searching for a solution to a problem with a purchased product most people start at the star reviews to see what others have experienced this is especially true for products with a lot of reviews this is what i did in the beginning with this product therefore i think leaving it at star and adding the comments at the beginning should clarify the reviewthanks to review commenter da shocker for his input i think he sums it up very well when it comes to the value of files stored on media like thisone more thing to those not happy with the one star rating by this person go ahead buy one take tons of pics vids and save some music on there then when the card crashes come back and give it a five star a card cost pictures from a vacation or family event are priceless
1,worst exp
1,i love the way these shorts fit and look very comfy but after laundering one time the lavender color became blotchy used regular detergent in gentle cycle and it looks like someone poured bleach on them in random areas they are unwearable i have several colors but the only color that was a problem is the lavender for one wear was a waste i hate to leave negative feedback but be careful with laundering
1,as the other reviewer said the skirt had this weird bunching on both sides of the hipsit was ridiculous i dont know how anyone could wear itlooks like you had two little triangle things poking out from each hip im long and lean so usually skirts like this fit me well very very strangely constructedi couldnt keep it even at the deeply discounted price
1,this laptop is money waste because you start laptop after and minutes very heat laptop
1,i love dystopia i really do and im enjoying this series i cant help but feel though there is this giant plot hole right in the middle and it starts with the republic of gilead these people are really weird theyre like a cult yet the show never really explains how a crazy cult took over yes this world has fertility and contamination problems but hard times do not necessarily create huge cults in fact most cults happen through brainwashing but thats not what the flashbacks show for instance nick decided to join the weird ones because he was having trouble finding a job really the cult bigwigs decided to have the strange sex ceremony with their handmaids because they were afraid that it would upset their wives if they didnt include them are you serious unless youre a psychopath it takes a lot to go in and kill unarmed people hanging their bodies in a church in the beginning it shows aunt lydia brainwashing the handmaids but in reality shes doing a crappy job because i have yet to see a handmaid that truly embraces her lot in life except maybe crazy janine not to mention youd think that cult members would be a lot more fanatical then what is portrayed i always think of cult members as having a devout religious fervor or an absolute total belief in their doctrine and leaders after all during the witch trials huge swathes of people truly believed in witches however in the show most of the characters dont appear to truly believe what they are saying maybe its the actors but because of this the bad guys just seem like weird autocratic despots who murder torture and subjugate their people like all dictators wheres the outrage that started this cult mentality the show mostly focuses on the suffering of the handmaids and doesnt really explain the shift in point of view in fact the show just takes it for granted that religious fundamentalists will automatically go out and slaughter people if contamination and fertility problems occur and that all kinds of people will hop on board to support them seriously i also keep thinking there should be a cult bigwig like jim jones reverend moon or big brother dont cults need a savior and who are all these men with guns who go around shooting and hanging people gilead is very well armed but how did they get that way i guess all these men are all supposed to be as stupid as nick in orwell showed how people could become brainwashed fanatics and accept that so far the handmaids tale has not shown this consequently it doesnt really make sense and it fails to be a truly prophetic and thought provoking dystopia im still enjoying it though im one of those that usually gives a lot of leeway to television and movies as long as theyre entertaining
1,not even a single function working properly
1,the print is very pretty but the fabric is stiff and it runs way too big looks great on the model but awful on me
1,it failed it only worked monthsi used it in a galaxy s phone it seems that this brand has an issue with this modeli lost the information
1,so theres nothing to watch at the moment bc were all waiting for succession to come back in so were watching this until then but its honestly like watch a bunch of boring vacations with very few sprinkles of dry humor any rating over six is just excite to watch a new show

1,since i discovered this smell i have never changed but i got it in my shopping this week and its a different smellnot the same which is a shame as it was my favourite it does say new fragrance blend on itif it aint broke dont fix it
1,this show seems to have found the magic that the walking dead twd had for seven straight seasons when it reached its peak viewership of million viewers im amazed that the zombie genre can still attract a major audience since twd debuted in there have been more than zombie movies and series in shows like these quality is everything here the acting production values and most of the writing is pretty good ive never played the game so im rating it purely on its own merits i think the big challenges for the series will be to keep the pacing brisk and stories moving forward both of which plagued twd as it aged are they ever going to reach their destination is it going to be what they were hoping will we ever see humanity being saved will they move around the timeline or last of us universe or game versions who knows whats planned but hopefully theyll see the challenges of twd and do something different but for now if youre into postapocalyptic zombie adventures or even just good scifi adventure shows this ones for you
1,touch pad not working very bad product dont west money
1,these pants are gorgeous when you first see them they fit beautifully when you first put them on and then you wear them for one day and they snag on everything and little strings start to come out of the pants and the hem begins to unravel and the pants which were once beautiful light summer pants appropriate for work or brunch are now frumpy worn out pants with a million snags and strings hanging off of them after one day i cant begin to tell you how annoyed i am that i spent
1,very bad product quality battery drain fast
1,i tried this dress on in an xs petite the dress runs slightly bigger it sort of looked like a tent on me whereas other xs p dresses at retailer fit tts the other thing is that the dress just doesnt look like an almost dress the band that runs across the bust goes under the arms too it isnt sewn in though and it was folding down under the arms making it look like its ripping off the collar too seemed to pull down right in the center as if the material was too heavy to stand its we
1,dress is much different in person thin ribbed cotton a little tight for xl it looks like a throw back dress from contempos returned and would not recommend
1,you gotta watch this show with the right mood only then you will be able to enjoy the ride but have your expectations low so you dont get disappointed with the final result the best aspect of the show is that it neither pushes progressive or traditional values the show makes fun of both spectrums but of course being a modern show it checks the usual boxes and has a lot of queer baititing characters but it doesnt affect the quality the worst part of the show was in the nd season the amount of time wasted with the italian characters completely unnecessary and theyre all very bad actresses unfortunately i was cringing the whole time i believe many people gave up watching the show because of those parts but the rest of the show is pretty decent and the american actors are good very good hopefully the rd season has less fillers and rises the overall quality
1,i so wanted to love this suit it was gorgeous the color the quality the style but i am returning and can not recommend it the sides need to be connected just a little bit higher and i think it would work but there is no way you could move around in this without things popping out in front i mean it would be gorgeous to just lay there in the sun but i didnt feel like i could even walk safely and i am not wellendowed very bummed but its going back
1,having never heard of this show prior to seeing it on netflix i must say i was quite intrigued right off the bat with a rather unusual name it stuck out like a sore thumb in my recommended section after finishing the first season i immediately watched all episodes again now that ive finished it twice i can easily say this is one of the best shows on british tv currently and can stand toetotoe with anything hbo or showtime has to offer peaky blinders touches on a relatively unknown and fascinating portion of british history and is supported by some of the finest acting i have ever seen on tv let me preface this by saying i am an american living in the midwest so the subject material in this show is something i never knew existed peaky blinders takes place in post ww birmingham which is a time and place i cant say i was very familiar with prior to watching this show following a street gang who runs various racketeering and gambling enterprises called the peaky blinders the show unfolds as a northern irish detective sam neill comes to birmingham to sort out a case of stolen machine guns things immediately start off with a bang and rarely let up throughout the hour show cillian murphy plays the stoic admirable leader of the peaky blinders tommy shelby and is easily one of the most likable antiheroes i have seen both in tv and film his character is smart savvy and equally ruthless and despite all this you find yourself rooting for him throughout the show this is a phenomenon similar to that of the sopranos tony soprano that is no matter how many terrible things these characters do we always find ourselves championing them and hoping for their success knight does a fantastic job humanizing these largerthanlife characters making them relatable to the everyday person next ill touch on the acting sam neill and cillian murphy easily steal the show here making both their characters incredibly fun to watch neill does a fine job with his northern irish accent and while not entirely perfect it gets the job done cillian murphy on the other hand nearly knocks the very difficult to impersonate brummie accent out of the park while not perfect it is definitely believable for someone who isnt from the midlands seriously though this guy can do accents better than almost any actor ive seen the supporting cast does a great job as well and paul andersons arthur shelby is easily my second favorite character honorable mention goes to helen mccroys polly shelby who brings some muchneeded pragmatism to the table apart from the fine writing and acting peaky blinders also has some pretty incredible set pieces as well birmingham is well portrayed as the industrial giant it was after the war and throughout the show you see some period sets that will blow your mind from narrow cobblestone streets to steel mills shooting fire into the streets you really get a feel for what this time may have been like from my understanding birmingham has been leveled since ww either by bombs or city planning so there was some artistic interpretation as to how the city would look despite this the show does a tremendous job building the city from the ground up and making it seem believable for me this brought the time period to life and gave me some insight on what the city may have been like in in peaky blinders birmingham is a character itself which adds a rather interesting backdrop for the actors to work in if you are a fan of crime dramas you should definitely give this show a watch it has quietly become one of my favorite tv shows of all time my only complaint is that there arent enough episodes per season update season was just released in the states on netflix and i had the pleasure of binging it in two days peaky blinders is still a fantastic show even with a slight dropoff in season in my opinion season came back much stronger though and i give knight a lot of credit for keeping this show alive and interesting across all these arcing seasons without giving anything away i must say that adrien brody did a fantastic job in season as the primary antagonist which is something i thought season lacked this show is still topnotch and cillian murphy continues to impress with his acting ability as the nefarious tommy shelby if you havent watched this show yet or perhaps havent completely followed along do so by the order of the peaky blinders
1,bought two of these because i loved the way they fit off of the rack washed them according to directions and they were ruined the material shrank up making the shirt short and boxy and the side panels ended up being rippled definitely going to try to return these
1,i ordered the taupe version of this tee which was a medium brown with black stripes the fabric felt itchy and rough and was pretty sheer for not being light colored i didnt care for the fit which was extremely boxy and wide from the picture i expected an aline fit but not a wide drop with webbed underarms i ordered sizes and could have worn the smaller if id kept this tee it runs on the larger side what astounded me most was that both tees i ordered were sewn with completely cro
1,lil cheddar meat loaves skip the sickeningly sweet topping the mini loaf idea was very good but will use my own meatloaf recipe which has alot more flavor
1,this is a chines product i purchased it o th sep within month it is not working
1,the white lotus created and directed by mike white are a superb series one the best watched lately as the story unfolds calmly we wonder what will happen in the end if you want to relax and enjoy your time watching a good show this series is for you the cast is fantastic and handpicked especially the young cast like sydney sweeney who shines here im a great admirer of the actor steve zahn since mad dogs and once again shows how versatile he can be also murray bartlett is superb and brilliant in his role hbo adds another fantastic series in his long list my rating
1,i bought of those sandisk gb microsd used them on my galaxy note and galaxy sfirst one my phone started saying it was removed then recognize it again then diedi thought its just a luck plugged in the nd one stayed for about months and died suddenly and lost everythingnever buying from sandisk again ever
1,cut out design no seems or hems very disappointed in retailer
1,thought id try this spray im sorry to say it leaves streaks all over the kitchen surfaces again and again ive used many cif products before all with great results but this one is terrible
1,i live in thailand and am having a real hard time believing this season is filmed there there are numerous very obvious errors throughout the series so far and its only episode for one thing no one greets anyone by saying swastika its sow what dee khrap for men or sow what dee ka for women not swastika the first time i heard it i thought is was a mistake and then a different character says the same thing later in the show for another thing no thai resort has that many foreign staff and definitely not in jobs reserved specifially for thais for example foreigners are not allowed to work as masseuses despite what is shown in the show and even the thais in the show arent greeting each other the way literally every other thai in the country does literally every thai greets every other thai with a wai hands clasped together fingertips at about nose level for friendsfamily higher for people like doctors or govt officials and higher still for monks or really high up people but in the show thai people are not doing that sheesh even foreigners that live or work here know better and the islands they tour around on the boat are in a completely different area over kms straight line across the kra isthmus that separates the gulf of thailand and koh samui from phuket in the andaman sea cant wait to see how many more obvious errors they make in the next couple of episodes oh yeah there are no monkeys on koh samui apparently the production crew brought them to the island and left them there
1,getting extremely warm the cooling fan having heavy noise only a good looking design is a positive that i feel poor performance never ever recommend to anybody battery back up is only hrs maximum
1,i like a shorter jacket but this one was poorly made and poorly fit the sleeves were way too tight im a size or and the large which would be a had tight sleeves that wrinkled up my arms and the hem of the sleeve turned inside out i ordered both a medium size and a large size and neither hung right the m too tight and the large too loose in the body and too tight in the sleeves very polyester with lots of static cute idea but not very good in pe
1,this series is a highquality blend of mystery crime and action overall the plot and complexity are wellexecuted and engaging the character dynamics particularly reachers ability to extract excellent clues from fine details are enjoyable and reminiscent of sherlock however the last scenes before the final part and the ending scenes of the final part are disappointingly predictable compared to the rest of the show additionally some of the visual effects are overly simplistic and fail to impress despite these shortcomings there are no major coherence issues to detract from the overall experience with improvements made to the predictable plot points and the visual effects particularly the explosion scenes this series could achieve a perfect rating the predictable parts make it feel more like a generic action series and therefore my rating is
1,laptop performance nice but design is thirdclass hot fan venting is screen side so screen heat too much during game also charger is very big so overall rating
1,too slow and not very exciting stories some of the characters were interesting and the rich mum was probably the most entertaining but most of the episodes were incredibly slow and unlike previous seasons you werent on edge anxious about what was going to happen next the story about the security guard felt completely unbelievable since a five star hotel in those countries takes security a lot more seriously and then nothing came out of that story in the end the three american girls was probably the most entertaining part of the series because it could be real the music was not as good as previous seasons
1,retailer has incredible service and so they let me return this dress even after having worn it however this dress cannot be cleaned i saw a stain on it after the first use so i first tried hand washing it however the black part of the dress came off on the white part making the stain worse i then tried dry cleaning it the care tag allows both and that produced or new stains where the black rubbed off on the white its a beautiful striking dress that would be great maternit
1,battery level so bad
1,i wanted this jacket to fit on me like in the photo but i guess my frame was still to petite the fabric was also on the cheap end
1,i bought the slumber otter in march and it doesnt work properly anymore it stops after seconds
1,didnt like the dress look pregnant in it this dress is going back
1,an awful dress retailer why didnt you post my last review i would not even give it a quarter of a star
1,terrible fit for a longer torso runs small in hip and lining huge in the waist not good for an hourglass figure
1,i hoped wednedsay to be good but it turned out to be much more than that ie an absolute watch coming to the story it is suspenseful and gripping and many a times it feels like harry potter because of the school magic and solving a mystery due to which this feels a little predictable still it turns on sound to be different from it because of wednesday herself the performances are great by the whole team and many of the actors we have seen before and their experience is enormous but wednesday shines above all due to her mean attitude mean expression mean caring dialogues mean cute dialogues and mean what not dialogues which surely make us laugh i have seen jenna ortega in a movie previously named x where she played a role of a very simple girl and in wednesday she felt like a new version of herself and by this we can know what she can do ahead after wednesday the character which i liked the most was the thing which made us awed did by just hand signals wednesdays roomate enid was cute and funny too the cgi in wednesday looks perfect may it be the landscapes animals fire or the background it lifts up the show overall you can enjoy wednesday with your family and have fun with wednesdays mean attitude and her journey of solving the mystery
1,not good aptop
1,battery health is very low i use for minutes charge is lass by percent

1,i wanted to love this dress because the fabric is fun but i could not find a way to make the drawstring waist look like anything but a potato sackthe model has her hands hiding the lack of a waistline
1,only works for seconds at a time terrible
1,so bad the corn starch makes it extremely gluey and gross and is completely unnecessary all you need is the butter chopped into the flour to make the crisp topping work this tastes like something from dennys thats not a compliment
1,very bad no access for leptop display in not hd
1,ordered this from amazon and was expecting it to work perfectly like my other gb sandisk in my galaxy s however i was really disappointed that upon placing it in my note edition the card become unrecognizable i tried reformatting on the computer on the phone and yet no prevail it could be the firmware or current update of android but the point is that if other companies can make a card that works why not do the same maybe i got a bad batch who knowsi went ahead and ordered the gskill microsd card and now its working perfectly im s
1,it seemed to stay in place and did not require constant readjustment however i found the band to be extremely small and tight it is not the most comfortable bra because of the way the band just presses into your skin
1,my suggestion is plz avoid buying this laptop because flip of this laptops will not go more than degree which creates difficulties while sitting in different position and different body height of user
1,i thought that the batter was deliciouse but the final product had a flour taste that was not very good the frosting was also disappointing
1,i love so many of the recipes posted on taste of home but this is not one i would give it a on taste test but the biggest problem is what the slow cooker does to the noodles the noodles are so overcooked you cannot hardly tell what is sauce and what is noodle i like a firmer noodle i also cut the cooking time down an hour but still no better did anyone else have this problem i might try it again but cook in the oven
1,i usually use secret which is the best by a country mile out of many many anti perspirants ive tried over many years added this to my pantry order just to get free delivery but wow its rubbish hrs after using and i start feeling wet and sticky under the arms and thats after a fairly sedentary day cant recommend at all one of the worst ive tried one star for the lovely smell though even if its a little strong for me back to secret for me
1,so im barely wrapping up season and maybe my rating will change after viewing season three but can someone tell me why nearly all of the female characters are insufferable i understand jennifer coolidges character is meant to be obnoxious but sometimes it was just too much season alexandra daddarios character was so agitating was she supposed to be a parody of a privileged out of touch white woman who was desperate to be marginalized season wasnt as bad the men were more obnoxious but it all made sense for what they were trying to convey season is where every female character was awful and writtendirected to be airheads with little to no communication skills and it was taking me out of the story so much stuttering blank bug eyed stares ignorant decisions made and overall adolescent behaviors for women who are in their late s and up oddly enough the prostitutes and meghann fahys character were the only women written as well rounded adults who chose their paths im just not someone who enjoys watching grown women be infantilized porshas character was extremely obnoxious as well but i suppose she received her karma in the end it just left me puzzled with what the takeaway was supposed to be from season was it that money doesnt buy integrity or brains was it that rich people are weirdos was it that rich people are just as degenerate as everyday folks or was it just a microscope on the lives of some rich people at a bougie hotel regardless of what the end goal was with the story it left a lot to be desired in terms of closure and clarity so far i prefer season bc the storylines had clearer points of view while season was muddy due to the strange way a lot of the characters were written i found myself too annoyed by majority of the characters to get engrossed in whatever stories were being told ill see how i truly feel about the series as a whole after i finish season but i cant stress enough how irritating and insufferable it was to see a bunch of adults unable to string a sentence together or be straightforward to move the story along it made everything so stale and dragged
1,but then again so is the book and its main character as everyone knows jack reacher is such a fantastical character that he couldnt possibly live in the real world the creators have realised this too and decided that they wouldnt bother with changing the tone of the books and to keep it set it in its fantasy world and to their credit thats what makes this work ritchson is well cast and grows into the role after a bit of a wooden start in the first few episodes goodwin as finlay and fitzgerald as roscoe ably assist as do just about all the rest of the cast the production team did a great job and some of the sets felt like they were picked straight out of my head its ridiculous and ludicrous but it also moves along at a clip and is wholly entertaining throughout its a pretty decent first season and will only improve as it goes on i think well worth a look if you dont want something too serious and just want to be entertained its a good watch
1,virtually impossible to single out one particular performance from this ensemble cast murray bartlett increasingly unhinged resort manager and jennifer coolidge permanently unhinged are incredible natasha rothwell steve zahn connie britton and most of the cast breathe life into mike whites hilarious satire of contemporary consumerist society no spoilers as i wont ruin it for you as there are a few quite novel and shocking scenes the build up to the dénouement is exquisitely delivered week after week a few of the minor characters were two dimensional eg olivia and paula and werent sufficiently interesting enough although understandably included as devices for cultural commentary i wouldve liked their screen time to have been used on richer character development elsewhere format of the show promises future delights as a new cast will appear in season at another luxury location
1,good show in the beginning had a real star wars feel it was fun now the execs at disney are getting to favoreau these stories are turning into ridiculous disney crap againsorry guys i really liked this show heres why the characters are becoming silly laughable representations of themselves the story is becoming a jokesmells of the other laughable spinoffs like fett and kenobi grogu painfullyis just a novelty nowdont get me wrong i love the little guy but crap disney the direction youve gone with him ridiculous moff gideon may be the worst acted character in star wars worse than jar jar the guy has no charisma and is not awe inspiring in the least like star wars baddiesie darth vader if i was mando and he was revealing his bad guy plans to me id laugh in his face just woefully pitiful where did disney find this guy get some acting lessons bud all i can say is wow disney screw up another franchise thats what you docould you show any less care for a show that started out good yesand you will run it into the ground disney if you start the show stop after season the rest is ridiculousits better never to learn more about the central characters and important plot points it will disappoint you thanks
1,what a let down the sweater i received in no way resembles the product pictured based on the original price point i envisioned a beautiful handknitted sweater made of high grade yarn wool that i could use for travel instead i received something that is grossly oversized for xss made out of weird crafting yarn and looks like an ugly holiday sweater my kids could make something better than this on their toy loom not the quality i expected from retailer back it goes

1,i love this outfit so much and bought the skirt pictured with the top on the model in high hopes my quest for the perfect date night outfit would be ended not so for starters the top is much more of a beige in person a horrible unflattering color that few can get away with successfully secondly there is just so much fabric it billows and bunches all over the place to wear it out like that as shown would be silly and to tuck it in looks like ive tried to hard to make it work lastly the
1,i purchased these pants on as a more fashionable alternative to yoga pants while traveling southeast asia starting february after about wears with little washing in between as i was backpacker style traveling the pants wore through in between my legs the fabric first started to develop little fuzz balls everywhere and then literally disintegrated in places i tried to sew them to continue wearing them while traveling but alas the fabric had become so thin that the thread could

1,this is a cute top but i wore it for around hours and lo and behold i had smurf skin i did not sweat in it but the color transferred to my underarm area and bra and it did not come off in the shower i guess its going to have to wear off thank goodness it was not a hot day i hope that i can return it
1,first season is the reacher ive been waiting for uncompromising brilliant a lone wolf the mystery is cracking the support cast are all excellent its a solid out of ten but then i watched season oh boy suddenly reacher is a team player hes surrounded by generic characters played by actors with the most forgettable faces and bland alpha performances hes not as brilliant as the female lead nope in fact hes now doing dumb things but theres a violent fight every episode so i guess if you like reacher beats up the bullies scenes then youll enjoy it i couldnt even get through episode one season two is that much of a drop in quality what happened
1,so disappointed lots of work beautiful resultsvery bland in taste
1,i ordered a size smaller prr other reviewers but that still didnt prepare me for the sweaters issues it looks really cute but the quality is pretty horrendous i wore it for the first time today and already the sweater is pilling a lot on my back seriously heartbroken
1,this blouse is stunning on the website however it is totally sheer which you cannot tell from the photo i was very disappointed and will be returning
1,this top is beautiful online and in person i am in no way a large full figured gal but i did order an xl reading the past review and wanting an airy fit i ordered a larger size this shirt is horribly tiny in person the xl regular fit looked like an xs have no idea if this particular shirt sent to me was miss sized or what will take back other than fit the shirt is very beautiful in every way
1,i was so excited to get this dress since it look so pretty on line but unfortunately the it was horrendous on the model must have the dress tailored because it looks like a huge tent on me it was very wide bust down and made me look lbs heavier im and lbs ordered extra small and it fits bust up and arms so i say its tts up top
1,i had this for my smart phone and it kept dismounting itself i did some research and found out that there are others experiencing the same problem so i returned this and got transcend instead transcend works fine with no problem

1,power cable problem
1,thomas shelby makes smoking look healthy cilian murphy nailed the character
1,when the laptop is connected to the adapter to charge current is flowing from the top and front body of the laptop
1,i absolutely loved the first two seasons of the white lotus sharp witty visually stunning and packed with memorable characters and clever social commentary watching them felt like a lush sundrenched escape filled with drama humor and style but season unfortunately it lost the magic the location felt dark and heavy lacking the breezy beauty and charm of the previous seasons the tone took a grim turn and instead of an entertaining getaway it felt more like being stuck in a gloomy layover the pacing dragged the atmosphere was oppressively dramatic and the overall spark just wasnt there a disappointing detour in an otherwise brilliant journey
1,touch pad not working despite paying such a huge amount of money
1,worse laptop ever
1,hello i dont understand the waste my son has a problem she shuts down alone after a few seconds
1,loved how this draped and im super petite b bust and this was seriously one of the most ill fitting items i have every owned i purchased the pxs and it was huge i hope this has a better fit as the other reviewers seem to have a more positive review i was just appalled as to how bad the measurements were off unfortunately the straps are not adjustable so this went below my chest too sad retailer please get the fit right

1,this card does not work on droid razr phones whenever i try to transfer files on the card it makes the phone freeze completely i have tried every possibility to get this to work but this type of card is worthless because it does not work due to its high capacity on phones every workaround i have tried to get this card to work it still causes my phone to freeze
1,sound quality is worse one speaker is not working after only months of purchase
1,i have watched all seasons so far on the bbc and i would like to share my brief thoughts the first two series are great as they have a continous narrative after which the program becomes style over substance and in season everytime someone enters a room its in slow motion to music watch the first two seasons then dont bother with the rest
1,the fit of this sweater did not flatter my bodytype the top half did not fit well the armpit area was loose fitting and the neckline was awkward
1,please dont buy anyone facing ips glow after days of purchase
1,waste of money i wonder why companies like hp make this kind cheap products
1,very bad performance
1,i had put off watching the white lotus for awhile however when i finally sat down to watch it i binge watched season and within a couple of days i would have to say that i preferred season over season i think that is because it felt a little more quirky and a novelty i love how each season opens up and then goes back in time it definitely has you on your toes and guessing as to what is going on im usually pretty good at guessing who done its though this show is a who done it with a twist the cast have been brilliant in each series i am really looking forward to season the great thing about the premise for this show is that it can keep going different locations different guests different murders if you are looking for your next binge series then this is definitely worth watching
1,its not good laptop got defective within one month
1,a super strong start in episode taking what the game did beautifully and running with it while building additional story around it if its not broken why fix it its a great game the hook is the beginning it starts so fast and so brilliantly delivered you just cant leave and want to know whats coming around the next corner the series chooses this same timing and formula the use of music from the game from the same source also be a welcomed addition nothing transports you quicker into the past than music instant triggered memories of a world gamers will have spent a lot of time in you can see time has been spent on the writing on the story structure and story boards all there in the details episode two becomes bigger then the game choices made for the game are elevated the writers finding ways of putting new spins on what we expect i wont be giving spoilers in this review but the choices made at the museum are impressive having much more impact in the series and teaching us more about this new worlds survival rules we think we know where going for episode three and then takes us in a different direction for a long period of time you still think you can see the way back to the games formula then you reach a point of understand this will be something different a very human story of the needs of people to survive and thrive rather than just exist this episode couldve been an apocalypse movie all of it owe beautiful choices by the writers which will increase the burden on joels shoulders further down the road the choices he has to make and surely be influenced by the happenings of this episode
1,laptop ok but display border not premium quality its very low quality and remaining everything ok i purchase this laptop last days back

1,jenna ortega literally turns the wednesday adams character on its own head with a tale of teenage angst and foul things that are afoot in her new school ortega is simply splendid as the dour wednesday adams who has a penchant for all things unnatural and dead she dresses in black and grey and is a exceptionally awesome dancer when thrust into the limelight at the school prom catherine zeta jones does a satisfactory job as morticia but gomez is bland and unlikable lurch is no more than a onlooker in the onsuing shenanigans theres also a outstanding turn by thing the cgi is top notch and most episodes are worthy of season but again jenna ortega carries the whole show with deathly gusto
1,bad experience because my product is not working all ready complaints regarding but not correct answer and not return not helpful this is not good my product is not good working
1,im usually a fan of maeve but this dress is just bad the fabric is thin and filmy and it stretches to sheer over your chest the turtleneck is neither tight nor loose it just droops in a most unfortunate way

1,this looked like a simple chic blouse but the fabric felt cheap to me like thin lining fabric the neckline is too deep and wide as well and so not flattering
1,batterys performance is not good
1,surprisingly not a hit with the group of teen guys i fed it to i think it was too mushy not enough substance i make a similar trifle dish but with much more brownies to make it more cake like too much trouble and not even one person said they liked it
1,im giving one star just for the battery performance i purchased it days back i charged it and shut it down but when i wake up in the morning nd saw open my laptop the battery was without using anything and now i have to connect the charger while using laptop battery is running only to hrs not more than that i think manufacturers should focus on the battery
1,i thought this top was so cute but when i tried it on it is so big on the bottom it looks like a tent i normally wear a l or xl and took it back to the store to try on a medium and that one fit better but the bottom was still too big sad
1,just as with many other reviewers here my card worked perfectly for the first week and a half and then suddenly lost its format and could no longer be reformatted while at the same time overheating dangerously sandisk is currently issuing an rma to replace it but i am worried that the replacement could also end up being defective as is evident from the star reviews here the rate of such defects for these cards is about which to me seems like an absolutely unacceptable number for a memory card for a major manufacturer and its not like sandisk hasnt had a headsup on this problem the negative reviews have been there for quite a while clean up your act sandisk

1,a cut above the other disney starwars productions there is depth and texture to the environments from the realworld sets and locations used in this show that is missing in the others additionally there is a large contingent of extras to inhabit the worlds making the worlds more lived in these combine to really make it more immersive for the viewer the improvement doesnt end there where the other disney starwars shows have wafer thin plots dragged out to fill the time allocated the storytelling in andor is full and rich by comparison the pace clips along leaving the viewer to want to stay up to watch just one more episode before bed
1,loved the colors but the fit was less to be desired very wide under arms too much material looks more like a maternity dress i ordered a small petite would have needed the xs but now it is no longer available oh well returning this
1,usually love simple products by this toner left my face so sore and red

1,im normally a small in retailer tops i ordered a small and the top fit well in the shoulders and in the upper more fitted part it all went horribly wrong from there the top billowed out at the bottom and fit like a circus tent instantly adding a good pounds to my frame this was such a disappointment as the pattern is beautiful and the fabric is high quality
1,the model shows its out of warranty and it always get weird static sound from right speaker on boot up after i shut it shutdown for over hours and the right speaker completely stops working
1,first of all i am not sure if the product i received is a class memory card the reason why i say this is that the maximum write speed i get on my windows system is mbsec also i have issues with my system recognizing the card and i do frequently receive disk cannot be formatted errori am totally dissatisfied with this product considering the fact that i have a brand new laptop do not recommend sandisk please check other brands
1,this dress is so cute i went to the store to try it on and although i knew the dress would fit i could not get the zipper up my mom the sales lady and i all tried to get the zipper up and it would not move past the ribbon i wish i could have bought this dress but i cant without a working zipper i tried a size up and every dress at the store that was my size and none of them worked please fix the zipper problem so i can have this dress
1,battery backup is too bad
1,this dress looks nothing like the photo the sequins are dull no sheen at all the faux leather panels and straps look and feel like cheap shiny plastic i didnt even try it on because it was so hideous when i pulled it out of the box not remotely worth the price and wouldnt buy it on sale for either skip

1,i ordered this memory card for my drift ghosts action camera i started getting errors and the camera was freezing and saying there was a storage problem i assumed the camera was faulty and actually exchanged it for another camera same errors i switched to a sandisk extreme card and never had problems againif youre going to be recording hd video especially at high frame rates then do not get this card im sure it would be fine in any other scenario though but its advertised as a class uhs card and its just not as fast as other class uhs cardsdrift innovation the company that makes the ghosts camera i use has stated in multiple support tickets with me not to use any sandisk ultra cards because they do not perform fast enough for the camera and will result in slow card errors they work ok until you try recording p video at higher frame rates
1,everything was amazing in this series all the actors played their roles beautifully actually it reminds me about game of thrones i was missing that series but this series is also amazing love it
1,this pie is very heavy on crusttopping it definitely needs some flavoring cinnamon nutmet etc very bland will not make again
1,in short the series is literally what my title says i have seen insane ratings here from stars to it is neither absolutely marvelous nor the worst series ever i am assuming those ratings are from hardcore fans who are either loving it or despising it for someone who hasnt read the books or played the games but keeps a little idea of the franchise it is worthy of an above average title coming to the positives this show has very fluid and pleasing fight sequences fantastic set pieces and great cinematography the romantic aspects are nicely done as well as the action i was doubtful of henry but he has single handedly carried the show so far fantastic delivery and great dialogues despite having a lower budget compared to got the effects are also nicely done now getting to the negatives there are a lot of issues with the story telling they are going with as i havent played the games or read the books from episode it was very very hard for me to follow they failed to explain the origins of some of the characters properly and the timeline felt very odd and hard to understand because there was a bunch of flashbacks that just felt like happening in real time the main issue with this series is that it isnt viewer friendly at all if you are making a show for a broader audience make it easier to catch got did a fantastic job at that since people did not feel left out at all it really sucks when a viewer has to look things up on the internet which could be easily explained in the show apart from the story telling few of the casting choices were pretty bad to me the casting choices of king foltest fringilla and triss felt very bad they were bland and not intriguing at all i really want to get in this show and like it hopefully they will not screw this up like got did and just stop going with the fan service
1,i have other stevies and these are nothing like them the quality is very synthetic to a point that the material is shiny the pants themselves run very small in the waist approx two sizes too small compared with other stevies additionally the cuff is sewn like that in place and hits at an odd spot if you are taller or have strong calves see how it gapes in the cuff on the model like a rounded bottom that is way more emphasized in real life buyer beware
1,just a doubt about the egg whites are they beaten
1,poor performance
1,display blinking new laptop
1,i ordered this to wear for a holiday party hoping to have something unique and dressy it was too bulky at the shoulders and looked like something a football player would wear the little ruffled flower pieces were random at the top and stuck out in all the wrong directions it wasnt as elegant as the model pic is it ever and for this price should fit like a glove went back within seconds also its pretty short and bulky short isnt flattering on too many people
1,that keeps hanging and then you can use the nixht morefor what it costs it is not good
1,the product i received is the worst ive ever encountered the sound quality is extremely poor with noticeable distortion even when the volume is only halfway up additionally it lacks a usbc port for the laptop the hinges are not sturdy and the overall build quality is very subpar also the battery backup is very low at most you will get hours as compared to what is shown on the flipkart website overall the product is a defective one the seller has been unresponsive despite my read more
1,poor product quality no display work
1,very bad product
1,i was disappointed with the style and quality of this dress it poofs out funny in the waste and it just looks very unflattering im sending it back
1,this is a beautiful shirt the back is a few inches longer than the front which makes for a cool effect the only thing that i didnt like about this shirt was how fragile the buttons on the back are i was taking this shirt off and one popped off when i went to hang it another one popped off so i had to return it such a shame
1,i love cherry desserts and i wanted this recipe to be as delicious and special as so many reviews said however it was so plain tasting
1,keyboard backlit is not there and even brand promise the years of warranty give only year of warranty go for slim of this variant
1,dont buy this product they are selling refurbished laptop and there is no ms office with lifetime validity external mic not working heating issue be careful full guysdont buy this product guys please dont buy this

1,worked great in my galaxy s and died about months later what a waste of a lot of money
1,battery and sound not working
1,beautiful jacket and i got lots of compliments true to size its not thick but its very warm
1,cheep quality
1,much to my surprise when i tried on this sweater i found that it was cut in a bell shape and not at all fitted or straight like in the photo when i pulled it out of the package i thought id ordered the wrong size because the shoulders looked so narrow but when i tried it on the shoulders fit perfectly with beautiful detail and high quality material but the sweater belling out to a very wide shape it is very wide at the hip and looks out of proportion it doesnt look anything like the phot
1,didnt get the accidental damage protection as mentioned in the listing as well as invoice flipkart customer service team is worse in handling these issues and will simply ask you to call again and again like we are sitting here just for them
1,defect fault overheat sound not clarity
1,this dress had so much potential the top was absolutely gorgeous my issue was with the bottom half of the dress the bottom is made from a heavy quilted material that is stiff and has no movement at all the dress is supposed to fit like a modified mermaid dress where its more fitted around the hips and flares out the dress i received had so much material on the bottom that it actually made my hips look bigger i though about having the dress altered but decided to return instead
1,the display quality and build in quality is very very low please dont buy this product the saddest thing is not being able to return only option for replace they mentioned it is core i but it seems that it is core i
1,waste product
1,battery is very worst
1,ah i wanted to love this but without anything under it as pictured the petite sizing reveals way too much side boob i am and a small b cup i ordered an xs petite it fits but there isnt enough material under the armpits the fabric and design is great other than this flaw sadly returning
1,defective product the most worst product i have ever bought
1,the unit shows bytes in a pc or the phone it keeps dismounting also i got a replacement and it did the same thing not sure what is going on but it looks like a chinese counterfeit case i have seen this happen more and more lately amazon seems to be a major portal for these hings it makes sense with a such a large retailer they cant check everything
1,i should have listened to the previous review online before ordering unfortunately this will go back as the design fit and proportions are simply off i love uniquely shaped wraps like this but this one didnt make the cut for me
1,sound qulaty very poor
1,i received a defective piece laptop screen is not working
1,similar to others here these pants were ruined after one wash the first pair i bought simply faded after one wash which was okay but the second pair got weird splotches on the backside id rather not call attention to that particular area of my body couldve been a great addition to my wardrobe if they were better quality
1,i loved season one interesting if not all likable characters fun storyline excellent actors season starts out okay but quickly devolves awful characters confusing motivations nothing to sink your teeth or interest into centered more on graphic sex scenes than a storyline is there really a story here too bad i had been looking forward to it not a single reason to watch season the ability to have a fun show mixed with mystery and good subplots was lost in season however since these are stand alone series i would still recommend season one if you havent seen it just stop there
1,could not figure out why this card crashed multiple times in my samsung galaxy siii and demanded a reformatting then after hrs of calls to sprint samsung i got a guy who reads factory stuffsamsung galaxy siii is a class class supported motherboard with qualcomm processor the sprint stores only sell class memory and there is a reason that camera memoryclass is not sold there the board just like in a pc has to support the data stream it does notif you have an android phone you better make sure the motherboard supports it even samsungs usa website does not tell you the board supported memory they wont and dont tell who the board manufacturer is in this galaxy siii phone i asked at the texas samsung advanced tech support center after hr on hold and they had no specs to even share they dont get itpass if you have a cell phone unless you get it in writing from the motherboard manufacturer of your phone i went through this same stuff building custom pcs with intel motherboards memory has to be built to run on this board at this speed with this processor or it will not work properly and will crash and lose data
1,i started watching wednesday because of all the hype it got but i really dont get it i mean its not a bad show but it seemms a bit childishteenage drama instead of a mistery that would appeal to all ages as it seems it did jennas performance was great and it is noticeable the effort she put into it but that doesnt explain the huge sucess it turned in to maybe i would understand it better if i had watched the movies first but that isnt necessary for the global understanding of the show it ended on an interesting cliffhanger even after de villain of the firts season was unveiled so i guess theres hope of a better second season overall i would say its average especially because my expectations were very high but since it has only episodes why not watch it
1,this skirt was horrible on me it was loose in the waist tight in the hips and poofed out like crazy at the tiered part on the bottom the material also felt cheap and clingy i guess the fit is tts but its hard to tell given how strange the cut was
1,i wish i had read the reviews prior to purchasing this skirt looks amazing in photos and lace appears black the lace on mine is actually purple at first i thought it was just purple due to lighting with red underneath but nope pull the netting away and it is purple lace netting hikes up on the right due to poor craftsmanship i ordered a medium and felt it was a bit large will return
1,i usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops ordered this top in an s and it was so wide on the sides and huge it fit like a tent not even remotely flattering i thought about ordering it in an xs however i could tell the xs was still going to have way too much fabric back it goes
1,the first few episodes were great good memories of the originals brought back to life a little too much nonsense not related to the originals but still decent everything beyond episode was complete garbage in every possible way not worth watching past episode jenna ortega emma myers gwendoline christie hunter doohan jamie mcshane riki lindhome percy hynes christina ricci george burcea and tommie jenkins were the only actors who played their roles well and who were memorable and fit into the show the way it should be all others were not memorable at all or tainted the show in a bad way because of bad acting dull or boring characters because they didnt fit what the characters should look like or act when compared to the originals or otherwise jenna ortega was phenomenal throughout the entire thing she held the show together the actors who played gomez morticia deputy ritchie and bianca were atrocious in their roles and their characters were cringy for the viewers the first episodes are worth it kinda after that dont bother wont be watching season if that ever comes stars for the only good episodes do better netflix
1,bulid quality was floop battery backup also
1,i was very excited about this dress having seen someone where it on the street months ago i got my usual size and could not button it up for the life of me i get it im busty and sometimes button downs are a tricky however the arms were impossibly tight my boyfriend starting cracking up when he saw my arms busting out of the sleeves
1,i dont mean any insult but hamburgers do not have potatoes in them there is a much better recipe on food network from diners driveins and dives sorry
1,im a huge fan of the game i played it over and over again it helped me through the hardest parts of grief i went through after losing my fiancé in a car crashso as you can imagine this game means everything to me so i was really excited for this show while also trying not to be too hopeful because video game adaptations dont usually go well but im blow away by how good the first episode is they really do capture the spirit of the game the acting is great and there were so many nods to the fans of the games some scenes and dialogue being almost exactly the same while also giving more backstory to things we never got to see in the game honestly thank you for making this game into a show i cant wait to see the rest
1,i bought a inch tv online using walmart right after buying the tv my bank card was hacked and charged after i just bought a tv using walmart online never use your bank card always use a prepaid card when buying online
1,dont buy this product there are too much heating problems from the very first day of use if you only join a google meet its heated too much very bad product
1,i seriously do not know how this recipe got stars i picked it bc of its high rating this is quite possibly one of the most awful banana bread recipes i have ever tried it was dry crusty tasted like cardboardi do not know how its possible to make banana bread not even taste like banana bread but this recipe managed to make that happen
1,after using for month performance is good for normal work little bit issue with keypad but lenovo service and flipkart communication with seller is pathetic warranty given is for years on the flipkart website but lenovo will give only one year of warranty and start date of warranty might be earlier by months that they will update after wasting your some of the times but will not give the deniel letter for years of warranty and flipkart will ask the same so at last you will just read more
1,i loved them on when i got them but they literally frayed apart on my body as i wore them and i had them on no more than times it was not a fit issue or a seam issue they literally just frayed apart in two areas while flattering and incredibly comfortable the fabric was not at all durablethey are not your typical denim they almost kind of a knit feel them
1,i have to agree with the first reviewer i really loved the color of this dress and could almost have overlooked the lack of a lining but when i felt the fabric expecting a nice lush silk instead getting what felt like a polyster instead i couldnt justify it for the price i really liked the fact that a maxi came in petite sizes as well but just couldnt get over the poor quality for that price so back it goes i hope the team members or buyers at retailer are reading these reviews
1,battery issue
1,i bought the sandisk gb micro sd card class in dec for a new galaxy s i used it for songs and video and pics it started acting flaky in april and would unmount itself and then remount and i had problems with playing music then it completely died and would not even reformat this is a known issue and i will write back after i try to get sandisk to replace it
1,i tried this shirt at my local retailer and absolutely loved it until i read dry clean only really retailer i know you can do better than that
1,i agree with the other reviewer who said there was too much hardware and such this really does have a lot going on i usually wear a in skirts and based on reviews went up one size it still saw way up near my chest i think even an would be too small its sooooo tiny at the waist probably buy sizes and sizes up from your own also the skirt flares super wide at the sides it doesnt sit the way in the photo or maybe the model is holding it down with her hand its like a skirt
1,i have been looking at this sweater online since it first came out and i finally ordered it when it was off i ordered a size m petite sadly when it arrived and i tried it on it was very boxy stiff like and did not flow like it looked on the model online so i sent it back
1,this chromebook is not good and not supporting any of the application its not as expected
1,laptop not working properly repeatedly shutdown during working
1,worst product not working properly lake in minute minute dont buy it
1,i feel in love with this piece the color are gorgeous and i received so many compliments it lifted my mood just wearing it sadly ut the end of the first wear i had a run up the front and by the middle of the second wear the light fabric got caught on something and a hole developed upon further inspection i found another hole at the top where the price tag must have been attached i also noticed all over pilling after the first wear so sad they should recreate this in a heavy fabric
1,i definitely dont recommend this recipe without some serious tweaking the ratio of potatoesbacon to sour creamcheese is ridiculous this might be good if you doubled the potatoes and halved the dairy or added a ton of other ingredients to cut down on the richness but otherwise its nearly inedible i made it entirely as directed total bust
1,kharab product not working
1,touch and keyboard is not working properly and blinking of display so many times so i would like to say this product is not good therefore dont buy this product
1,started out clever and funny with the usual dark humor the addams family features are known for but it devolves into a occultic and satanic mess and dont get started on the political propaganda definitely not recommended for children or adults for that matter they could have taken the high road but chose the low road instead a big disappointment on a positive note the episodes are well made very atmospheric and stylish with a great score to accompany the story very tim burton but its not enough to overcome the rest of the major problems that deflate this series into a very very hot mess
1,dont buy laptop from flipkart just cheating customer no warranty u wl get alway less warranty from flipkart i got just month warranty flipkart customer service so pathetic they not help u
1,the description says maybe its the cream cheese where is the cream cheese in the recipe ingredients it says sour cream and whipping cream not cream cheese
1,heating problem i was using only min and too much high in the life corner side
1,it is worst laptop in centuryperformance battery backup camera all are worst within a minute its started heating laptop is better than this laptop
1,the sd to microsd card adapter that comes with this product is too small it is impossible to remove the card from the adapter without damaging it
1,im not familiar with the original version of the addams family but i was hoping to see something interesting from the once intriguing tim burton i gave up in frustration at the end of the fourth episode oh yes burton really seems to have lost his mojo at this point at least in my opinion jenna ortega is really good and plays the character well but everything else is mediocre to be kind a few interesting sections wednesday playing the violin on the roof the dance scene and a few quotes are not enough to make passable a series that mixes the most boorish teen drama with the most generic detective slash monster story possible too bad indeed
1,the product is bad and well within the warranty period they are refusing the service onsite even though the invoice specifically states that just an unacceptable product backed by terrible customer service never again a lenovo
1,even at a very deep discount this piece is definitely not worth the money the picture made me think this jacket had a longer curved velvet hem as part of its design which would be coolwhich is largely what attracted me to it but as i discovered when it arrived that was actually part of the shirt worn beneath in the photo so this image is rather misleading the actual jacket is very thinmore like a shirt with an open front than a jacket the pockets are just loosely tacked inside for
1,i have an old sandisk sd card that still works i thought their new cards would be just as reliable but i was wrongthe microsd card failed yesterday inside my phone i used the adapter to connect it to my computer but it wouldnt mounti bought this directly from amazon and not a third party vendor so i know its genuine sandisk

1,ofter one month use problems start
1,it worked for a while i purchased of them then they just started dyingone by one none no longer work
1,this shirt was great for one wear after just one wash followed instructions to dry clean it lost all shape and now hangs like a bed sheet terrible waste of money on a pricey top
1,i hated this season so much all the dialogues felt forced and felt non organic geralts character feels so unnatural as he is giving this unnatural speeches lot of side characters felt unnecessary and overall hated the season their adaptation is so bad i could barely understand the timelines of things that are taking place witchers character feels like a side character than the main character the cgi is bad too its so bad i thought i was watching a dream sequence until i realised it was not to be frank i did not plan on watching this season in the first place but watched it anyways to see how it goes guess this will be my last season
1,not as an expected
1,dont buy this is not a laptop its top do not support the ms word android version also then what you do others all things you have your mobile phone dont waste your money
1,within one month laptop broken not good hz is not working properly other company laptop is good then this one dont go for this asus laptop
1,i tried on this jumpsuit in black and it was absolutely beautiful i liked that it looked sort of like a tuxedo i wore it one time and received so many compliments when i washed it however it shrunk almost size the pant legs were high water i even tried washing and restretching it because i loved the jumpsuit but it wouldnt budge i think because rayon is not stretchable material to my disappointment i returned it i really wished it would have worked out
1,love this top but unfortunately i returned it for exchange coz it was too small for me hoping theres a sz sm in stock
1,i loved the dress but just not dressy enough after rethinking what i needed very easy order and return thanks

1,although i love retailer this product isnt the quality or presentation i expect from them the dress arrived stuffed into a small plastic bag and was a crumpled mess the fabric wasnt soft and fluid as i expected but rather was stiff and a little scratchy i purchased the ecru version which was also slightly darker than the photo showed i returned the dress and will keep looking
1,sounded interesting so i gave it a try this was much too sweet and the bottom was hard ill stick with my old triedandtrue
1,i know what am purchasing by the way its an amazing product from hp but flipkart gave me a defected producted and refused to replace another good one at the same price rather they offered refund which am not so happy with so think twice before getting electronics from flipkart
1,this blouse has too much drapey fabric and its just not flattering in the front part of the blouse the fabric is relatively short but the sleeves have so much excess fabric it almost looks like a clown suit sending back
1,scam i bought this laptop few weeks back within a week touchpad is damaged and white light was seen on the screen i bought this laptop along with complete laptop protection from jeeves they are a bigger scammers who continue to remain in flipkart site despite scamming several people
1,first of all i want to stay i went into watching this show knowing nothing and expected little but wow was i amazed from the first minutes of the first episode i was instantly hooked tim burton has created this masterpiece of a show starring jenna ortega as wednesday she nailed it out of the park and i really enjoyed her performance as wednesday the story was written well and is extremely fascinating the show is also visually stunning plot wednesday adams gets sent to nevermore the school where her parents fell in love and she soon discovers the many mysterys within go watch this show

1,wow just wow the acting is so good by everybody there is so much acting with just the face and body language no expletive this is what happens when a talented group of people use and respect the source material dang i am loving it pedro is killing it as joel at first i didnt love bella as ellie i thought she was too vulgar and hard edged but i think they found her stride as the show goes on you see the kinder more sensitive and vulnerable side of her every episode is paced wonderfully they keep the tention up and the plot moving forward great i just really love that there is such a good show being made based on a popular preexisting medium done the right way usually shows and tv really fail when working from an existing source halo tv show but man did they get it right this time great work
1,great acting by the main characters nice story if it was less political correct than i would given it a

1,after reading the reviews i sized down to a once i received it i loved the fabric and color however it was so illfitting its like the designer didnt even use female measurements and used a box to make this toptoo wide i liked it so much that i sized way down to a and it still fit horribly it is too wide and not long enough both are going back

1,i got really hyped when the last of us was announced to be made especially by hbo and the partnership between neil druckmann and craig mazin druckmann is the one who gave us this incredible story developed it in the part and managed to stick to the game foundations keeping up the pace the range of emotions and the impact it will have on you first episode looks promising all the teasers and released materials so far are heavily linked with the atmosphere of the game and i cant wait to see more i can link the dynamics dialogues and the overall atmosphere with the one ive experienced in the game i was a bit disappointed when bella ramsey was set for ellies role i thought kaitlyn dever would be the perfect fit for the character visually and from her performances i saw her as the one for the role still time will tell if ramsey was the right pick for it as someone who played both games i found it surprising that theyve added a few things to the series on top of the experience from the original games but these surprises are good it adds up to the story druckmann was telling us in the games so they are very welcome to all the people who hadnt played the games sit back enjoy the ride of emotions and events and i hope they will end it right same way as theyve started it
1,i loved this dress online and was luckily able to locate it in a store about an hour away from me i drove to the store to purchase it however when i tried it on i was so disappointed the print is adorable and it is made of great quality but the swing style is definitely more than mini i could have fit of myself in this dress it is definitely not as depicted in the photographs also the background of the dress is way more pink than appears in the photos and the floral print isnt as r

1,ive been shopping at retailer since and floreat used to be my favorite designer but for the past year or more floreat mostly misses the mark this blouse looks nothing like it does on the model it is long on her not so in real life this is probably the worst part about this blouse if it were not for this i might try on a size m and give it another chance it runs very large i usually take a l or xl i think i would need a m in this as mentioned above in the picture t
1,i agree with the other reviewer about the great colors but when i took this off the rack to try one you can see through both layers of fabric i thought insulting quality for the price i imagine the holes would start after one wearing
1,the colors on this kimono are amazing and i really loved it however i too noticed the delicateness of the material it is so delicate that parts were starting to fray including next to the kimonos label so sad
1,so bad
1,the back of the shirt has a tag stitched in with red thread that goes through to the outside of the shirt it is very visible and looks terrible especially since the back is the focal point of the shirt do not recommend
1,worst company
1,this recipe was given to me by my neighbor i thought i would make it today and it turned out horrible omg it was terrible the bread did not rise at all im not sure why this happened im not sure why everyone has given this bread recipe five stars if i could i would give it zero i have made bread before and it always turned out great i followed the directions to the tee i am thinking i should have used bread flour instead of allpurpose flour i am very disappointed im planning on throwing this recipe in the garbage i plan on making bread from the youtube channel jenny can cook now jenny can make delicious bread and it turns out good every time
1,this dress just fits weird maybe it works for somebody there is a reason it has been put on sale

2,since there was no cinnamon nutmeg or apple pie spice in this recipe there was really no flavor crust was good but if i make again i will be adding the spices
2,i have used comfort pure for years only to find the last one i bought has a really awful smell i tried other shops and the smell is the same obviously you have changed the perfume without letting anyone know your comments would be appreciated
2,i really wanted to love these i bought them in a rush because i needed to replace my skinny jeans asap they were a little long and didnt quite hug my calves but i figured with hemming they would be fine i was told they wouldnt stretch out much well they fit great at the waist but the legs are now huge on me and i cant get them to shrink wish i spent a little more on a different skinny jean too late to return so my hoping to be going out jeans are now lazy day jeans
2,we arent super fans of velveeta so it wasnt our favorite recipe fun to try though
2,in reallife usecopying compressed files to and from the cardit clocks in at barely over half the advertised speeds about mbs read and about mbs write as averaged between testing on several sd slots some usbconnected some pcieconnected on several computers plus a justreleased smartphone very unimpressed by the up to marketing of sd card vendors and makersthe actual raw size is also about gb which i find fascinating for a flash device which is only ever manufactured with powersoftwo components kb b
2,i have been waiting for this sweater coat to ship for weeks and i was so excited for it to arrive this coat is not true to size and made me look short and squat the sleeves are very wide although long as a light weight fall coat the sleeves dont need to be as wide because you wouldnt be layerng too much underneath the buttons need to be moved at least three inches in for a nicer fit i thought about redoing the buttons myself but the sleeves looked even more out of proportion with a tigh
2,great cast perfect ensemble great sense of humor great script a fun watch it has all the elements to make you want to binge watch these eight episodes and yes reacher kicks some butts
2,i didnt really care for this but i am also not a big tomato sauce fan it certainly didnt live up to its hype i used half ground beef and half sausage with cheese ravioli i might try it again with extra cheeses and spices but then again i might not bother
2,dress is pretty i was disappointed by the slip which is too small like previous customer i am an inch taller than the model and i feel more comfortable it being a tunic with leggings nice but not nice enough to keep i am returning
2,i read the previous reviews and ordered down a size knowing that the shirt runs big i really wanted to love the shirt however it was a tent with all of the extra material in the back it billowed out in all the wrong places the material is comfy and its a very cute concept just didnt work for me
2,quality of product is very
2,really wanted to love this top but the proportion was not right for my body type also the print with the silhouette was a bit too country bumpkin for me

2,these jeans are adorable im so sad they didnt fit my legs are bigger than the rest of my body but i usually have good luck with wide leg pants if you are looking for wide legs these are not the jeans for you
2,no matter what ingredient they have put in for exfoliation the tissue is thick and rough and my face was so painful during each wipe and turned all red eventually it is not a pleasure at all and is not comfortable to use i should buy one pack in store and try first before order this packs in a box i personally dont like it if anyone out there is using this happily can contact me to take away the rest
2,fits very strange odd cut does not look well on
2,as other reviews have mentioned this top has serious craftsman ship flaws strings hanging off embellishments on sleeves and they begin unravelling as you try the top on i wanted to love but sadly returned asap
2,stars still arent working right all are blackid give it a one star although hubby said he liked it wont make it again was dry prefer my shrimp stirfried or coconut covered
2,i cant believe there are bad reviews were only one episode in but the cast is phenomenal and the story is captivating its sexy intriguing layered with complex well developed characters and great acting
2,its not good dont buy anyone really i am not believe flipkart for shopping
2,i wanted to love this top but it looks like an ambitious year old made it with rumpled fabric and lace found in her grandmothers attic re hopeful but not good the quality is not good and it hangs strangely on sadly it is going back
2,after reading the reviews i had high hopes for this dress but was disappointed that it wasnt flattering on me im pounds and generally wear a size small but the small of this dress looked more like a maternity outfit on me it squeezed the bust a bit too much and left open some of the areas just under the arms that could probably have used a teensy bit more coverage to be truly flattering
2,a really good friend of mine recommended the series to me and after watching it i understood why it was popular wednesday is a genius tv character with her wit and insensitivity and in addition i really liked ind who is her opposite and despite everything they connected i really enjoyed the plot and the series itself and you dont have to see the addams family to understand the series waiting for season the second part of the series was more interesting from the part of the prom it became more intriguing in terms of plot highly recommend the ending was very surprising and the actors are excellent each of them is excellent especially wednesday and enid themselves
2,watching entire series a second time even better characters with depth and nuance the bunkhouse gang is amazing this series is really well done pay attention sure hope season is a fitting conclusion
2,from the terrible unbearable episode to the inconsistency of the disney series it seemed like star wars was in a creative deadlock almost completely dependant on nostalgia and faloni playing out with cameos of prequel or original trilogy characters this is completely different not only from any other disney show but from any other star wars material this is not for children its an adult show dealing with an adult subject in an adult manner of course many of us enjoyed some aspects of the recent material kenobis minute fight between obi wan and darth vadar or mandalorians season luke and ahsoka but the fact of the matter is that that was just playing nostalgia not building upon new stories in the depth that is required in the modern age to keep a franchise alive and well this is not like that what they have done is add hbo level storytelling to the star wars world the writers of this take character development and world building seriously alongside with a coherent narrative strength that star wars was lacking at since probably ever they took the excellent starting point that made rogue one one of the best star wars films and improved upon it significantly with an excellent cast of actors employed to the best of their capabilities one feels their pain their oppression their need to escape the dystopia of the empire one begins to feel the struggle against the empire as not just a dumb fight between light and dark but an actual human struggle against fascisim and dictatorship which was something lingering in the surface but never explored in depth by the films and by doing so andor has shown a way forward for all of star wars one where character and story matter more than nostalgia and repetition and flashy lights one where the force and the eternal struggle of dark vs light can be brought to light in a way that feels human and in that sense truly heroic there are real heroes in the real world fighting fascisim and evil as we speak and through narratives like andor we are reminded of the importance of their fight revolution is serious the struggle against dictatorship the fight for actual freedom that is not a game for children where good and bad is as clear as night and day thanks andor for putting star wars one of the most popular media franchises in the world in the next level where it belongs may we always have at least a space of the franchise for top quality hbolike stories like this
2,sorry hate to write a negative review but thought this was terribly bland added a bit of horseradish celery seed more vinegar salt and pepper and more miracle whip to get it just ok
2,this was disappointing to me i love how this looks on the model unfortunately it made me look huge it was all bunched up after i buttoned and put it on i didnt find it was tts i am a m and got the m it was too tight in the waist before id even put it on i noticed the waist looked very small i dont even think the sizing issue caused the material bunching its like the buttons didnt match up or something
2,let me start off by saying how pretty this top is and heavyand itchy you would have to stand like the model does in the first shot to wear the top with your arms not touching any part of the top the sequins will itch if you put your arms down underneath the armhole another reason i didnt like the top was because the should straps are unadjustable i would have to get mine tailored for my frame i usually wear a medium or in tops and ordered this in a medium it was roomy
2,shorts dont fit me like they did the first time and ive only worn them twice the material isnt what is use to be it stretches out to fast i dont think i will be buying these again wish i could take them back
2,kevin costner leads an amazing cast of characters the story lines go from brutal to emotional topics addressed are important and timely scenery is amazing highly recommend
2,i really wanted to love this dress but it was not right for me made my curvy body look shapeless also had a button crack before i even put it on returned it
2,this series looked very good in coming attractions then first episodes were blah but since then the multiple storylines and characters have taken shape the conflicting relationships and the multiple lovehate situations have been excellent tv i found myself looking forward to the new episodes the most recent episode was one where i shouted yes out loud additionally i think the scenery is amazing the setting was perfectly selected
2,very bad product after downloading any app its not working video quality is very low looking good but it was waste of money
2,i love this top so much online i received it yesterday in the mail and unfortunately i am very disappointed there is nothing wrong with the quality but i do think it looks more appealing online also this top is probably not for anyone with a large chest it looks nice and drapey on the model when i put it on it just makes me look fat and the top thanks to my dds looks more like a swing top im sure its a lovely top on very thin people with a smaller chest
2,was disappointed in the runniest of this pie had to use several paper towels to sop up runny juices did not read reviews before putting top crust on would suggest taste of home rewrite recipe it for sure needs more flour on the upside has a good flavor we used honeycrisp gala macintosh and some sort of fancy apple just disappointed it was runny
2,material is awful not soft at all colors are much darker than shows online it is actually very short not at all as it looks on the model it went back
2,it looks like you are wearing cargo shorts really unflattering avoid buying this skirt
2,i purchased this top in blue and liked it so i ordered the red color i hated the way the second one fit im concerned the blue will not wear well after seeing the way the second one looked
2,power baton no on laptop
2,i wanted to like this series and had actually watched up to season midway but i got overwhelmed and just plainly put off by elizabeth mosss constant close ups my exact thought echoed here by several reviewers so apparently i am not alone just got tired of her faces weird projection that comes off like she is about to transform into an alien or monster or head about to explode as she semi lift her head with matching headneck twitching big ugly stare and pursed lip breathing so annoying and distracting i just had enough of her face and felt overdosed that i needed to stop watching the show to get a much needed withdrawal from her
2,bad product
2,there are connectivity issues with wifi and the key pad quality is not better than a toy my mouse pad stopped working within months of purchase
2,before i ordered this i noted the other reviews that said it was sheer but thought i would just wear a layer underneath unfortunately it was one of the sheerest fabrics ive ever seen would love it if it could have been a more substantial fabric to me it wasnt worth the money even on sale
2,its hard to believe the high ratings for this trash i didnt get past the second episode i noticed other comments mentioning that the show will make you cringe thats an understatement
2,i had this in my cart for a week before i took the plunge because i thought it would make the cutest boho statement piece that could go from beach to casual evening outings im so i got the ml to ensure length maybe that was wrong if the laid flat width was included maybe that would have been more helpful but this thing was massive and looked like a potato sack the side slits of course hidden in the photos came up to just over my natural waist enhancing that effect i loved the
2,it was advertised as great and full of exciting plot linesand yeti watched it as like to check out all new shows but definitely will not come back for season for one it isnt as extraordinary and full of twists and turns as stranger things and not half as funny or brutalthe adams family story has been already moderately exploited and that is just milking it to the full by streaming service the st episode was the least disappointing with wednesday being a bully to little brother and mayhem to her school disappearing tourist funthen after episode it gets weaker and weaker but this is maybe because i am not
2,alan ritchson plays the perfect reacher just finished binge watching the entire first season all episodes were fantastic i have been a fan of the books since the first book came out then lee child lost me as a fan when the demented little man tom cruise deluded himself into thinking he could ever pull off the role of jack no middle name reacher so many disappointing and pathetic shows have been released over the past few years that i had almost lost hope that anyone could pull off a well cast and directed tv show based on a popular series im looking at you wheel of time trust me when i say reacher will not disappoint whether you are a fan of the books or a new comer this series is time well spent
2,getting hang sometimes screengeta hang
2,this top seemed so unique online but in person it was really nothing like the pics super full shorter cut the quality wasnt what i thought it would be i will gladly pay for nicequality fabric and unique prints anyday but this wasnt any of those things
2,too bland for my taste even though i dont like spicy foods either i had a lot left over amp if i had served it again intended to add a can of crushed tomatoes instead after a few days in the frig i just threw it out it needed something just not sure what
2,this skirt for sure was the most disappointing thing ive ever ordered from retailer it looks like an all white skirt that has a little stiffness to it but looks are deceiving it has this weird checkered patten and there is no shape to the skirt at all there are also weird stitching lines one more thing that i didnt like about the skirt was that its a creamish color not even the cute flamingos will make me keep this skirt its going back
2,huge normally wear a medium and this was huge and very unflattering
2,i was in love with this suit from the pictures unfortunately the top is a little too short so the peplum skirt hits right at my widest part and doesnt meet the bikini bottoms
2,i received this dress in the mail yesterday right away i noticed the coloring wasnt quite the same as it appears in the images online in person the hints of brown appear more bronzy and shiny as opposed to more muted i was willing to look past that but then i tried it on i ordered a small which is my typical size in retailer dresses it ran quite large and was way to long for me i am overall between the coloring and sizing this dress wasnt a hit for me
2,a good part of my closet is filled with retailer clothes i mix them with my basics scarves and jewelry so i immediately thought of a dozen ways this kimono could jazz up anything from skinny jeans to slip dresses even though i felt it was pretty pricey when it arrived i was more than disappointed in the cheapness of the fabric it does nothing for any of my intended clothes so it is going back asap
2,whatever happened to sizing pretty print and color but has enough fabric for tops it is also unlined which is not a huge issue i wore it with a cami the arms werent too gaping for me thankfully i tried to make it work with a wide belt but i will have to get it tucked on the sides i am lbs and got the small should have gone or even sizes smaller
2,this was so unflattering the bust was too high so it hit me weird on the boobs the green was a beautiful vibrant color but the fabric is so delicate that one wrong move would cause a snag
2,i was so excited to wear this shirt even after reading the review that it curls up i decided to give this shirt a shot and i found that the same thing happened to me it also clings tightly to the body i would not recommend this shirt for anyone with broad shoulders
2,laptop shuts down automatically power backup is ridiculous i am a programmer i bought for increased ram and ssd but windows os is unstable now i have to spend few bucks t downgrade to windows not happy also you wont be able to connect your wired earphones for meeting or watching window it is such a hassle to use bluetooth headphones and keep charging laptop and headphones both just to complete my days work recommended not at all
2,i like the blue version but this is such an overpowering awful smell it had to be binned
2,i truly enjoy watching the series and the plot is very well planned out there is no over acting in the series and this is commendable elisabeth moss truly takes us into the psyche of june osborne and expresses thoughts ideas pain conflicts etc extremely well through her acting i am just disappointed that from mid of season three i have been finding some errors that are from the directors standpoint and i believe these should be looked into and avoided in the future it is very disheartening that both the directors and the editors missed these details which are not comfortable to viewers like myself who actually get so engrossed in the series that we are in the scene it kinda distracts when things fall out of place in case the editors or director wishes to get my input i would be more than glad to do so i really love the series and avoiding these mistakes will keep this among the top of the best made series out there
2,fabric much heavier than looks in picture also nothing mentioned in the description great color and fit but i live in florida
2,the design of this dress was very off for my lb d frame its lowcut and tight in the bust but then very voluminous and unstructured around the hips making me look wide there a belt didnt help much the fabric is nice but the overall effect of the dress was frumpy
2,i loved the star pattern of this top but the cut was odd it is very big in the chest and full at the bottom for anyone who is petite on top it tends to look sloppy
2,this top is so lovely but runs soo big i ordered it online and was so surprised when i tried it on at home im normally a size and i was positively swimming in this top hoping to exchange for a petite sm
2,within days only the impression of keyboard is getting on the screen i dont know hot to protect the screen the body is made of flexible plastic and they are clamming that its military grade design
2,the color and quality of this sweater are fantastic the reason i only gave it two stars is that the height of the neck didnt seem right to me it looked awkward and too high to be left standing upright but when folded over i wished it were higher so it formed more of a turtleneckcowl i will be returning the sweater because of that
2,very slow cannot sactisfied the quality trapped
2,unless you have the body of the model tall and very thin and wear a really small size dont even think about getting this dress its literally a heavy sack it hit right above my knee in the front and basically midcalf in the back the material is nice but its an awful shape
2,i bought the xs regular and it was a little too long and wide i was unable to find a petite version in the store or online the ruffles were also bigger than how they appear on the model i am tall and weigh lbs i believe the petite would have been a much better fit i regret not discovering this top sooner when more size options were available
2,when you look at the online pictures of the navy colored dress the stripes are diagonal however that is not the case with the dress in person the stripes are all horizontal and not that flattering such a bummer because i love maeve dresses and thought this would be a great addition to my summer dress rotation alas not very flattering so back it goes
2,after month it shows heating problem
2,all in all i liked the series otherwise i wouldnt have spent years with it i hated june from the beginning shes really annoying the last episode was a huge disappointment for me i didnt understand its purpose at all the badness is comparable to the pitiful final moments of game of thrones yes i think it was that bad i was expecting a final battle and excitement but all i got was some damn flashbacks the second to last episode was much much better and it raised expectations for the final episode even more a large number of issues also remained completely unaddressed and open too sad that the bad last episode ruined it all
2,i was excited to try this recipe followed it to the letter bread didnt rise properly the sides and bottom were burned and the middle was still mush i greased my pans really heavily so it would not stick still stuck im only giving this stars because it was an easy recipe what a waste of ingredients we couldnt even eat it
2,way too sweet and does not make doz i wont be making them again
2,i was so excited to receive this topped then i tried it on i am a petite and i normally wear an xs so i ordered it in both a size and a size it was huge it looked like i was wearing a potato sack i really wanted it to work because the fabric is absolutely beautiful i am so disappointed
2,i loved the style so i ordered on line it runs small and the arm inserts are so low its awkward to wear i wish the cut was better cause i love the look but not the fit i am returning this item
2,i would have loved this sweater if it were true to the picture but the stripes are gray not white either i got a strange one or as happens to me sometimes with retailer the pictures are very misleading disappointed because i wanted to love this
2,there are series and movies that pushes boundaries this is one of them mike white uses the same subject he already used in enlightened the concept of the road to hell is made of good intentions and now he moves it to a tropical resort where he makes a fierce critique of two very opposite classes the masters and those who serve them the same message of enlightened is here revised and expanded and through the relationships between the resorts inhabitants we discover that human stupidity does not relate too much to social classes although the rich ones take a good part of it we learn that masculinity has nothing to do with what men had thought and that it needs urgent review its a great show worth watching although i find the end a little hasty everything moves slowly through all episodes but at the final one i thought what this is the end thats how it ends
2,this dress is gorgeous as displayed at store color is vibrant but the one i ordered looked dull and wrinkles very easily i wore it to a ceremony and the seatbelt left me wrinkled before i arrived the top is very wide and best to wear strapless
2,beautiful shape and colors but the fabric felt heavier than i imagined sort of like heavy drapes also the length as others mentioned was too long i am not normally a petite but the regular was too long unfortunately it has to go back
2,my whole family was very disappointed with this soup we were expecting something amazing and it was just mediocre to us
2,this a very bad productplease dont buy it im regretting after buying it wasted my parents money
2,i love jumpsuits except for this one the fabric is blah its between plastic and the material that they make flags out of the print is adorable and the buttons up the front are super cute the tie thing thats just hanging there its a tie thing that just hangs there it doesnt look good hanging and it doesnt look good tied this jumpsuit had so much potential im definitely disappointed for sizing reference i am c and a small was perfect
2,i loved this shirt and attempted to buy it however the armhole is so small i couldnt barely get the shirt off and almost had to call someone into the dressing room to pull it off of me im usually a and i tried on the and and both shirts had the same problem it wasnt exactly the sleeve that was too tight but the arm hole that was not big enough it pulled across the top of my chest and was not roomy enough to slip in and out of which was odd because the rest of shirt was fine i d
2,so so recipe its more like a soup than a hearty chili the recipe calls for way too much chicken stock half that amount would have been more than enough the chili never thickens no matter how long you cook it again this should be called soup not chili way better chili recipes out there wont make again
2,when i saw the dress i loved everything about it except the arms made me a little nervous i ordered it when it went on sale and it turns it the arms are worse then i thought they would be they are like my grandmother crochet it and accidentally attached my childs dress arms on my dress
2,this pie tasted ok but the filling from the cornstarch mixture was very unappealing with the clear gel surrounding the diced apples
2,i recently bought this dress and wore it once i really liked it it was comfy cute and fit well but then i washed it i followed the washing instructions exactly but now it looks more like a shirt than a dress and its completely unwearable im super disappointed because i thought this dress would be a wardrobe staple this summer
2,like other reviewers have said this is very sheer look at the sleeve in the picture and youll get an idea of how sheer the body is as well the material posed challenges for its creater because one top i tried on in the store had a sleeve that was smaller than the other tight enough that it would have ripped if i werent careful tried on another identical top and the sleeves were a normal somewhat loose fit bodice portion is much more intense pink in real life loose billowy and perhaps
2,i advice not to buy this productthe overall performance is better but within one month of purchase i got a problem regarding powerwhen i charge it i showed it is charging but the battery percentage is not increasingfinally now it is in a hp authorised service center for repair it was all just in a span of less than a month
2,either something went terribly wrong could be my fault or it was not to anyones liking
2,this dress overwhelmed me im feet tall and the print and material just took over
2,i ordered a small but it was way to big it was very soft
2,i ordered this cardigan on sale and it was a wonderful fit and color just the light sort of cute pullover i was looking for to keep and wear at work unfortunately it is poorly made i wore it once and it already started to fray and fall apart after closely inspecting the cause i realized that the threads in the sweater are not fully sewed together so the minute you put it on one will start to unravel leading to a domino effect it is a shame because the design and cut were truly a great f
2,this piece didnt make sense to me maybe its bc im a yankee fan but it reminded me of a high end baseball jersey that was sheer i didnt think it was office appropriate but too dressy for casual wear it went back
2,hei hei is my favorite line i am a medium in all of the pants i have ever purchased from this brand i ordered these in the green and they arrived today they fit me as if they were an xxl i have a similar pair in rust from last summer so i assumed that they would be the same obviously they are going back tomorrow im very disappointed they are a nice looking jogger and the color is pretty
2,the mandalorian is a very solid show with a great cast brilliant writing and a touching story pedro pascal is awesome in the role and the character he plays din djarin is a badass space bounty hunter you dont even need to have watched star wars to enjoy this show overall
2,to much flour not enough cornmeal
2,i bought this to because i wanted to upload music to the disk for my off the computer listening this does not support music files so i have no need for this ive tried hooking it up with the flash card it came with ive tried putting it in my phone and hooking my phone to the computer ive tried through my mp playernothing i cant even get windows media to recognize the flashcard if youre looking for more storage for portable music dont buy this
2,a piece of polyester with no shape and looks good only on the model avoid mine went back the same day it came in the mail
2,ive never spent this much money on a sweater but took the plunge using the retailer day discount still painful but hopeful it would be worth it i ordered the xl hoping to compensate for the shorter length and it fell just below my hip bones so that part was okay while this looks like the cashmere is on the thinner side so the garment flows nicely its not the weight of the sweater is substantial heavier and much thicker than it looks the color is different too its tan and grey not whi
2,how are there so many reviews praising this piece of junk no story except a week in the lives of extremely unlikable people with a few bland boring ones thrown into the mix fortunately there are only episodes so i can get through the last while drinking my morning coffee
2,i bought this dress because it was cute swinging and lightweight seemingly perfect for this hot nyc summer after on wash and dry the dress is already ripped around two buttons ill still wear it but i dont think itll last until next summer kind of pitiful since it wasnt a cheapo dress also it is big but that seemed to be sort of the point
2,i loved the cut and style of this shirt so was very disappointed when i put it on and it was very tight and slightly seethrough if you do order it get it in a size larger
2,the skirt is just okay the design is great but the material is extremely thin and see through there is a slip which goes to midthigh very strange and felt weird as well the pleats are okay but not great overall it is not worth paying full price for or anywhere near that and again be wary of it being see through
2,loved the color and the deshn but when i put on did not look right waist was too short and the arms were long
2,this show has run dry on ideas and im done investing time none of the characters save jimmy grow or change its gone from a modern western to soap opera to add insult to injury the story now is completely unbelievable i really think that the duttons are the bad guys in their own show
2,blue bottle is alot better this smells less than blue bottle and when clothes are hanged outside on washing line you cant small anything
2,there was so much hype around this show and i just dont get it i knew thered be a problem after the first episode when there was no hook nothing happened to get me interested i spent pretty much the first episodes waiting for something to happen i just dont see the point of this show im at a loss if you want to watch a show about a bunch of white people on vacation doing vacation things this show is for you jennifer coolidge was good in it as well but not jaw dropping because her character was pretty one note and all the characters are pretty much unlikeable after it was over i apologized to my boyfriend for suggesting it
2,most shows when getting picked up by netflix after disappearing for a while dont have the same flare or charm it was that pulled people into the initial show however that doesnt happen with peaky blinders they brought back all the main and supporting actors whilst upping the budget and adding a couple new big names the writers and directors are the same so the show literally picks back up where it left off cillian murphy goes right back to form as an amazing tommy shelby peaky blinders is back and better than ever
2,the first season was great if murray bartlett does not win an award it would really be too bad some of his expressions were so nuanced for very screwy situations ala the scent at the table giving homosexual clues i loved everything although perhaps molly shannon did not fit for me as perfectly as some of the other characters also sydney sweeney was wonderful as a droll and spoiled gen z generally well written well cast well scored and well directed just enough conflict and resolution this may be more appealing for those of us who know people who fit into the roles or situations which makes it more interesting of course its not really simplistic but a complex mix of rich peopletype problems substance and nonsense like many of the hbo successes this series is complex enough to watch more than one time kudos to mr white
2,first of all amazon has shipped the mobile version of this card it is different that what was listed on the page there goes a star for incorrect shipping and the item has stopped working after a week in my surface tablet
2,my husband i and other family members look forward each week to see we cant wait for it to start and dont want it to end well done
2,i returned the dress because the color was not as pictured in the online photo i did not like the color
2,in this series you all know are getting a horror and upside down style its help us to find a different ideas this series tell us and we can be different we should be the way we are us every person need a friend we can do anything just keep a thing in mind dont hurt any good and innocent person wednesday seems to be like a bad person from her speaking style and her dress but apart from all this she is still a good person she doesnt had any great power but she can beat anyone she always judge any person according to hisher actions in past present and future in this movie i got all this in fixed amount
2,ditto what the first reviewer said unfortunately i was so looking forward to receiving this dress but the one received is not the one in the photos the graphics are fantastic still love the boats but the top is not the same and theyve added a fabric belt to the finished dress the fit was perfect except for gapping under the arms similar i suspect to what the first reviewer reported i was also surprised by the fabric based on the photos i was expecting something light and semi trans
2,just after weeks my laptop cannot be charged
2,cute but very itchy have to wear a long sleeve tee underneath
2,im on the shorter side of the spectrum and usually wear an xs in retailer this is a lovely suit but it didnt work at all for me it might work well on a taller person or someone who is longer waisted the ruching and fuller cut leg was not flattering on me at all it was very tight and pinched sadly i returned it
2,this dress is so pretty a true cinderella dress thats why i cant find a reasonable explanation for such an amazing dress to be made out of plastic i dont understand much about fabrics but the dress feels like a waterproof camping tent i bought a size which is what i wear in moulinette souers i usually go one size up since i find the rib cage small in this brand the fit was perfect and the cut was very flattering i will anxiously hope for a remake of this dress with a better fabri
2,i love jumpsuits for their style and comfort i loved the look of this blue silky piece and the review that said it was like lounge wear you could wear out of the house i agree that it is like lounge wear but for me there were a few challenges first the fit was small i am usually anywhere between a and a depending on style cut and brand i tried the small in this and it was not a flowy look or feel it was restrictive in the hip area in a way that would make me not want to wear th
2,i ordered a size large however as a large my chest is large as well this nighty barley covered me in the chest region the rest of the body fit well
2,i wanted to love this top but it unfortunately did not work for me the material has a nice weight and feel to it and while i love the pattern the shape leaves something to be desired the cap sleeves were a little tight on my arms and the cut of the sleeves made my arms look big the body of this shirt reminded me of a loose maternity top for reference i am lbs and typically a size i wear a small in retailer clothes and got a small in this top i think an xs would have been to
2,beautiful in pictures and i loved it before i tried it on as the other reviews state it is short and wide i like the top so much i am going to try to add some gathering across the back to offer some shape otherwise it is an unflattering shapeless box
2,it was very prettybut it ran very big sadly i had to return it
2,i love good flowy blouses and like the over sized look but this one didnt wow me i thought the quality was just ok it didnt flatter me i almost liked it but i didnt im glad i tried it on because looking at the pics online i thought id like it way more than i did just not great
2,i ordered this blouse because it was such a good price on sale but should have paid closer attention to the reviews the slits on the sleeves are much more noticeable than in the photo and the blouse just didnt work for me something about it reminded me of seinfelds pirate shirt i appreciate retailers return policy i took it back to the store and got an immediate refund on my cc
2,i had such high hopes for this shirt i got it in both the black and moss which is a beautiful color however the ruffle was just too big i put it on and immediately felt like a circus clown it would probably be beautiful on a woman with a more straight figure with fewer curves but on me it was not flattering at all
2,am i watching the same as the people who give a star rating for real then can anyone tell what is wrong with me and why is this series getting such a rating one star is way too much if you have problems sleeping oke watch this one i made it all the way trough episode someone said it was really good so i survived an other three im done father brown or midsommer murders has more story more humor and more exitement so dont waste your time with this like i did and if you font believe me and do try to make it all the way trough all seasons you are my hero congrats for the makers please leave it with three seasons even one was more than enough
2,this top is has an awkward neckline doesnt lay like the photo as mentioned by another reviewer see threw and of poor quality the fit is very baggy and unflattering and material is very thin it also runs very large the color is pretty but that is it
2,i love finding unique retailer pieces that dont require dry cleaning i was excited to find this shirt but its not flattering the bottom hem is a little tight which makes the rest of the shirt look bulky perhaps it would work better on people who have narrow hips i also didnt like the pink tones when i saw the colors in person ill be returning this item
2,to my personal opinion it is just a copy of harry potter with same features coctail otherwirlds magic secret forest magic skills of heroes magic school competition magic creatures school runaway even classes are similar secret plantslife and death side by sidebla bla bla i would say it is really hard to find the differences or novelties differences girl as main hero boat competition but not a magic football main heros self confidence nothing new a good copy of harry potters idea anyhow series are lovely and are watched with big pleasure not to say about ms ortega she is so cute and talented
2,a must watch series i cannot believe this is a tv series and not a block buster movie series so much to like and so well done i hate to say it but for me this made for tv series was better then the last star wars movies i was on the edge of my seat for the entire last episode hats off to the production team and everyone involved thank you for providing this escape in a time of need jd
2,does nt turn on even if charged and processing is way to slow not expected from this brand people think twice before buying this one
2,battery life is very bad only hours only one move watching after battery dad very cheep product dont purchase acer brand
2,ive already written a scathing review but im not satisfied this show is the worst attempt at art i have ever encountered saying that this show is purely awful is giving it a supreme compliment everyine associated with the making of this series should be deeply ashamed of themsrlves
2,i thought this top would be a little more form fitting than it is there is so much extra fabric near the bottom it is almost like a swing style top the fabric will most definitely snag as it is not a linen or cotton top material but rather a silky type and also very thin not very good quality i got the smallest size possible and it was absolutely huge everywhere but the neck
2,i bought this thinking i got it for bargain for washes however for my disappointment its not concentrated its watery and the scent its not strong so i need to put more of it when im washing my clothes rather than recommend amount
2,i love this dress but i will return it because the sleeves are too tight i have never had this problem before i ordered a petite and petite for reference i am tall and lbs the length is perfect and i really like the style if the sleeves had not been so tight i would have kept the petite the petite sleeves were no looser sorry that this did not work for me
2,so far so good it does what its supposed to do doesnt seem any faster or slower than any other micro sd card i had bought a cheap imitation on ebay and regretted it as it crashed it really doesnt pay to be cheap with memory its all about the reliability which you get with this product update big problem with this sd card if you are a windows phone user does not properly record hd video video recording to sd card is consistently choppy pop in another sd card records fine record to my phone records fine ive tried formatting it every which way and it isnt working well go with another brand windows phone users
2,this wasnt for me i have a short neck and am the length was fine on the one i tried on but other proportions were off it was too big around in the middle yet tighter at the bottom on me this made it resemble a large bag the neckline stood up on mine even when i pushed it down to resemble the picture here with the model it still felt like a whiplash collar coming up over my chin i gave it four stars for quality since the material is so soft
2,this thing was amazing it was the only way o could keep my son in his crib however it only last a month now the thing wont stay on even after changing the battery
2,did anyone else even come close to using cups of flour i used met before and it came out perfectly
2,while out and about in a photo shoot i had this card fail on me luckily im a backup freak and was just starting out for the day so i only lost a few pictures card completely died and had to be sent back to sandisk for a replacementthe whole process took a little over a week and communication was excellent so stars on sandisk supporti know about memory so i always have multiple cards available and if im out for an extended time spread my work out over cards to minimize riskwhat about the average person who throws all their data on this disk and looses precious memories sure they are at fault for not backing up their data unless you are shooting hd videos though chances are youre not going to fill this card up in a dayunless you either need the storage for hd video or something or your data is not important id say it makes more sense to just get several gb cards equaling gb at roughly the same or less price depending on brandagain sandisk support was great and they even asked if i needed data retrieved i cant recommend this card though
2,i have these shirts in the blue and green and they were great im c chest and athletic build the small shirts fit pretty good and i love the fabric so i kept them i really wanted these dresses to work but the cut was different even between the gray and burgundy there was tons of room in the chest but it was tight in the shoulders i really wanted to love this but theres just too many cut issues it is a good length for work though
2,i love the look of this sweater but just bought and put on at home and noticed pea sized holes in fabric near arm holes but not on seams not sure if i bought this way and did not notice or if fabric is just incredibly delicate will try to repair but scated this will not hold up look it over carefully before you buy they kind of look like moth holes
2,like a dream but very real unfortunately could not tell till minutes before ending who would be in the coffin another season please never visiting hawai for sure
2,so ordered online tried this on boyfriend asked me if i was buying maternity clothes back it goes super cute but huge
2,its a cute topper it fits nicely through the shoulders and arms and because of the aline through the bottom but the chest is sizes too small and i dont have a big chest the fabric is very scratchy and mine arrived unbuttoned and unzipped and i suspect it had been worn going back not tracy reeses best piece
2,really wanted to like this and took chances based on other reviews even with the sale price and addtl discount its basically blouse fabric with design and detailwork of a much more expensive blouse the white is sheer and and fabric will wrinkle easily if it were black you could probably get away with it but the white shows too many flaws and will wrinkle sad to have to send it back
2,ive enjoyed this dessert before and wanted to try to make it myself i think the numbers here are a bit off as recommended in the comments i used a larger dish there is a problem with the amount of pretzels used the cream cheese layer is delicious and super sweet and very very thin and would be just very thin in the smaller pan it would also make a good dip for fresh berries speaking of berries ounces of frozen strawberries i think that might be a mistake too im not pleased with this outcome and hope i have time to shop and redo it before the picnic tomorrow
2,they just seem a bit weird compared to the supermarket ones i pour hot water on them but the noodles are quite tough and dried out the ones from the supermarket as soon as i pour water on them i can easily mix it around with a fork but not these ones strange
2,its performance is not as expected boot period is quite long lags a bit after the boot battery drop issue also visible
2,peaky blinders is a show that netflix did good netflix is making a lot of junk and miss some quality products but this this is on a way different level life is hard life is not easy and peaky blinders showed that greatly how much work is required to do before you end something the gangster imperium is building up through the seasons and after two seasons or so i got a total connection with the peaky blinders the connection bond they are making is very strong i cared so much about the characters what happened to them what they did and i cant say you get addicted by them but you make a really strong bond especially with the main character thomas shelby the man with no limits the emperor the leader the man with so many hidden secrets to reveal his expressions and psychological journey is presented greatly and cillian murphy the man behind the tommy cap is an outstanding actor he was perfect to play a man surrounded by madness the whole cast was good anyway everyone even the less important characters were played greatly i cant say somebody played fake or plastic in some way and im happy about that british acting is generally speaking very good they made six seasons the first season was a good start that really spiced up things and started to make things more and more interesting the last five focused more and more on thomas shelbys inside minds but also on the enemies he had and the family he had to take care of the villains were great absolutely menacing and rememberable especially the italian luca changretta and inspector campbell the villain of the very first season rememberable characters is something peaky blinders does always the dialogues are fresh and original their are often many wise and clever quotes that are easy to remember the technicals are just fantastic too the music is always perfect picked for the scene when the sad scenes came they put some really good nostalgic music and when the action scenes came they put some really good and fitting heavy metal or rock and roll the scenography representing old england the old town birmingham london and so was amazing the light setup camera angles and filming quality was on the absolute highest level the suites and costumes weapons and hats were detailed and planned in every aspect the costumes could make me recognise which persongang it was very easily without even looking at the face the characters actions are mostly unpredictable and the suspense is holding in every episode thinking of that one episode is one hour isnt so surprising it can feel very long but the action is so holding and the plot is so good expanded that they use their time very well through all of the time i have used on watching the series i have to admit that it was a very good time it can teach you a lot and it shows greatly how life can be i recommend it for every fan of good dramas or gangster movies
2,a very slow machine its troubling me a lot better stay away from it
2,hitting problem
2,this dress is huge also i was super disappointed in the fabric i thought it would be silly like a georgette but it was coarse more like a poplin and thin i thought it looked cheap
2,why i can understand the hype and the fact its adapted after the loved game but still this is too much the show is at mediocre at his best its too past paced forced dialoguesno emotion the action is almost non existent and acting is mediocre except pedro pascal which tries his best despite the low end script and forgive me but bellas ramsey acting performance its a sad joke and not because she cant act but she is not the right actor casted for ellie i am sorry but to say this is a masterpiece its a nonsense go see the red wedding episode from game of throne the day will come when you wont be from the walking dead
2,i love the colors of this dress and i waited for the sale since it isnt really good for work i wear size in hd all the time but this one doesnt fit at all on the top the bust is cut for someone really curvy but the bottom is for someone really straight i dont know what they were using for a model but this has to be tried on before purchased the material is also rough and there is no lining to protect you from that i love my hd dresses for style and functionality but this one is j
2,my personal opinion is that i am not a fan of this top the material of the fabric doesnt seem as nice as delettas other tops and it had a really boxy fit on me i wanted to love this top but i did not
2,you can adjust this dress a bit with the straps but its huge the colors were also a bit grayish which i didnt expect
2,i bought this in the blue and really wanted to like iti had plans to check sizing and then order it again in the red as well however this skirt falls victim to the recent design trend of using a pattern for a structured skirt but substituting a softer fabric and horrors an elastic waistband this ended up just looking kind of cheap and sweatshirty as a result back it went
2,laptop damaged after a month display not strong for normal usage dont but this product otherwise you loss your money waste product
2,i saw online great quality sweater dress reviews about seemingly extra fabric easy fix with a seamstress i have very sensitive skin and wear long sleeves under sweaters wool angora mohair xsp tts lengtharms but lots of extra fabric for width just trying it on was too itchy for me
2,i like this recipe better
2,below average
2,i just finished the th episode and kept waiting for something interesting or anything to happen at all it was the most boring waste of time the whole six episodes nothing actually happens the beauty of hawaii is marred by the cringe worthy repetitive music if you can even call that music it was unbearable to listen to i kept waiting for the murder mystery part and i still cant believe nothing ever actually happens you have to wait until the final minutes of the very last episode for any action at all and wow what a disappointment that was every character is completely unlikable and the story kept preaching about social issues and politics which got really annoying i dont understand why people are raving about this
2,the dress is really frumpy standing up something about the bottom tier of lace just turns it into a frumpy mawmaw nightgown the lace is really pretty though
2,i love maeve dresses and have always gotten a lot of wear out of them while still looking great this dress does not meet those standards on the nd wear of this dress the zipper completely broke i had to take it to a dry cleaner to get replaced at a pricey cost for a pricey dress im dissapointed
2,this top is very wide and shorter than in appears in the picture it also has a strong chemical smell ive had a couple pieces with that smell in the past and the smell never washed out
2,i wanted this romper so bad after buying and loving a shirt from madewell made with the same fabric earlier this year i wish this romper was just a little bit longer and roomier i normally wear a size or and bought the large it fit me ok but i felt like i wanted it to be just a little bit more oversized around my hips and definitely wanted it to be longer in the legs retailer please stop with the capri lengths its tired if you are narrowhipped you will fare much better the fab
2,the turqoise color is pretty however it did smell bad out of the package i wore it once and it transferred the dye to my skin and white pants bra and cami hope it all comes out in the wash i tried to hand wash the shirt and now have blue hands and a blue tub
2,this is another one of those darned swing tops i cant even with this trend this shirt has such a nice printcolor palette going on but its ruined by the swing cuthenley combo it looked like i was a little kid wearing an oversized mens night shirtsmock i dont know it was just not at all flattering i ordered my regular size large and a medium would have worked and probably still been generously cut i disagree with a reviewer who said it might work for larger sizes this just made my
2,i purchased this in the yellow for my daughter and she has not seen it yet the style is very cute but the fabric is quite thin she will have to make that call but if i had bought it for myself it would be going back im not willing to wear a camisole under a tshirt it also feels like the kind of knit fabric that shrinks and skews when its washed so that remains to be seen
2,i ordered this since it looked so cute on the model when i it arrived i was excited to try it on but when i didblah the color is murky and the top runs large not to mention that the material is too heavy for a short sleeved top plus its lined i really wanted to like it and debated wetting it and then putting it in the dryer to shrink it a bit in the end i decided that it wasnt worth it too bad as the concept was a good one it just failed in the execution
2,loved this top online but when i tried it on it was shorter than expected so only fitting for high waisted bottoms and much more boxy than it appeared online i wish to high heaven that this top came in a more normal cut hip length and slimming the fabric and collar are beautiful
2,the first time i wore it felt wonderful had it cleaned and then the back end stated pilling very disappointed with the price and quality wish i could return for my money back sad
2,hands down one of the best ive seen in many years story lines action drama and cliff hangers are amazing the whole show makes you want to move out there to the scenic areas costner reilly and hauser are the hands down stars of the show with out giving any spoilers just wait till the ending of season
2,this dress runs so large why did they not make an extra small the material and detail are great the flow in the back is different but is flattering i wish wish that they made this in the extra small i was swimming in it there was no way to fix it so it went back
2,i ordered the xl in white for fit its true to size it matches the models photos its a comfortable top the shape is good with the pleating but the color is definitely off its as if the white fabric was prewashed with navy its not the fresh crisp white shown at least for the one i received the quality of the material is basic the black version might be the better one overall im going to exchange the white one i have to give that a try overall i dont think its worth ful
2,the fabric clung to my body i expected it to flow and be breezy it was too flimsy the arms were too wide and overall for this dress didnt cut the mustard im the dress was long enough just didnt flow very well
2,these instructions are not clear for a first time baker
2,i was really wanting a nice white summer blouse to pair with patterned skirts unfortunately this fell short as it was huge not only was it big it flared at the bottom it would be perfect if i was sporting a baby bump but not what i am going for right now if the tank was a bit slimmer i would have kept it as a tunicim sad that ill have to return it
2,this plays like a s john wayne movie where the hero is the allamerican boy next door pure of heart and kills only bad guys he is invincible just an average guy not a super hero in spandex or with special powers he saves damsels and animals in distress and has a heart of gold the plot for the series is a bit convoluted the special effects are gory but relevant to the plot the action is fast paced and there are a few surprises it is a very entertaining series that keeps viewers engaged the best thing about it is the complete lack of wokeness that is so pervasive in many of the current series
2,after i inserted the micro sd card to the adapter i can no longer removed it from the adapter it was stuck inside the adapter permanently i definitely received a defective item i also read a lot of reviews saying this card have bad sectorsanother while i was transferring from my computer the transferring of files suddenly stopped and said there was an errorsandisks quality control department should up their game theyre selling products to the general public that are defective and flawed not all of them but a lot of them its just not me i also read a lot of reviews saying the card they got were also defective
2,so i want to start off by saying the quality of this shirt really was great as was the pattern unfortunately if youre going off the picture know that they definitely pinned in the sides on the model this shirt has a full on triangle shape and flares significantly towards the bottom its not a straight fit as the picture would suggest im sure this works for some women but if youre muscular with an already vshape to your body meaning your shoulders are significantly sized and you have
2,this top is very cute and if you are short you will love it i am tall and the dividing line of color block kept rising up over my bust so it looked weird it made it look like an ill fitting maternity top had to go back
2,i ordered these pants after seeing the good reviews but i dont agree these are going back i ordered a small im and pounds i am usually between a small and a medium in pants but the small in these pants is huge i could definitely fit into an xs but i also dont think they are very flattering and dont like the feel of the fabric its too bad i love the idea of these
2,this is the best star wars since the originals i grew up with the originals and i am overall a bit well a lot skeptical to disney buying lucasfilm and releasing a new star wars film every year but this you have to love
2,so i have had to return this once so far because the stitching ripped out when i sat down the little slip thing that goes underneath if cheaply made i really wish this were just lined dress i wear it with a blank tank top and leggings underneath not worth the money but i needed something to wear that was transitional
2,i bought this top thinking i would wear this and feel like i was part of some fashion week but its cut way too large that i felt like a football player this top is made for women with small shoulders and a super petite frame also the cut is way too big i was swimming in this
2,overall super processed very soft nice light great melodies but engine is so loud cant relax our child and after the other reviews i adjust myself to the fact that it will break quickly really a pity related to brand and price
2,only for internet browsing like a tablet comparison of windows not satisfied and waste of money poor display but battery backup is awesome
2,tastes too much like cake and not cornbread has a good flavor but if you are looking for cornbread this doesnt really do the trick
2,i love this dress as far as the fit goes it makes my curvy figure loook even better with how its cut that being said the different patterns over each boob made the dress look crazy it makes you look quite lopsided in the chest wasnt just me but my store people also agreed had the pattern on the chest been the same it would be great but even though my boobs are of mostly equal size they looked too crazy its quite noticeable on so sad
2,honestly i returned this the reviews were great but for bucks this is like any other toy that makes sounds to my baby it didnt phase him and like what other reviewers said if you lightly touch the stomach it stops playing music and stuff so it just sat next to him eh
2,i loved this dress when i saw it online perfect for a summer wedding but when i tried it on i was very disappointed the fabric and styling are gorgeous and very high quality but the sheer amount of fabric on this dress is just not as pictured there is layer after layer of silk and ruffle and while lovely it made me look very large i tried tying the belt many ways to no avail sadly it will have to go back it may look good on a very thin frame but didnt complement my average one
2,battery backup is not as promised it runs only hours
2,very tastybut next time i will double the sauce to make it creamier i also added tsp of thyme to give it extra flavor
2,i love the design of this top however its quality is lackluster the shirt is pretty short and would be more flattering at least on me if it had a few more inches also its pretty sheer so figuring out under garments is a dilemma i will still wear it because i love it looks great with a denim vest over it
2,i felt its over priced i had issue on power button quality also not to dell perfection battery performance not much expected
2,followed recipe as written not enough pumpkin flavor more like cake than bars probably wont make again
2,the product is ok but my card does not acheive the rated write speed of mbsec most applications probably dont need to hit mbsec but my gopro hero does need the full bandwidth and thus would bomb on me sometimes as tested my card got between mbsec using the larger block sizes i complained to sandisk about it and they allowed me to send it in for a replacement which i did and took almost weeks but the replacement behaved the same way i would say this card is ok for most applications but if you need top end speed i would go with another card i bought my card in may and had it replaced in august so hopefully they have fixed this problem by now
2,i wish i had read the other review about the color of the pink version of this sweater before i ordered it she was absolutely right the color is completely different in person it is this garish pink and brown that looks like it was knit together with remaindered yarn its too bad because the cut of the sweater is cute and the zipper adds a funky touch maybe the blue is better in person
2,im and lbs and i was swimming in the small the arms are very boxy the sleeves too long and and it just wasnt a flattering fit at all the color and design on the front are both nice the sweater is made in china and very very itchy i own wool sweaters and wear them with layers but there was no way this was going to be comfortable very disappointed especially given the price but perhaps thats why there are so many left at the end of the season and on sale this one is going bac
2,what is going on with maeve sizing this season in the past two months ive purchased two maeve dresses that run very smallparticularly at the waist having many maeve items from past seasons and other recent retailer purchases its impossible to ignore that maeves sizing is quite off that aside the vibrant summer colors and material quality are great the skirt is lined but billowy and fuller than ideal strangely its a lot of dress yet not enough at the same time there bodice h
2,well i wanted to love it and it was just too much i think it is a bit wider and weirdly baggier than it should be i also feel it should be fully lined it was not the exterior wool and pattern is very nice maybe if it was lined a smaller size would have worked better but for the price i needed more i also would have liked some sort of option for tightening the waist a bit when zipped up i realize this isnt in the picture so no expectation but upon trying it on and seeing its boxines
2,way too big and had a granny like styling was very excited but ultimately took it back
2,i really wanted to love this dress i love the colors and the design of the dress unfortunately i have to agree with one of the other reviewers that this dress makes you look pregnant its so voluminous that its not flattering at all also agree that the lining is scratchy
2,slow
2,too full of a dress for me i tried a belt and it is then too chunky if you are younger tall and slim this would look great
2,you cant argue with the power of the original story and first series but im not convinced subsequent series arent an attempt to cash in on success i started watching the second series but have actually stopped that doesnt mean i dont miss some of the continuing powerful aspects elizabeth moss is always intensely watchable and in the commander and aunt lydia we have two of the most loathsome characters ever created on the small screen aunt lydia is especially hard to forget the most evil of women the scriptwriters loved her character so much they made her appear in so many situations we start to lose track of likelihood she is in many ways the embodiment in gilead of the daleks in dr who she pops up in all sorts of totally implausible situations looks almost quaint and cute at times and then lets everyone see the coldness of her heart and the little alien mind within she even moves a bit like a dalek and often carries a daleklike electrical prod
2,the cut is small i am lbs and usually wear medium pants medium in these is too fitted on my hips and rearthe polyester will be hot in summer returning for another brand
2,imo this is the worst sw spin off you have to watch boring episodes to then get to decent one and then the pattern starts again not for me at all this one and yes i quite liked obi wan they really drag out the story line to try and make it stretch out to the full series the concept is there bit for me the lack of any action makes it difficult to concentrate on each episode as someone else said you reach for your phone about times during an episode the acting is ok the dialogue i sometimes find a bit too quiet so im adjusting the volume several times in some episodes overall like i say imo its the worst spin off to date
2,i remember watching and appreciating the adams family with christina ricci as a kid no i havent seen the original and dont care about the comparisons anyway i went into this one with no expectations and was not disappointed there were good references but the writer director and cast made this their own story and did a phenomenal job it sucked me right in with the incredible cast and characters along with the murder mystery definitely some twists and turns to keep you on your toes plenty of dark humor and great dialogue i really enjoyed seeing the growth in some of the characters as well i flew through the season faster than expected suffice it to say wednesday kept my attention cant wait for more seasons
2,alas i so wanted to love this the photos of the models wearing it look gorgeous flowy drapey ultimate grecian goddess but it just doesnt work unless youre superskinny too much material almost bulky strange looking the print is so beautiful i love the pink floral and i love the whole idea of the dress but it just doesnt work have to send it back im pounds and i ordered a
2,i used it for something like months in my galaxy s iii gti with original firmware mainly for pictures and flac filessuddenly i perceived that the last pictures i took disappeared i took some more pictures as i thought that were software problems but same problem until i realized that the card was not working now i cant write it anymore or delete information format it delete partition etc now is a rom the bright side is that i did not lose valuable information like pictures that now are permanently stored in the card
2,i cant understand the seemingly manic positive reviews this show is a second rate soap opera masquerading as some kind of socially conscious advert geez nothing better to remember great locations great actors ridiculous story predictable and trite pendantic and boring if this is the golden age of television then somebody forgot to alert these writers of this is to continue i would hope that perhaps someone who had lived a real life gets a say in the next script and removes all the bs from the story and makes it less days of our lives and more this is reality its hard to sympathize with idiots that are portrayed on this show
2,first of all it arrived rolled in a tight ball the size of a large starbucks coffee i dont know why they do that youre not going to be immediately impressed by something that is packaged like its cheap second im usually a in retailer and mine is no where near as loosefitting as the photo also he sleeves and back are a very thin waffle knit like a flimsy tshirt and seethru the sleeves formfit to my arms so i couldnt layer under it but i couldnt wear it alone with the fa
2,loved this online but the xs was too big and the material was too bulky
2,so the otter is super cute and i thought it would be a real companion for our son unfortunately it quickly broke of course after you could have sent it backthe breathing function no longer works and makes mechanical noises it should imitate the breathing movement but it is stuckwould everything have worked the otter at least stars from us
2,i didnt like the the fact that it was thickened first i do that at the end soup was too hot trying to get the spuds done and when i added the cheese it broke looked yucky and no one ate the leftovers garbage can is happy i guess
2,i brought this shirt for a vacation it fitted well and was flattering totally a comfortable wear however after wash on delicate hang dry small holes appeared near the bottom i am hoping i can return it not worth the money
2,battery problem only one hour backup
2,this colors and fabric of this dress are beautiful and i really wanted to love it but from the chest to the hips there is too much fabric and it give you no shape at all it had to go back
2,i was so excited to order this top it looked like it was made of more sturdy soft cotton but sadly after receiving it today i found that to not be true its incredibly sheer youd have to wear a cami underneath which defeated the point for me the pleating in the front hides your bra but you can see it from all other angles i tried it on with an unlined nude lace bra which can easily hide under sheer clothing i was hoping to be able to wear it on its own without a cami and for it to
2,not satisfied problem there is heating issue when working with excel and power bi i could hear the fan noise and when we touch the speaker area there was heating this is not a single experience problem the key in the keyboard is rigid you have to press it hard to type this might be problem for mine only experiencing this on a brand new laptop is not acceptable so overall im not satisfied
2,after reading the glowing reviews i was excited to buy this on sale im tall and lean but found the dress looked slightly awkward and off on me compared to the model pictures firstly the top has a strange transition to the skirt with extra fabric you have to either blouse over the skirt or bunch together if you blouse it and lay flat it invariably gets bunched as you wear it this bunching changes the aesthetics of the color blocks creating less clean lines i also found the blue black
2,bought this based off the reviews here but this was a miss for me the colors werent as vibrant as pictured and the waist in this dress is huge not flattering and it went back i buy an retailer dress every week so i just exchanged this one for another one i loved not hard to do at all
2,the design is gorgeous the fit is great and the fabric drapes beautifully and is very comfortable however its extremely see thru
2,this is what i would call regressed preppy its safe insular and fluffy yet violent erotic and toxic that thing where it simultaneously feels like a very young childrens tv show and an xrated movie a very jarring experience with continuous whiplash just totally caught off guard by the combination its spongebob squarepants meets freddy kruger its like being immersed in an identity crisis wanting to be perceived as sweet soft and innocent yet that repressed wild side and agenda cant help but peek through it makes for a very calculated experience which is totally unimmersive for example you can just tell that they used white coded passing bullies in that overcorrectionovercompensating see were not biased way then you can see how they specifically actively put a black coded passing bully for another scene as a way to balance it out andor stick to their comfortable biased routine or how the characters keep emphasizing how white wednesday is which is just poorly cloaked casteism wednesday might as well ask a mirror who the fairest of them all is then you have the questionable romancesocial plots which almost seem to normalize or glorify toxic behavior you know rude for no reason zero empathy yet is still supposed to be likable and is liked by others or instalove type of stuff its starting to become disturbing and not in a good way other than that its just very predictable and flat entertainment due to the approach the lore tone and aesthetic is just superficial wrapping on another typical teen drama with flat trope characters and identity cult propaganda the woman cultism was in full effect men are devil except love interests perfect female protagonist has unlimited skills abilities and knowledge and wispywaifyskinny character with little to no muscle tone can beat up anyone typically a male the over reliance on formula is also clear i mean a werewolf character that says this kitty has claws just because it has been used successfully before in other media and vaguely correlates since when were retractable claws the weapons of werewolves fangs would of made more sense or why not just make them say this puppy has claws or make them a werecat instead they just put tropes cliches and formulas in a blender without a lid and used whatever flew out it can also been seen in how wednesday literally talks in wry sarcastic macabre come backs were talking of wednesdays lines and that is zero exaggeration lastly the exposition why are you using all of the dialogue to explain to the audience what is currently happening right in front of our faces dialogue is there to weave a story and express characters not to talk down to us this is just a magic mirror for the matching demographic light featured dainty logicalsocialite women and the latinx womenother women that aspire to be them which is what all shows are becoming chosen one simulators at least if it wasnt your vibe or matching demographic it was watchable but now its just so bludgeoning obstructive and exclusionary if youre the matching demographic you may enjoy it and why not as i said most demographics seem to be doing it but what happened to stories character flaws and creativity instead of riskfree formulas decadent self worship and identity cult propaganda
2,ive been using this moisturiser daily for years and its always been great for the price however a recent formula change means that it now stings slightly to apply and has caused dermatitis to flare up around my eyes ive compared the ingredients from before and think its possibly due to the inclusion of bromonitropropanediol dissapoiting as was always super reliable before even for my picky skin hopefully theyll change the formula back otherwise i wont be buying it again
2,didnt have much flavorbut i did add hot salsa to give it more kick
2,not value for money
2,beautiful print however as the previous reviewer mentioned it is very sheer much sheerer than the product shot shows i was expecting to be able to wear a nude bra under this without a cami however my nude bra was completely visible the top also ended at the middle of the zipper of my jeans so much shorter than the tunic length shown and the bottom half of the sleeves ballooned out much more noticeably in person the top half of the sleeves are slim and the bottom half are looser over
2,i very much enjoyed the first few series of this an interesting and entertaining plot well produced and superbly directed sadly this is a series which is rapidly going downhill due to its popularity clearly they are stretching this out for all its worth the peaky blinders are increasingly involved in every significant moment in history i would not be surprised if the next series involves a flashback of how the peaky blinders were in fact crucial to the norman conquest of id give the first few series an the latest a
2,i was really disappointed with this particularly after reading all the rave reviews i wont make the filling again because it was tasteless even after adding spices and didnt set right but i will be using the crust recipe a recipe for the next pie i make perhaps that will turn out betterreserving just a cup for topping left the crust really thick so i reserved about cup which turned out nicely i used different kinds of apples to get a flavor blend and sprinkled some cinnamon and nutmeg on the bottom crust before putting the apple mixture in unfortunately this still didnt really give the filling any flavor i was amazed at how thick the watercornstarchsugar mixture got after boiling but it was really jellylike when i took it out of the oven i was worried that it wouldnt set as it cooled and it didnt reallyi will say though that every toh pie recipe i read calls for a pie dish but every one i make needs a deep dish pan dont believe what you read in the recipe it doesnt fit in the smaller dish
2,i loved the first season of this show and i still enjoy the show but goddam is kelly reily over the top in this show her character is getting to be laughable and distracting at this point and considering her role is getting bigger and bigger its legitimately hurting the series speaking to her character her love story is also becoming a bigger narrative in the series so i end up watching an episode made up half of her romance and over acting
2,i absolutely loved the patterns and colors of this skirt if only the cut wasnt so odd the sides of the skirt wing out for a very distracting and unflattering look the stiff feltlike quality of the material only makes matters worse in that respect the model photos are not at all accurate it also runs large i had to go down one full size
2,white and silver threads made fabric look grey almost dirty fit was nice and price is great villa to pool to restaurant would be great colored fabric would be better
2,first of all the original star wars was a galactic science fiction film series made for adults yes there were lighter elements added to the narrative but all played out as if it was real jon favreau has tried to do pretty much the same but it seems the audience has been rerooted to cater for kids yearolds or thereabouts apart from that the scripts are serious lowgrade work the acting and dialogue you wouldnt even see in amateur dramatics as if nobody took an acting course the only plus point of all this less than mediocre work is the special effects thats why i gave it two stars
2,visuallythank you for the stunning cinematography the pacing had that perfect edging tensionslow builds drawnout anticipation and just the right moments of release the waterscapes and foam shots were especially gorgeouslike visual waves teasing the shoreline pulling back just before they crash it felt like gooning made cinematic hypnotic immersive and evenly spaced throughout whether intentional or a stroke of serendipity this season stands out as one of your best if this was the tease then the next season is bound to hit like a whiff of poppersracing the heart dilating the senses and driving the audience with a pulsating rhythm toward a euphoric wellearned happy ending
2,i thought it was going to be so pretty it is ugly on the macrame is thick stiff and rough the top fits awkward on top where the macrame is and the rest is shapeless yuk
2,usually wear s and xs tried this in s at store but the sides were still lumpy after zipping the size zipper up if i tried xs it would have looked better but may be bit too tight the sides of the arm holes were also cut very low it also has a dusty grey sheen to it that makes it look like old velvet in a bad way two layers green on outside and a polyester beige layer underneath but definitely a showpiece that can be paired with a short jacket
2,the item arrive in time but was unfortunately defective as it would not accept a copy operation further investigation led to discovering the card had bad sectors refund is progressing without a hitch however so not all was lost
2,the acting is just horrendous and so is the writing i hate bad exposition or really exposition in general for those who dont know what that is its when writers give characters dialogue to deliver a speech or something similar to introduce information that they dont have time to show because of budget time or laziness this is when they explain the plot or give a bunch of information about a character we need information but it has to be done in a subtle and natural way so we never notice the exposition and there are ways of doing it if you have the right writer who has the talent to do so this isnt it i also dont think ortega has the charm of the original wednesday or even riccis portrayal of her in the movie adaptation the humor doesnt land tim burton to me has mostly created artificial worlds where the characters deliver lines that feel like a wink to the camera very hammy and over the top its just hard to watch like a singer that is offkey if you are tonedeaf you dont notice it anyway i guess there are just so many bad films and tv shows out that the remotely engaging ones get praise despite not deserving it sorta a blown opportunity if you are into long boring remake shows that dont bring much new this is for you
2,i found this soup so bland and runny i even used pepper jack instead of cheddar i dont understand what all the raves were about not yummy just boring
2,i love this shirt love love love it i am a curvy girl and it accents all the right features and hides the ones that need to be hidden but ive owned it for months and there are already holes in the shirt and not holes in the fabric but holes on the seam lines the stitching is not sturdy enough for the shirt to not fall apart the whole point is to be able to wear it but now i have to bust out my sewing machine to reinforce the seams that split so that i can wear it again
2,i had high hopes for this top but sadly it was not meant to be it was tts im and usually wear a small but the material was horribly scratchy both the body of the top as well as the sleeves and the design isnt all that flattering it made me look really wide at the bottom and i definitely am not in real life
2,this skirt is very pretty but not only does it run small but only a small portion of the waistband is elasticized so theres very little stretch for those of us with a significant difference in our waist and hip measurements theres no way to get this skirt on past the hips
2,again nope looks chic on the model looked like a floorlength flannel nightgown on me if youd put a bonnet on me and stuck a candlestick in my hand i could double for ebenezer scrooge in a christmas carol i believe the word i used to describe it when i tried it on was shmata yiddish for rags it looked like i was wearing a rag the ruching didnt do anything to flatter my figure the knit did not seem terribly warm for a sweater felt more like rayon or nylon jersey than a knit swe
2,not satisfied with this
2,tried this dress in a small i am lbs c the small was huge the sash helped some but looked like a potato sack on me also i noticed the fabric was piling slighly in the store i had high hopes for this dress but left this one in the store
2,i could not find one character to like or hope it turns out well for they only people i disliked more were the writers of this woke crapi gave it a four stars for the beautiful scenery
2,i fell in love with this cute top however after reading reviews i am going to return it seems there is a problem with it shrinking after following washing instructions who wants to dry clean a tank top not me sadly too bad style was cute and color was awesome
2,i did not like the fit of this as another reviewer stated it is not a swing tunic it hangs fairly straight i dont have large hips im and lbs with a full bust and this did not look flattering i returned it immediately
2,tom cruise was no jack reacher this is the jack reacher character brought to life hard and gritty take no prisoners and leave no bad guys alive this is a great show i hope there will be more to come
2,well christmas is just around the corner and to get the happy nostalgic old time feeling for the grown up kids this is the series i was just glued to it and only complain i had was why only episodes well i know that is why it is this goodduh but still the storyline awesome the acting of each one out of the world the suspense wow acting of these kids were so good i wonder what impact they will have when they grow up this is kind of series one can sit together with whole family with some munchies and hot cocoa in a cold winter day and enjoy i guess if you watch it now you will again want to watch it once you run out of feel good series again
2,this is one fabulouslooking dress however the really scratchy neckline at the lace edge was a dealbreaker for me i even tried sizing up to see if that would help but it was still too scratchy for me
2,so after reading all of the many raves about this i thought for sure it would be better then the banana bread recipe that i already have it was not it was moist on the inside but way too hard on the outside i did use lemon juice and milk instead of buttermilk and i just used bananas like the recipe called for rather then the three that many of you recommended perhaps that is why mine did not turn out so great
2,very bad experience with flipkart delivered a defected laptop please dont purchase it because service is very poor and not replacing this defected laptop but hp is done the doa certificate but still not listing any things
2,best way for me to describe it it was interesting enough as far as a plot went it had a goosebumps vibe wednesday was a great character unlikeable and likable despite being a czj fan she fell flat as morticia but those are big spiked heels to fill morticias character wasnt written well the makeup was awful she looked sick but not in the way they intended i love how they showcase christies height she looked lovely in every scene sunday looked amazing in every scene the dance scene was great worth a watch all in all not a bad series not my favorite tim burton but enjoyable
2,struggle to open the lid then it spills every time i try to use the cap as a measure terrible design product itsel is fine but would avoid buying because of the irritation with the lid
2,this is just the perfect star wars is back we were craving for something good since return of the jedi and this is the result of itloved itepic
2,for the price of this dress i was expecting something decent the style is cute but nothing more however the type of the polyester that the dress is made of oh my it is a thick unpleasant material that will cling to a body when it is hot i never came across an item at retailer that was made this cheaply the tag on the back was hanging at half and the button on the front was ready to come off before i even tried this dress on no need to say its going back asap you should not sel
2,while i thought it looked really pretty on the hanger when i tried it on it just felt like a mess perhaps it suits other personalities and bodies i hated that the zipper was in the front i personally find it tacky and gawdy while the patterns are pretty the material felt like some weird fabric wallpaper and i didnt see how the price was justified with how the material felt cheap to me
2,if youre going to change characters to this degree make new characters i dont understand the drastic changes to wellestablished and beloved characters weve been seeing in hollywood for some time now theres nothing wrong with taking inspiration but taking liberties such as the ones seen in this show is in my opinion as a huge fan of the addams family completely unacceptable i dont see how any fan of the addams could enjoy it unless you completely separate it from every other version as though it existed in some alternate universe as much as i hope hollywood will get the message im not optimistic
2,c ports are not workings
2,not a tunic unless the model pictured is barely covered my backside and not as advertised design on top is interesting and the fabric is soft so its a good buy if off or more
2,ive used this product for years and its always worked well i recently bought it and it had a new fragrance which wasnt made obvious and i didnt really like it doesnt offer me the same sweat protection had i known i wouldnt have bought it
2,we did not enjoy this casserole my family all agreed that our alltime favorite egg casserole by jimmy dean is much better
2,i am using this laptop from last week dont buy this laptop its to slow if you are using app or you want to switch to another its take minute to load if you have money for this laptop give it to needy people but dont buy this laptop
2,you should use milk not egg white to brush on the pie crust pie crust edges do not need to be covered with foil until the end if theyre browning too quickly time given is not long enough to cook the filling it needs twice as long as stated here it also needs a higher starting temperature it should be baked at degrees for the first minutes then turned down to degrees to bake for a further minutes or so also i used bramley apples and it came out a bit tart so id increase the sugar and also the flour and it is liquidy
2,i usually love maeve and generally feel like everything they make was made for me sadly this dress is a definite exception which could easily have been solved by changing the construction of the dress as other reviewers stated the dress does run small but even if you size up if you have any breasts at all the dress will pull at the buttons causing them to gape im only a b cup so not on the large side im pretty sure this is why the model has her arms crossed in the picture i love
2,this is the star wars that those of us who were there from the beginning has been waiting on for a long time yes there are no jedi this still felt more like star wars then the last triliogy did by a long shot rogue one i felt like was the best movie since return of the jedi and this show plays off of that wonderfully great writing and great performances by all i loved the fact that we got episodes instead of the usual episodes i also loved the fact that they were fairly long episodes as well the best part was there are not any filler episodes in the series every episode leads up to the fantastic ending to season i cant wait for season and this should be the blue print going forward
2,color is not like photo and fit doesnt work if youre busty
2,good quality fabric and structure but the mix media details and lines make them seem more like jodphurs than leggings its hard to see where i would wear them sorry but they have to go back
2,i ordered this and hoped it would be a fun whimsical sweater for this winter instead its just strange it didnt fit well too short in the overall length in the sleeves the shades of the yarn were drab it also didnt seem made to last it looked like it would pillsnag in a short amount of time i returned it id love to see a style similar to this executed better in the future having a unique sleeve is a cute idea
2,display quality very bad
2,wasnt expecting an addams family spin off the be my thing considering none of the addams family shows films id seen down the years would get my recommendation as something worthy of your time this is ortega was a new actress to me but i am a fan now wednesdays sardonic character and deadpan delivery chimed beautifully as she delivers her brand of honesty to all those around the school of unusual children could be a bit harry potter and the mystery a bit scoobydoo and the plot a bit predictable but dont let it put you off the most important thing was that it put a smile on my face and kept me entertained and that ill be back for season
2,this didnt work for me it looks better unzipped the piece made me look extremely top heavy and i am by no means overweight but i do have a larger chest on a small frame c feet honestly it just made me look fat the design is cute but this is going back
2,bro sound is low
2,bought this shirt online wanted to love it but just couldnt i ordered the xs and it was huge and way too unstructured for my stylejust didnt have enough shape had to send it back
2,they have given us a taste of how a life stripped of any rights might look like and i a can say foe myself its horrifying to be frank i didnt knew there was a previous title and so i decided to watch that too from where i stand it was not that different but what in think was that when it was filmed no one would have thought that the problems that were greatly exaggerated would become true one day pollution population and infant mortality are real problems and we must deal with it before a real gilead appears
2,i agree with the previous reviewer that this shirt is way to sheer at least for me if you dont mind wearing a cami under it or your bra and skin showing in the back especially then it might be for you i did not feel like it was very good quality either the print is really cute but then it did not button all the way up and i like the option because i think they drape better when they have buttons to the top wether you choose to button up
2,darling jacketcoat similar styling as the beige with big flowers and laceup back that i bought a few years ago and still love i was considering this one but the description says to hand wash seriously a coat thats simply not practical not sure if i will buy this one
2,this sweater is adorable and comfortable but the poms are barely secured so they just pop off whenever they rub up against anything i cannot even imagine trying to wash it unfortunately i will reluctantly be returning it because the construction is very poor
2,disappointing all you could taste was citrus not sure what i am going to do with the leftover chicken now as it wasnt enjoyed
2,its been a while since i last saw a serie that tickled my inner child i had so much fun watching this for all the reviews that said the plot wasnt too great or they were dissapointed in some way brighten up o wait wednesday wouldnt like that uhm dont get so emotional i thought the decor clothing music characters and the acting was so enjoyable and i was not expecting that at all what a nice surprise i will be waiting for a next dark fun season with wednesday and thing who else would like to have a thing in their bag every step of the way to organise birthday parties for you and do make up tutorials with
2,worst sound quality
2,i loved the cut of these pants and the button accent on the pockets however the material was quite thin and the quality was not great there were multiple snags along the seams additionally at lbs i was swimming in the size i would have tried sizing down if the quality was better
2,this cake was delicious had a lot of trouble with the frosting as would not set up with all that butter kept it in the refrigerator to keep it intact if i make it again will certainly change the frosting recipe
2,this dress was cute in the photos but wore like a sack when i put it on great quality fabric was lovely just a little sparkle at the hemline scallops were great but i put it on i immediately took it back off and put it back in the sack to return love the look it just was terrible on me im petite and weigh so im not large but the dress made me look like an oompaloompa
2,these could barely fit over my calf and did not even broach my knee i have big calves but i am otherwise i slim and normal sized woman these are way too tight and narrow to enjoy or to get much use out of
2,episode is such a fun jump into this new part of the universe we get some really interesting ideas and mysteries setting up the rest of the season and some amazingly fun star wars action scenes sets and characters for the st episode of a star wars show you cant ask for much more
2,got this in the sky color returned it because the top is way too sheer for me if you know what i mean i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids no can do also for the price material just felt flimsy cheap it does run small the medium was good on me and im b
2,such a pretty fall sweater nice fit wore it once out shopping and it snagged had to return sadly
2,the top is cute but when i received it it did not feel like cotton the tag says viscose i hope retailer can be more accurate with fabric content in the future on the plus side the return was no problem
2,great color soft fabric but waaaaay too long more like a night shirt than a tshirt
2,this show is barely a something to throw on in the background and shut your brain off because its not really worth paying attention to im being generous because sometimes i like that kind of thing
2,sleeves were tight was difficult to put on for the price you want to love the shirt sending it back
2,i was looking for an oversized silhouette but this is more like a beach coverup the waist does not have elastic or any structure the top fabric is crossed over but not sewn closed and because the fit is so loose it just gaps open the fabric is nice quality but i am returning
2,i wanted to love this sweater the photo of the model makes it look so soft and warm i liked the heavy texture and the extra long sleeves however after receiving this sweater i tried it on for less than minute one look in the mirror was enough to make me take it off and return it asap the knit quickly expanding from small to large right over the bust combined with the boxy shape was an atrocious combo it must have added lbs to my physique and made my bust look matronly yikes this ma
2,for reference i am lbs with an hourglass figure and my usual small fit perfectly the problems this skirt is not black but a charcoal graypurple the sipper is reinforces with a stiff boarder on the inside so no matter where i put the waist it sticks straight out making me look like i have a tail under my skirt in other words i had a very pointy butt also the slit or tulip part of the skirt goes all the way up to the waist it needed to be tacked to the other part of the skir
2,the bra is comfortable and the design is good however the sizing is way off i am a c and the small fits well with minimal support not sure about quality this one might have to go back
2,i ordered this in a small petite and medium petite and i am a huge fan of ak i put tried on the sp while it fit it was very long even for a petite what i hated about it was that the piping on the top made me look very wide even a long necklace wouldnt help deter the look on a positive side the blue was a very nice cool color i am usually a small to medium in ak in tops and the small fit well in the armsbodice just too much fabric for me returning
2,i purchased the blue with white dots the shape was awful but looked like a sack returned
2,my family usually loves mexican food but neither my husband nor i cared for it at all i was very disappointed
2,this a great skirt for someone with a straight or boyish figure this skirt does not accommodate a curvy figure small waist feminine hips
2,ill make the similarities with succession yellowstone has more action especially around the cattle rustling scenes there is also more violence physical and guns youll see characters with bruised facesand worse actually i probably should be comparing with peaky blinders both shows push the boundaries of gritiness and arent afraid to put their characters into dire physical and mental situations now back to succession succession is cleverer and focuses solely on the rich family yellowstone does spend time with the cowboys and actually the show is better when it does as these are some excellent characters yellowstone is also more soap opery than succession up to you whether that is good or not also need to mention kelly reillys character beth dutton she is one of the best female characters on television at the moment i know that the scenery isnt really montana but it is really spectacular and gives the show a cinematic feel i was expecting this to be a bit like longmire but other than both being modern westerns there isnt really much similarity
2,my cake turned out heavy and didnt rise i loved the frosting but i obviously did something wrong as it was not fluffy but more solid like the texture of clay
2,display is not good
2,ref g i dont think this is for us shorter women this hits you right where you dont want a vertical line to hit it flares out at your hip and makes you look shorter than you are the fabric is like a double gauze and very soft and the colors are beautiful but i couldnt even dream of making this work i thought maybe with my larger bust it would create shape but it looks like i just wrapped a bunch of fabric around me glad i tried instore and didnt online order
2,this dress had so much potential but the horizontal knit ruined it i tried on size xxs in grey since my usual petite xxs size was not available the fabric was a good weight and dress was well constructed however the wide horizontal knit made the dress bulge out at places especially in the lower body thus made me look wide and bulky i wish they had used a cable knit pattern which will make the dress drape much more nicely and more flattering
2,just okay its your average banana bread
2,very poor product
2,its super cute and this would be great but the motor makes this loud squeaking sound and has the very first time i turned it on changed the batteries and that didnt work for the amount of money it was im pretty disappointed
2,i bought both colors based on the reviews and really like the prints however they are too sheer i dont want to wear a tank top but you have to with these tops since they are so sheer i can also see the fabric tearing easily it is too delicate i sent both colors back what a waste because the prints and colors are good these tops are also not for busty ladies i have a big bust and the top part didnt cover my entire bust and was awkward because the division between the fabrics would st
2,honestly the show is fantastic i wasnt aware of it coming and but when i seen it i thought it will be typical addams family show but we got soo much more while some people may want to see the rest of the family you need to keep in mind the show focuses on wednesday and her journey honestly the humour and horror is perfectly balanced where we really get to enjoy the show the costumes are phenomenal and the crew did a great job on them as to the story it moves at a great pace and is really interesting leaving you wanting more tim burton really added his creative touch to this series and i can only hope this will be a long running series as the possibilities are endless as to where they can take the story i hope it runs for a good few year with many seasons but i must say jenna ortega is absolutely perfect as wednesday her acting is absolutely perfect and she captures the character like no other to be fair all of the cast are acting really well which makes the show all that more enjoyable highly recommend the show and hope to see more seasons in the future
2,i love the shirt and it runs true to size everywhere but the arm holes i bought a size small and the length was great the fit was great but the arm holes were gappy and big i had to return it and was bummed because i loved it otherwise
2,heating problem hm so im editing this review after days of using it and i saw that the heating problem will be okay with the timei mean not overall but heat will be less if your is too heating so have patience use it for days and then it will be normal because heating is a normal problem in laptops but overheating is not i think its good at tis range just okay
2,im towards the end of season three and to be honest i was ready to give up on the show like others have posted it did begin to drag episodes became tedious and difficult to watch i found myself fast forwarding through certain parts when it looked like one monologue close up or slow march after another then things took a turn midway through episode and then really kicked into high gear in the th episode of season the show very quickly got entertaining again finally some excitement without giving any details away ill say the plot thickened the acting is really on point with great character development that was in part the problem bc for a long time it was only character development now its back to being story driven for those ready to give up who have endured the entirety of the nd season please dont give up you will have to bear through another episodes but it will be worth it the premise is strong bc in our day in this country the possibility is plausible we are at a very precarious place in our nations history our very democracy is at stake and this show provides a glimpse of what could be a very scary proposition indeed so in summation this is a very good show that really delves deep in character analysis to provide the viewer extensive understanding into the how and why maintaining a democracy is so difficult and most importantly how quickly it can all disappear when our politicians turn a blind eye to insurgencies and attempted coups as citizens we must hold those elected officials accountable by voting in each and every election
2,just finished watching the tv series reacher what a ride good use of the novels plot and definitely casting the right man for the lead role excellent viewing and looking forward to more series
2,such a beautiful and unique design i only wish it fit it is so so boxy im thin but would have needed almost a foot of fabric removed in order to make it look right and i dont mean making it super tight the seaming and button details on the back are such that it would be tough to have a tailor refit it appropriately so i had to return this despite really wanting to find a way to make it work
2,baking time way off im at minutes and still gooey in the middle
2,the design is very strange the inner slip is quite formfitting but the dress on top was just massive like a sack on the sides were tassels that i could not figure out what to do with they looked weird just hanging off the side so i tried to knot them like a belt overall this dress was not attractive on it looks much better on the model the coloring on the snakeskin print dress is also different in real life harsher red blue and white print not the dusty rose and plum pictured
2,super cute dress online on the model what you cant tell from the picture is the slip underneath is not true to size of the dress and the outside layer of the dress is more sheer than the picture shows so you can tell the slip underneath is very tight it might be my body type otherwise its super cute in person and i wish it wouldve fit better
2,these are a beautiful color but run large i ordered my usual size and they are falling off of me they are very low rise so i dont think ill be trying the smaller size cant even imagine them being lower also they are cropped thats hard to tell in the picture
2,rogue one nailed it and this series surely has the spirit of the old trilogy hope you keep on this track disney this is the way i have spoken
2,i wanted to love this dress it really has no style i was expecting the smocking to be fitted but it just hung i considered going down a size but i think the lining would have been too tight had to return it
2,what a piece of dreck im not saying the actors were bad they werent the acting by all of the characters was really good i didnt care about any of the characters except for belinda she was the only decent character in the show its like reading a book if you dont care about the characters you dont care about the story i watched it tortuously until the end but only because i thought i knew the ending and wanted to see how it happened i was wrong but it didnt matter
2,i only put stars because of the sound of the mechanism which is very unpleasant
2,i wanted to like this but it just didnt have much of a shape not flattering at all maybe if i was taller
2,i wont retread too much ground here mandalorian badass including his lore baby yoda cute side characters mostly suck some episodes are only held up by the merit that its star wars also i hate to do it but im gonna fireflyserenity blows this out of the airlock as a space western even with the bigger budget and flashier effects firefly had so much more going for it i cant believe that mandalorian has throwaway episodes in such a short run season shame the overall narrative is sloppy and is somewhat of a throwback to more conventional episodic storytelling there is a reason most mature tv has developed longer form story arcs for more invested viewership as much as i liked this show more than the new movies it really wasnt mustwatch for me its really tough for me to explain this im glad i watched it i was entertained for the most part but i also wouldnt really miss it if it was gone i never really got that tune in next week feel and ive already kind of forgotten how the season ended a decent start but well see how disney unfolds this is the way
2,this one will be going back the color is really blah and the fabric wasnt a texture i was expectingit is kind of thick and ribbed and i suspect it would stretch out over the course of the day overall the cut and style is cute but i just felt like i was wearing a hospital gown with the combination of the fabric and the style this may have been cute in a more vibrant color and lighter weight fabric
2,everything ok but processor speed is low
2,i ordered this dress is in the yelloworange the colors are pretty the pink detail is nice and thats about it the slip underneath is a form fitting yellow cotton no big deal the dress itself runs very large and in an unflattering way if i was pregnant it was perfect the material feels cheap to me and this along with the roomy fit is why this dress will be returned
2,wow this sure is close fitting as in suction cups to your body yikes definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves to me it seems like the material will wear well i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it not sure it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even lbs it wont work i ordered the medium and am usually a small the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas
2,unfortunately this dress is shaped like a sack and has no shape to speak of i have sent it back for a refund too big too shapeless
2,if youre going into season with similar expectations as the previous seasons i would reconsider these thoughts not to say that this latest season didnt have quality as we still get a stellar new cast cinematography atmosphere and vibe which will be a bit familiar from when we visited the hotels from last seasons characters having more going on then meets the eye however the bigger pieces of drama do take a lot longer to ramp up so if youre expecting similar momentum in build up then the first few episodes may end up being a turn off one of my favourite aspects of the series is the who done it factor it makes it more thrilling trying to put pieces together to try and guess who might bite the dust at the end of the season and how though this season i felt this part of the show didnt really click the same
2,ordered online and when it came i was very excited to open it but the photo doesnt show how incredibly wide the cut is it is also quite cropped and looked very awkward on me the embroidery is lovely but the style doesnt work i had a small but the area in the shoulders was cut very tight and it would not have worked well if i wanted to raise or lower my arms above shoulder height might work better on someone with a more petite frame but i do caution how voluminous the cut
2,not happy
2,this dress is adorable in the photo however in reality it fits like a tent the top would be okay although i would need a smaller size if i were to keep it it flares out in the skirt to become an aline and its just not very flattering if i had read the reviews before ordering i would have sized down but i ordered before any reviews had been posted sadly i must return
2,just didnt care for
2,very disappointed when i received this the colors and ombre fabric are beautiful beading and embroidery make it a even more unique top however the shape ruins all of that first it is nearly a crop top second it is boxy and its attempt to be a swing top only makes it bulky third need to size down sizes had to return this
2,this cardi is cuter in the stock photos in person the colors are a bit more drab stock photos also dont show quite how much of a swing shape this has it is very soft though returned it
2,having read all or most of the reacher novels i was first surprised at the musclebound specimen they cast to play him first departure from the book also it is taking episodes to tell the story of one book thats stretching things out a bit i think they could do books in one season without jeopardizing the story integrity entertaining but not compelling
2,im almost there wanting to downgrade to or stars im giving it a chance after watching rd episodes ending in a hope that anything clever would develop from this series flashbacks of home planet bring somewhat unrealistic picture of forest children society that i just cannot digest the planet they live in looks like cheap movie set with used plastic parts from previous star wars movies so many meaningless characters just confuse me there is no feeling of story line drama characters oh and the trash can robots voice what the hell love story ugh i dont know i guess there was some sort of triangle there they just did not make me care at all i also wanted like may others that guy that reported him to die some gruesome death i understand that star wars are children safe by design but there are so many grownup fans that it would be beneficial to create some sort of antihero series or evil wins or insert some blood effects i feel like little kid playing with plastic soldiers in barbies castle is this the end of movie industry
2,i really loved the idea of this dress and thought it may be perfect for work with a pair of wedges but the first thing that set me off was the color and the material the color is more street sign yellow than a soft warm yellow the fabric is a thin sheet like fabric that makes the yellow look even cheaper i was anticipating a thicker shirtlike fabric when i tried it on i liked the idea but the material and the color made me feel like i was wearing costumeor a parachute i will defin
2,great cast but every cliche and stereotype i could imagine it felt like a white exploitation movie even the talented performances of alexandra daddario and connie britton could not save it i have read reviews that call this satire but satire is supposed to be witty and amusing and nothing about this dark dark series was either i know netflix will buy anything but this one is hard to figure
2,this series is very historical and it really takes us to the time it represents very good production the actors are amazing and they fit the characters very well if you see this youll become addicted to it believe me each episode leaves you wanting more and more and you cant stop watching it you wont be able to stop thinking about thomas shelby for real cillian murphy is just phenomenal you either will want to be like him or youll fall in love with him or both my favorite show ever
2,used it for my samsung galaxy tab tablet stopped working after about months without warnings my tablet now recognizes as blank or unformatted card my computers wont even recognize it at all i am still trying to recover some priceless photos of my kids since my last backup of the card
2,i wanted to love this jumpsuit it looks adorable in the product photo i am about lbs and thus was overwhelming on me i tried everything pulling up the tie at the waist to create a higher line wearing a variety of heel heightsi couldnt seem to make it work there was just so much fabric on me it felt like i was wearing pajamas and not in a cute wear your pajamas out way i love the idea and the photo appears to have an adorable line and cut on me this jumpsuit was just
2,beautiful floral print and while i like the concept of this dress it was a total failure for me where the knit meets the print hit me at the top of my bust truly a disastrous look for a bustier figure since the fabric just drapes down and made me look much larger than i actually am same with the arms if the white knit had carried down to the elbow it would have elongated the arms instead of cutting them off mid biceps to make them look like giant hams im and a classic size and this
2,its not a bad concept but i wished for more i wish this tunic was a different material as it was wrinkley and dropwaist design instead of at the waist too bad i wanted to love it but it will go back
2,the asus tuf laptop impresses with its robust build and commendable performance designed to withstand demanding tasks it offers a reliable gaming and multitasking experience while the display quality might not be toptier its overall value and durability make it a solid choice for budgetconscious gamers and users seeking a dependable laptop
2,i wanted to love these jeans but as a woman who is almost there was way too much stretch in them i am always a size and i couldnt wear these they were way too tight they went back the next day i will say it could be my body type im a runner so my legs are muscular if you have very thin legs these could be great and work for you i loved the color dark blue
2,i really liked this dress in pictures online i wanted to wear it to work on casual fridays everything about this dress was a disappointment especially at this price point the fit was weird tight in some places too loose in others im usually xs or s i ordered this one is s its made out of a fairly thick and warm material yet the neck area of the dress is more exposed than it appears in pictures especially in the back making it awkward to have this very warm dress with neck upper b
2,tried this on in store was illfitting and sheer
2,oh i wanted this dress to work i bought it in green red and the solid blue all ran really small i just fit in a when i would normally take a in retailer sizes and lbs as with many other reviewers i also noticed that the zipper was a huge flaw it took a long slow motion to get it zipped because it would get stuck on the fabric variations such a cute style was really bummed it didnt work i kept ordering it in other colors thinking i would hit the jackpot but they wer
2,this looks cute on the model but was way too big loose and sloppy for me i probably needed a petite size i ordered a regular xs but returned it it is an okay black top nothing great
2,i am normally between a size and so i ordered these pants in both sizes to make sure i would have a nice pair of black crops to wear to work the seemed pretty tight all around so i returned the and kept the even though there was a little bit of room in the waist of course the size after a few hours of wearing had completely stretched out was bagging in the crotch area sliding around on my waist and creasing badly behind the knees i doubt i will wear these pants more than the o
2,this runs way big im a size purchased the medium its just big with no shape
2,i love maeve but this shirts quality was poor and it was not worth the price i would not recommend buying this online you really need to try the blouse on in the store to make the decision as to if its worth purchasing or not and in my case this is being sent back
2,this is huge i thought it would be oversize but with a bit of shape there is no shape to this and is a lot of material i ordered an xs and typically wear an xs or s in blouses sometimes medium in sweaters it seamed like sizes too big the material is very soft and the collar is nice there is a ribbon tie at the waist the tie is wimpy and could be nicer when tied there is so much fabric the is gathers and looks like i have no waist
2,i really liked the casual style of this top but i was disappointed when i put it on its cut weird the shoulder cutouts are smaller than pictured and just dont seem to hang right they dont hit where theyre supposed to and the sleeves were also not as pictured more like which i didnt like the color is really nice and i liked the fabric but the fit was just off i tried xs and s both fit weird
2,i was so bummed when this came inthe colors and print are beautiful but the neck is super itchy because of an elasticruffle combo there is also a liner which is a nice touch but its significantly shorter than the top layer which drove me nuts definitely going back
2,the suit is lovely but it is very long in the torso and gaps at the leg i was told that it runs small and to size up to a i did but i do not think the smaller one would have done better the bust is fake and it turns out when untied worst of all it emphasizes the tummy all in all not a good look for me i am not heavy but i do need tummy support normally i wear an and in garnet hill a sorry but it went back i really wanted to like it
2,ive watched the reacher movie with tom cruise and i think it was a decent movie nothing exceptional but it had an interesting plot and good actors but oh the profanity the sacrilege having a tom cruise playing the part of a character how many hateful comments ive read about that they picked a actor to play a wolverine and nobody complained about it anyway somebody was listening because they created the series with this time a bodybuilder to better represent the main character and thats about it we get it jack reacher is tall a tough guy muscular and every woman wants him everywere he goes there are villains or a fight and our man just beat the crap out of the bad guys next episode to be fair if someone enjoys looking at a modern rambo showing off his biceps around without substance dialogue or story that will be fine tom cruise is not tall i think we all know that but height is not everything
2,i read the existing reviews before purchasing and a few mentioned that this sweater ran large this has been my experience with most tops i have purchased from retailer i figured by ordering a medium i would receive a slightly loose to moderately loose fitting sweater this was not the case the sweater is short does not look anything like it does when you view the model from behind and i assume the model is taller than ias models are usually tall for reference i am medium build
2,review after month of useif you ok with low battery backup and low sound quality then u can go with it
2,very tasty but the bottom tortilla was very hard i let it sit for minutes before we cut it and it still oozed all over the place did not turn out wellmaybe my salsa was too watery im not sure but we couldnt even save it for leftovers it was too runny
2,i usually wear a size medium in angel of the north but this was very small i would need to have ordered a size large or xl to have it fit pretty but returning
2,length too long and waist to high these are not sized for petites
2,everything ok but battery backup is just to hr after charge not satisfied with battery
2,this recipe is to simplistic and not detailed enough by not letting the yeast sit i believe it caused the bread not to rise high enough this resulted in loafs that were shorter than they shouldve been i also reccomend a egg wash before cooking the texture of the bread was sorta like cornbread and a little mushy but not to bad really not great or terrible it was very crumbly and hard to cut thin slices
2,i wanted so badly to love this dress but i couldnt get past the thin material that you can actually see through not for this price anyhow the dress is shorter than i had anticipated and more fitted around the waistline flaring out at the bottom which i feel isnt accurately portrayed in the photo on the positive though the color is beautiful and the neck line stunning but alas will be returning
2,so great well written produced and acted such an entertaining and intelligent show cant wait for season the relationship between the characters is so well done and they really grow as the story progresses it was funny at times but very serious as well we laughed and cried we thought we had the ending figured out but we were surprised burton is so creative and gena ortega is fantastic the use of thing was really creative and he was a main character great attention to details on the costumes and set the music was good too the storyline was creative and you never really knew what characters were good or bad
2,i wasnt sure how the story will develop in the first episode still i dont nothing makes sense of there is nothing connected every episode is like waiting for something to happen and nothing just more awkward and random situations and why the rich mom let her daughter to be so rude the her brother with no consequences
2,this blouse is beautiful and i saw someone wearing it and she looked great i went and bought this to wear for a holiday party and it is not for people with any sort of chest it looked ridiculous on me as the pleats started right at the bra line and caused the blouse to tent out in both directions however looks super cute on those more on the flatchested side
2,i thought these bars were very heavy i dont think i will make again
2,heavy heating problem use as normal chrome or anything as normal use battery is bad performance quickly down on normal use work only hr backup and speaker quality is too bad camera quality is not good charger is so big so problem with carrying in travel experience
2,would be a nice sleeping toy if the engine of the belly breathing wasnt constantly defective i now sent the second one back with defectiveotherwise music and light very nice but for the price i expect a baby toy to last longer than months therefore i cant recommend it
2,the product is perfect but is not because of the screen bleeding issue i really didnt expect this you should provide us proper unit today laptop hinge automatically broke and still i dont know the reason probably a manufacturing defect in my unit it was fine before yesterday night and when i closed the lid it automatically broke poor build
2,this romper is cute wellmade and true to size but i havent figured it out how to put this on without having someone tie the back ties which pretty much means that going to the bathroom is not an option while you have this romper on not sure what the designers were thinking here im returning this one
2,like previous reviewers have said these run a bit small and im surprised no ones mentioned that these are very high rise for reference im lbs and am an retailer size in tops and pants i really wanted to love these pants but even after ordering a size up and trying on a i was still not in love and the other reviewers are right the back zipper is kinda hard to zip up the top of these pants are exactly the same as the essential flares so if youre thinking of ge
2,threw most of it down the garbage disposalnot tasty at allnot cheesey enough
2,while i love the design and shape of this blouse the fabric was of very poor quality i will return it
2,oh boyi didnt get this one and it runs small too bad
2,i generally dont spend this much on jeans but wanted a nice black pair so rolled the dice during the sale who can wear these im an average size and struggled to get these size s over my hips buttoned and zipped i looked like a stuffed black sausage best for thin frames and even then size up
2,lap top heavy heat with in mints and low battery backup
2,i was expecting a lot more but this was disappointing the material is thin and the quality isnt great it also hung loose just too loose as it runs very very large i returned it
2,while you cant count on the photo on your monitor to portray the exact color of an item these photos are way off instead of the warm charcoal i see online the pants are more of a dusty blue the material has very little stretch and i couldnt get into the size s the s were tight in the entire leg but huge in the waist for reference i usually wear a size in brands like for all mankind and citizens of humanity
2,on me thsi was ginormous looked like a mu mu it is pretty but there was just too much fabric even in the smallest size the quality seems nice and it looks pretty but overwhelming i will say i think it would work on tail lean people i have pretty muscular shoulders so the off shoulder look with that much fabric made me look pounds heavier no joke fabric is soft though give it a try just not for me ref lbs dd in waist
2,i can not imagine the cut in the waist being flattering on anyone i ordered an xs and an xxs still would have flared too much in the waste i ignored the previous review and that was a huge mistake
2,so sorry i have to disagree with a lot of stellar reviews here the taste of velveeta is so overwhelming i will however try again with cheddar
2,it is fully disappointed with its displayiam a graphic designer its completely showing different colour of some original coloursif you wanted to buy this laptop for graphic designing or dont go for itbut any other task its is good
2,excellent layers of flavor i didnt make this in a crock pot because there wasnt time i sauted all of the vegies in olive oil first added the spices except i used paprika instead of cayenne because my husband has acid issues i added tbl of cumin and tbl crushed bay leaves browned chicken and sausages added to mix brought to bowl in dutch oven and simmered for minutes then added the shrimp and simmered more minutes flavors were layered and distinct will add this to my chefs list and serve with confidence to my clients
2,i love my very old pilcro stet jeans they are the perfect denim weight and the back pockets are set in a way that is very flattering for the tush not so with the newer pilcros unfortunately the denim is thinner and may have more stretch and they get worn and pill on my inner thighs and the back pockets are set far apart making my back side look unnaturally wide its a bummer
2,its not too hard to imagine why hollywood and its series and awards no longer have any kind of relevance to the general public and this series is proof of that theres no real plot here full of boring dialogues nonsensical scenes some good acting and an annoying direction of photography hbo lately seems more like a cw of life than a channel that was once so iconic
2,this is the first hd in paris top i havent loved high hopes for this top since i love the brand and the color this was an online only item so i guessed at the size typically order a petite ordered the regular since the length was already quite short in the regular length it was oddly constructed small in the arms but boxy and oddly bell shaped bottom the lining was tough to keep straightened while trying to put it on too bad but it went back
2,i like this show and i am not dumb enough to believe it cannot happen or blind and selfdeluded enough to make myself believe some of it isnt happening in the world today i dont blabbity blah to convince myself that there arent people in the world today that would relish a world such as the one depicted i understand how and why everything in the show happens that as explained from the very beginning and then again in the latest episode the ceremony is a mix of making the wives amenable to concubines and because it is based on scripture that there are people outside of gilead fighting for the handmaidens and those that oppose what is happening the resistance amongst others and that not all governments are in on what gilead is doing lastly having been a bornagain christian a pentecostal at that i understand firsthand that you sometimes find the most hypocritical and odious people in churches and that some that most espouse god and gods love out of their mouths hold the most hate toward their fellow humans and animals in their hearts all that said i will go back to the beginning and reiterate that i do like the show im just loving it a little less than i did at the beginning it has begun to swerve away from the territory and point i thought it was trying to make into lalaland fiction that being of the commander acting the way he does with offred i will not specify what precisely in order that i do not have to use a spoiler tag but that coupled with nicks involvement is devolving the show into a drugstore romance novel and i am liking it less and less nothing against ms moss personally but i just dont see it and it rings untrue i understand too that filler is necessary and that they want to remain true to the book but i hope that the main issues remain at the forefront and that it doesnt become just another show
2,i had my eye on this one for awhile and decided to buy it when it popped back on my wishlist i can see why someone returned it the sweater top hits at the worst possible spot and made me look ridiculous like a mushroom top from the side i saw the potential but not enough to save it probably one of the worst things i have ever purchased from retailer
2,you find a television series once in a blue moon which blows your mind and peaky blinders has accomplished that in my mind as of this writing im on se which i think is the most wellwritten and explosive episodes of the series its also one of the most amazing series that i have seen these seem more like minifeatures with almost a full hour of drama by the time i started season three i started saying aloud how i love peaky blinders and its characters they thrive on a combination of excellent storytelling and photography breaking bad is the only other series that i know which have become the platinum standard of any series that i know exist i venture to believe that blinders beats out game of thrones as well the main reason why thrones and bad dont live up to what ive experienced with blinders the sheer boldness of how the show compels you to understand and even empathize with people who make a living out of doing just about everything illegal that they could ever muster in a place where just about everyone seems to be about some kind of illegal activity the complexities of the characters demand that everyone must sell who they are and i cannot for the life of me find any character who is a weak link to the series game of thrones is a terrific series as was breaking bad yet got has a number of slow moments breaking bad while rather straightforward regarding the plot was just somewhat unbelievable when viewed through the lens of reallife probability blinders is deeper and more raw without looking to any sense of patronizing emotions to give a sense of redemption blinders takes off the blinders by asking which holds more value between family friends relationships and business transactions or whether money is really what can repay the emotional anguish of those casualties called relationships blinders has been throwing some really interesting plot twists and ive finally been blown away at where this series is heading i remember the first season where a young winston churchill was introduced and i feel that was probably the slowest part of the series even got suffered from the need to explain whowhat was happening while breaking bad simply jumped right into a whirlwind of trouble thrown the way of mr white stick with this however these characters have truly embraced their roles and the photography and writing seem to actually have gotten even better im not one to ever have been interested in an emotional investment of series characters but this so far has been my finest emotional investment the violence sometimes is quite intense so much so that my wife stopped watching by the second season considering the date in which blinders is told i expect that the violence might be rather extreme perhaps im being unfair in even speaking about got and breaking bad two other exemplary shows which made me loyal to their broadcasts but blinders keeps raising the production bar like the other two havent quite done
2,im a diabetic and wanted to find out the carbohydrate content i could not find any nutritional information whatsoever badly managed walls
2,good storyline well cast heart warming and funny not realistic all the time but a good diversion nonetheless keeps your attention makes you believe there are really good guys in the world
2,this is the only tv show i have seen all of that i genuinely consider to be absolutely perfect from start to finish our flag means death is close and i prefer that show but season was slightly imperfect that may prove true here ill do another review when season releases but right now i would say almost every minute of andor is perfect and if it isnt its not enough to care its one thing to have a hour movie be perfect two hours you can fit in no flaws i dont want to diminish the movies i consider perfect i just want that to enhance how truly amazing this show is that in all of its current runtime i never once felt like something was overly unnecessary or bad to make a perfect season of television is a monumental task in my eyes and the people who made andor did it i cant sing this shows praises enough every bit of it from the directing to acting to writing to story to score is all so absolutely perfect i cant recommend it enough its just perfect
2,i have watched a lot of netflix series and movies and wednesday is an absolute delight ive watched this series times now and still laugh out loud at the antics of wednesday played brilliantly by jenna ortega all the characters are well played and there is not a person out of place in this production it was great to see gwendoline christie playing a completely different character than briene of tart in the wonderful game of thrones she as all of her fellow actors absolutely nailed it im hoping that there will be another series of this fantastic show well done netflix an absolute triumph
2,i fell in love with this shirt the moment i saw it unfortunately when i went to put it on there was a hole running down the seam in the back i went to store to exchange wore the shirt and someone tells me i have two holes in the back of my shirt horrified i went home took a look both holes along the seam i will be returning this i really liked this shirt
2,i have wanted this dress since i first tried it on in april finally got it as a birthday gift and after looking at it closely there was makeup on the collar i checked the instructions and it says cold water wash so i washed only the collar part by hand and every part that got water on it bled looks like the popsicles are melting im so sad because this dress is adorable im buying another in hopes retailer will make this right by taking back the first one should be dry clean only
2,i love deletta and regularly search for their items here on retailer however this one is a miss as i think it runs small or you need to be taller and thinner then i for the gathering opening to hit you right i did really like the color ordered the brown and material but back it goes
2,not a fan of this cake was quite dense and tasted like dark chocolate with all brown sugar and cocoa the frosting was excellent
2,the quality and fabric of this dress are lovely but unfortunately i found it to be very unflattering and shapeless it fit me like a sack i ordered the m and i suppose i shouldve sized down but even in the s im afraid this would be far too large for reference i am and lbs i have a curvy build so this shape dress just wasnt right on me i imagine it will look cute on more of a boyish figure returned
2,very poor speaker
2,i didnt really understand the other reviews until i received mine in the mail i love cloth stone and this is just not up to their normal quality i bought the blue and yellow colors of this blouse its very soft but the blue already had strings coming from under the arms and i hadnt even tried them on yet material is super soft but thin cut is weird under the arms and tight sleeves are also tight i am usually an xs or s in cloth stone so i ordered smalls i just fit the arms but t
2,pretty shirt on the hanger but theres a goof in the design when i tried it on my d self there became this weird ruffle right besidebelow the bust that you can barely see in the right of the photo now that i know its there the tulip nature of the shirt is pretty in concept but where the top layer starts makes the fabric stick out right by your bust and its not flattering and im just a b
2,dear retailer designers just want a nice dress that isnt made from polyester dont mind paying bigger bucks for quality fabrics but please enough of the polyester love your customers
2,loved the idea of this unfortunately it disappointed all around its way too short and ran small the fuzzy collar was also different than pictured in the stock photo and looked a bit tacky and cheap the pricepoint is also way off the mark for this piece usually an retailer small lbs dd but ordered a medium small would not have fit in this piece do not recommend
2,i agree with the other two reviews that this shirt runs large or something i ordered an xs my usual size xss the body of the shirt is very loose the upper arms are a bit snug and i dont have large arms the shoulder seams are in a very strange place but when you look at the model it doesnt look so bad with the shirt i received and another reviewer the seam was puffy making for a strange look in theory the shirt should have worked but didnt i loved the pattern not the fit
2,pretty design but when i tried it on the fabric was thin and delicate i dont think it would last long with much wear too bad if the fabric were sturdier itd be great as the cut is flattering and i love the pockets
2,loved the premiere im very excited for the rest of the season it did the game justice in the first episode i think and the first part of the premiere was just as anxiety inducing and riveting as the game i think the actor who plays ellie is good but im excited to see more of her because so far im not sure if im set on her as ellie yet the show is great how its filmed and how it does have a lot of intense action scenes that make you feel like youre in the show just like how the video game makes you feel part of the game i am curious of how many seasons this will end up lasting if they move through the first game in the first season completely i feel like we might just be looking at two seasons
2,after reading the reviews i placed an order because it was the only top that caught my eye on the entire price downs lately all my usual l sizes from retailer turn out huge so i ordered a size smaller from what i usually wear all would have been ok if the top wasnt so darn short for reference im ft tall lb its weird that this top looks completely the opposite of the model on the photo from a loose looking fit with longer sleeves looking like a stylized sweatshirt that is not what
2,let me start off by saying that i really really wanted this jumpsuit to work as it looked good on me and was tts got a p unfortunately it didnt work out due to the two buttons at the top which break way too easily i had to return it and exchange for another jumpsuit but it did me no good as the second one did the very same thing so i didnt even bother trying it on the buttons broke through before i even got the chance as the material is far too thin and the back of the buttons just pop
2,love the shape and flow of this dress but i was sent a dirty stained dress so this is going back would not recommend
2,the shirt is very soft but it felt very large and unflattering the back felt bulky and looked awkward definitely returning
2,i loved this romper so much the material is thin but perfect for summer the style is just what i was looking for its so so cute and fit perfectlyat first i wore it one time and then washed it exactly as described on the tag and it shrunk beyond recognition it went from loose and flowy like on the model to little booty shorts and a body suitnot the look i was going for i am so disappointed
2,i pretty much am in agreement with the first original reviewer on here big disappointment especially if you have hips and are busty _____________ pros great breathable fabric cute look overall sash in front brings it all together buttons are hidden under a panel of fabric which is a nice touch ____________ cons runs very small in the bust normally i can wear a or with most of retailers stuff i tried on a and it fit everywhere with entirely too much room i
2,performance is ok but that copilot is not working very disappointed they are taking too much money but copilot not working dont by this product otherwise money will be waste
2,the title says it all while the quality was good when i put this dress on a felt like i was wearing a shapeless sack fashioned out of wallpaper the length was longer than on the model makes sense since i am only which was ok but the overall fit was just too big i am a size and tried the xs which was huge just not flattering or breezy or sexy in any way going back
2,i wanted to love this dress as the length cut and color are exactly what ive been looking for but i was terribly disappointed in how thin and see through the material is
2,the top is more of a cream color than an ivory its also a bit boxer than anticipated fit is true to size
2,these pants are more like not i was very dissappointed the color is great and so is the fabric if you look more closely at the model the pants dont fit her either they are too small i havent decided whether or not to take them back because i am losing weight i am a so far but these pants are like a i need the color because they go perfectly with a top i bought from retailer
2,this dress runs very large i am and lbs hourglass curvy build i ordered a size small and its enormous on me the description says fitted but it is not fitted at all its like a big wool sack id have to gain lbs for this dress to come close to fitting im very sad that the fit is so far off and the dress is now all sold out in all smaller sizes including petite i never normally buy petite clothes but i think i would have to get a petite xs if it were available the dress lo
2,i recommend this dress because it is beautiful stylish and well made even though it did not work for me i tried the small and extra small the first way too big lengthwise hit my knees as well as in the shoulders the latter to tight across the chest not for me but worth a try i am typically a small with usually never have a problem with length
2,i so wanted to love this sweatshirt it is very soft and seems like excellent quality and material the pattern is pretty and i envisioned spending hours cuddled up reading in it unfortunately the body of the sweatshirt particularly the front torso area was too big and it popped out around me like a balloon the arms fit well so i dont think that i could have gone down a size i was also not keen on the way the neck hung which was either very stiff and tall around my neck when unfolded
2,im petite and i knew buying this that it would be a big sweater that is the look that is portrayed on the model the sweater is scratchy the neck was so big and bulky i had trouble making it lay right it looks great on the model here but not on me going back so bummed the color gray is true to what is shown and it has little holes or openings across the shoulders so there is a tiny bit of detail overall not a great sweater
2,taste horrible and so hard
2,this shirt is adorable butit didnt work for me im a smaller gal with a large chest g i tried on the small since it seemed so flowy and large the sleeves were tight yet the back of the shirt flowed way too much making the shirt look huge on me perhaps a more fitted back and i would have been in love love the blue color
2,this first episode did the last of us ip justice it felt really fleshed out i was super excited and scared at the same time for this show to release since im a big fan of the games usually the movies andor shows are a big let down after not this one if it continues to go on as strong as it opened this is gonna be a masterpiece that will most likely make me watch it more than once i love how the writers took their time with the first episode to really let us know the characters even though there have been a lot of zombie shows this is the one you need to watch amazing start and cant wait to see where this is going
2,purchased this in white specifically because i loved the back detail i dont know why most designers overlook the back huge disappointment the back is totally plain not at all like the picture of the white top on here and the fabric in the back isnt even the same material as the front its almost as if the back is made out of leftover lining from another garment it was a very sad return i usually love this brand this was just a quality control oversight i guess
2,i thought the sweater itself was beautiful but found the fabric to be stiff and itchy
2,the colors are vivid and perfectly autumnal but the fit is a mess it was overall too large the waistline curves up in the front and then falls into small pleats which was maternityish the waistband was thicker than the dress and sat away from my body and the material was a cheapish poly had the outer dress been made from the same material as the lining i would have liked it better the modesty closure was a plus but the dress was already unraveling when i took it out returned
2,very very bad this producti have recommended to any coustmer not buy this productacer product is very bad productbattery problem shutdown problemthis laptop is automatically offso please not buy this product
2,i was very excited to buy this card gb for my samsung galaxy note the product arrived promptly and i was able to format it to ex fat and use it right away in my smart phone however exactly days later when i removed the card after turning off the phone and inserted it in my desktop i got an error saying that the card was corrupted and unreadable and that i needed to format itsince i had already got a lot of data on it including a lot of videos and images of our newborn twins formatting was not a viable optioni tried to get the card working on my pc desktop mac air laptop and the samsung galaxy note but to no avail finally i decided to format it there too i kept getting errors and that the computer was unable to format the card finally i tried full format via my pc got an error again and then right away quick format and that worked so the card is back and working in my note again but now i wont trust it anymore not after having lost so many irreplaceable images and videosi am a professional photographer and use memory cards all the time this has been the worst of the lot
2,id like to start by disclosing that im a major longtime witcher fan so this is going to be a long rant i was pretty excited when in word got out that netflix will be making a show based on the books this excitement fizzled out when i saw the first trailer i briefly got my hopes back up after the first couple of episodes of the actual series but as it went on i was cringing ever harder as i watched characters and stories i know and love being twisted almost beyond recognition but playing around with the source material was to be expected and does not of itself make a series or a movie a bad one if done right a film can stand on its own the lord of the rings trilogy and cloud atlas come to mind these films did not follow the respective books word for word but stayed true to the spirit that makes them great so is the witcher a quality show when viewed independently of the source material well this first seasons defining trait is its desire to be liked the showrunners seem to be trying to emulate the success of the obvious comparison the title which opened the door for highbudget series game of thrones when it came out gots grandscale grim fantasy narrative was something new and bold despite this or perhaps because of this the first three seasons took the time to develop characters and set up conflicts mostly sticking to the books however it could be argued that got became really popular after season four once it started deviating from the source material in favour of entertaining its audience and making progressively less sense in the process its almost like the witcher series creators having reached the same conclusion decided to skip story and character building and to instead come out swinging straight to the big stuff or perhaps it is due to the nature of netflix as a streaming service youve got to hook the viewer as quickly as possible or theyd just switch to the next series available at their fingertips the showrunners desire to show us everything right away is evident in the first episode it opens with a big wellanimated monster weve got the cgi and continues with a massive though unremarkable battle scene weve got the money to show you stuff got only featured its first battle in season four if im not mistaken a nicely choreographed sword fight weve got the action some tragic deaths weve got the drama and a warning about the fate of the world weve got the epic narrative showing off with visuals is ok but the attempt to introduce the overarching epic conflict from the getgo creates script and pacing problems for pretty much the entire season it is hard to understand what is going on when there is no exposition whatsoever who are these people battling or to care for dramatically filmed deaths when the characters have been on screen for only a couple of minutes as the show continues the script embarks on explaining what the hell is going on while also trying to stay true to the episodic nature of the short stories however since geralts separate adventures actually happen before the main narrative starts and we are shown this narrative already underway in e we are treated to some badly done and confusing time jumps cirilla is told to run and find geralt but he doesnt seem to know she even exists oh wait hes actually doing some other unrelated stuff years before she was born time jumps can be an excellent plot or exposition device breaking bad utilises them to great effect and they are also found in the witcher novels but not here simply putting some dates once at the start of sequences would have helped though it would have been but a prop for the bad writing moreover the rushed script makes the entire relationship between cirilla and geralt ring hollow it is portrayed as the driving force behind the plot yet there is in fact no relationship at all the show has them share practically no screen time there is no explanation why geralt cares so much about her nor of her motivation to look for someone shes never seen other than her grandmother telling her so how would ciri know even if she found him anyway this is mostly the result of skipping a very important story from the second book about how the witcher and the girl meet a number of other things dont make sense either one example would be the inconsistent way sorcery works we are told doing magic has a cost in life force not how it is in the books illustrated by a flower dying when a stone is levitated however this rule seems to apply only for some people and only when itd look cool in one scene a mage is forced to commit suicide in order to create a fireball later the same episode another mage incinerates half a battlefield without any apparent cost this brings me to another point the way the nilfgaardian empire is portrayed in the books and games the nilfgaard vs the north clash is just a political conflict serving as backdrop for the fates of geralt and cirilla there is no good or bad both sides are painted in gray with ordinary people suffering in the middle i guess the producers figured this is too complex for the average viewer so they cast nilfgaard as evil religious fanatics sacrificing humans featuring an archbaddie and they are opposed by the north protecting their way of life on to the more technical side of things the acting is mostly ok people seem to swear by cavills performance but he is not how i imagined geralt objectively though i suppose he does a fine enough job he brings physicality to the role and seems to be passionate about it offscreen i dislike what the showrunners have done to the character of yennefer but anya chalotra plays the part shes been given with intensity freya allan is forgettable as cirilla and so is anna shaffer as triss a minor character in the books and the show but a major one in the games so a lot of people have been disappointed by the performance in a strange move the show has cast overly young actresses for some sorceresses anya chalotra is but is given the task of conveying the air of confidence and authority of a woman that is years old doesnt quite make it while years old freya allan is picked to portray a girl that is just entering her teens the only actor who i can definitely say nailed his role is joey batey as the funny sidekick jaskier the music is also mostly alright toss a coin to your witcher seems to have conquered the charts though i think it doesnt fit the settings atmosphere not that the show gets that either i prefer the last rose of cintra and the call of the white wolf but to each his own i am not sure how the show manages to occasionally give off bmovie vibes with a budget of mln but it does i blame it on the bad directing and the poor artistic design i dont have such a big problem with the nilfgaardian armor as everybody seems to have but was for example disappointed by the dryads looking like extras from xena warrior princess to wrap it up the witcher is a show that has its high points but is dragged down to being mediocre by its anxiety to please it is inspired by and not based on the books like the credits would have you believe it is more the hobbit than the lord of the rings in more ways than one and whatever its redeeming qualities i personally cant forgive netflix for ruining the adaptation of my favourite fantasy story but the show has actually gone on to become fairly popular a second season has been confirmed thus netflix has fulfilled what seems to have been their objective retain subscribers in the face of stiffening competition people who liked the latter seasons of got and are now looking for another fantasy fix will likely enjoy this series too but considering the source material the show could have been so much more had it had the guts to not just take the shortcut to season perhaps the next installment will deliver on this potential though i personally dont have my hopes up
2,first of all this is not pullover styling there is a side zipper i wouldnt have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me second of all the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath not at all what is looks like or is described as sadly will be returning but im sure i will find something to exchange it for
2,im very disappointed in the quality it seems more like a pajama than a tunic definitely not worth dollars i plan to return it
2,i loved this dress and it fit perfectly i did not have any issue with the camisole being tight and i am really curvy i did however have a problem trying to take it off it has no zipper and in order for me to get it over my head i had to stretch my shoulders to the point where i ripped the back i went to the store and tried on the larger size and ripped that one too i tried to take it off more delicately but i couldnt maybe it was me but this dress is too much hassle if i went any highe
2,ordered this dress in an xs that is the size i usually wear this runs small but not only that it is the way it is cut very small through the hips thighs and legs hard to walk in it the material felt kind of cheap to me i thought it looked really good on the model but got it home and didnt like it at all it went back
2,this one pulled across my shoulders and neck in a creepy way did not like the way that it fit returned
2,i know for one i am late to a lot of shows because i listen to bad reviews and dont watch something only to find out later the showmovie was great all along they are right however in that hc carries the show but who cares leo has carried anything hes ever been in along with most lead men over all this is a good adaptation and a great tv show that will leave you wanting more which luckily is coming soon so watch it now
2,i ordered this shirt online and didnt even try it on it is super see through and i would need to wear a tank underneath and i dont want to have that extra layer in the summer it is cute though
2,i have always used sandisk products but this was a disappointment it totally failed in my galaxy s after about months i will order another brand but no more sandisk for me
2,i wanted this sweater to work but sadly it failed first the pink was way to sheer for my liking the sheerness caused a weird color overlap on the stomach area then the band at the bottom was too tight causing a weird ballooning affect a shirt underneath could work but it takes away from the beauty of the knit the soft pink is gorgeous but not good for medium to light skinned folks
2,with the high amount of sugar required the bread would be like store bought bananas are quite sweet on their own i used c brown sugar and the bread was amazing
2,ram is not upgrade in laptop backlit fingerprint not in laptop usb port is very tite touchpad and keyboard not working in proper way heating there are problem with me my suggestion you can purchase any other laptop
2,i though this dress would be similar to the turtleneck swing dress by maeve its not first of all it runs very large i purchased a small i am usually a xs or small in maeve i purchased a small in the turtleneck swing dress the shoulders were very wide you had to manually cross the fabric around your neck but it didnt lay as flat as what i wanted around my chest and it was quite large around my rib cage and stomach making it rather shapeless i really wanted this dress to work i love
2,this looks cute in the web photo unfortunately it is absolutely huge in person i got the small and have to return it because it is not wearable for me
2,bluetooth disconnecting within every minutesand connecting automatically
2,love tiny i am lbs depending on the day and a a i also have a very long torso and tiny shirts are one of the few brands that are usually long enough for me this one however was a huge miss i ordered online in my usual tiny xs it was much too big around and felt shorter in the front than stated so it looked boxy on me however the worst part was the placket the description doesnt note that its held together with a tiny snap that snap takes nothing to undo and then
2,light weight and good for basic performance note i thought there was a touchpad loose issue as it was creating noise on touch but later on found it has button below touchpad so it has left click and right click button edit after using for year found it has keyboard issue when i press f it accidentally pressing win p key i tried the service centre they do replaced the keyboard but it still gives the issue
2,this top is really beautiful but looks absolutely horrible on my apple shaped body in the words of my husband i looked like a star trek villain
2,i found this as a return in the store i tried the xxs i was so excited because it looked really cute on the hanger it was so huge looked like i was wearing an xl
2,purchased because it was on offer and my blindingly white legs needed a bit of help i only wanted a gradual tanner because there is less chance of obvious streaks it smelt nice on application a light floral scent however within a few hours it smelt stronger than actual full on fake tan very unpleasant i could also feel the cream sitting on my skin not fully absorbed or dry the actual tanning result was barely noticeable i wont be buying again
2,i loved this color and ordered it online because i thought it would work for both casual and work days dressed up a little ummmmm no its weird and boxy and does not look at all like it does on the model i think maybe if you have no bust whatsoever and size way down it would look okay im only a b weigh pounds and it made me look huge and awkward this is going back
2,i love tracy reese dresses but this one is not for the very petite i am just under feet tall and usually wear a p in this brand this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame not a stranger to alterations shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me i returned this dress
2,i thought this was a really fun and interesting take on wednesday addams it has much the same feel as teen dramas like riverdale and sabrina which i enjoyed but without the sex cursing and never ending meanness that pervades those the acting is great and the writing is high quality there are a bunch of twists so although you may guess the ending you can still enjoy the ride my husband complained that she was not as biting as in the addams family movies but i think thats a good thing it would be hard to maintain that level for eight episodes centered entirely on her you follow wednesday as she tries to solve a series of murders at her parents alma matter which is now her boarding school as well tim burton maintained the humorous tone the addams family is known for it has a lot of funny or lighthearted moments without being slapstick
2,wasnt crazy about this top it looked great online but in person its just a boring and lifeless top
2,not good
2,while im watch the first season i just waiting to be impressed specily when some my idiot friends recommended it to me but unfortunately days of my life waste foe nothing on that
2,i was really excited after finding this top online and reading the reviews the combination of peplum cap sleeves and color seemed too good to be true i ordered a size medium but unfortunately this top is on the short side so wearing it with pants or jeans did not work out in addition the fabric was more sheer than it looks in the picture and the vneck in front dipped a little lower too a camisole might have solved both of those problems but i didnt bother i returned it to the store
2,i loved this dress when i saw it however the fit was way off i am lbs and the small was way too big from the waist down when the xs arrived i was sure it would be perfect unfortunately the waist hit way too high above my rib cage and the dress was too short it was as if it was a petite size i was very disappointed as this is such a pretty easy dress to just throw on for school unfortunately neither size looked right on me and i had to return both the material is also not the s
2,im a short girl but i usually wear tops in a small or medium at retailer for me i would have needed this shirt in a size at least one notch smaller than even offered this shirt is adorable love the details i wanted it so bad which is why i paid so much for a basic tshirt still it was large to the point of frumpiness and could have used some sort of scoop or vneck to break up the dots
2,if youve read the books you know reacher is indeed supposed to be this literally taller than life guy who can easily handle six enemies all while calmly analyzing a new clue in a murder case but if feels like the show doesnt give the main character any room to develop depth or edge its just another golden filtered tv show that you watch while doing something else
2,is not a place i want to be even if the style of a sweater is great yes this sweater is very cropped but i think itamps definitely intended to be worn off the shoulder to drop the waist a bit itamps the itchiness that makes it an immediate ampquotnoampquot and thatamps coming from someone who has serious fiber itch tolerance
2,star visually very interesting star thing as narrative its a train wreck in three parts character no character student or otherwise seems to have any genuine motivation or development other than tired tv teenage angst versus hormones there are no shades of gray here only giant strokes of good or evil eg normies versus outcasts the one exception id say would be thing admirable projection of emotion and agency story a good mystery should have enough clues presented slyly enough for a clever viewer to engage and ask questions none of that is here its just baffle em with bs and hope no one asks too many uncomfortable questions truly some head shaking moments in the last few episodes credibility build a world play by its rules is wednesday a minisociopath or just a misunderstood girl is this a world in which murder is a thing to be admired or reviled is wednesday really an antihero i endured this with my gf who enjoyed it wednesday doesnt know what it wants to be final thought gomez hate please reference the original addams family no not that one the original comics created by charles addams nailed the representation
2,wednesday is a mystery fantasy comedy crime adventure boxset featuring season episodes it will return for a second series my mum had watched this and said how good it was so had to watch it as i use to like the adams family surprisingly it was really good so much better than the original movie jenna ortega who plays wednesday is sensational what a talented young lady she is far better than the original actress who played her in fact all the cast are good in playing their characters i was hooked from beginning to end so good cant wait for the second series wednesday is a brilliant boxset to watch and you wont be disappointed if you like harry potter fantastic beasts then you will love this its a hell of a fantasy so sit back and get watching wednesday its certainly one to watch streaming on netflix right now
2,i splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it even though the design is adorable the fabric contains acrylic and the knitted fairisle part started pilling within the first week of wear after a month and a couple washes it looks horrible and the fleece part is looking a little grungy as well so so disappointed the top is intentionally oversized and comes down to my crotch i could have easily sized down
2,my daughters and i all wear a size small and are heights range between and this dress was sloppy on every one of us i dont think a size x small would have made a difference the length is all over the place im not sure how or where you would fit a bra into the picture on the positive side was very soft it may work as a beach cover up
2,as soon as you get up close to this sweater you will notice that the bird on the front is of an interesting kind of materialalmost like carpet that has been shaved waaaaaaaay down so that the little fibers are sticking straight up and a fraction of a millimeter high i was not excited about this texture and can imagine it will be a huge magnet for collecting lint and dust throughout the day the fit was way off on this one for me and was not flattering at all it wasnt for me at all even thou
2,the print and fabric are great but this dress has odd construction or maybe i have an odd construction anyway im weigh d i ordered the small and it fit perfect up top and in the arms but the issue was in the hips im somewhere between athletic and curvy the skirt looks more aline in the photo but its actually cut pretty straight spanx would have helped but im not about to wear spanx all day in a workcasual dress i think a medium would make the top too big so i
2,so bummed i was really hoping this top would work for me i got the black in regular size and the pink in petite size both hit my breast too high and were too bulky in the mid section i have a sort of short torso wear a small c and am have a defined waist when tops are bulky it gives me no shape and just looks terrible i am having the hardest time finding pretty tops that suit my figure they did not lie flat like on the model but had so much extra fabric they stuck out the constr
2,if a laptop is left shut down or unused for one week the battery will drain completely to
2,i knew that the cut of this shirt was boxy but this is huge i wear a l or xl at retailer and i got the ml and was swimming in this top sadly this will be going back
2,this looks so cutebut dont be fooled it is so poofy it does not look in real life like it does on the model it poofs way out on the sides and looks ridiculous i was so disappointed
2,the fabric and cut of this blouse are beautiful but the v was so deep i could never wear it without a cami and i think that would ruin the look i have a large chest but the similarly cut blouse without the textured fabric from the same designer fit me fine this one is just cut differently i even tried sizing up and down to no avail the photo on the model seems misleading because i dont see how the neck would lay flat or stay that high on anyone even with a smaller chest i was so
2,after days very normal usage battery drain very fast within seconds to mins battery backup used product receivedoff screen cover removed too much heat with in minutes use waste of money
2,i try to find something to like about everything i buy even if it turns out to be a disappointment for me the neckline of this shirt is absolutely beautiful and super flattering it was one of the only things that made me want to keep the shirt but unfortunately it was not enough this shirt is super boxy and runs large i would recommend sizing down for those who want to try this if you have a larger chest it might be worth ordering your regular size so that the buttons wont pull at the ch
2,this looked nothing like the picture on me was long and very unflattering belled out greatly at the bottom also the material was thick which is why i give it three starts for quality but overall awkward
2,could not wait for this to come and so disappointed first of all its not a happy orange it a darker rust second it is huge fits in the shoulders and is super comfy and cute but would be a dynamite maternity top you could go to term in this blouse back it goes so sad
2,i made this with the flour tortillas and they were soggy slimy and did not taste good we ended up dishing out the filling which was good and not eating the tortillas at all if i were to make this again i would use tortilla chips instead
2,didnt like at all itchy fabric looked good on model but on on busty girl
2,the color of the sweater is beautiful but the fit was awful it was too swingy and made me look like i gained lbs instantly im lbs i will be unfortunately returning this item
2,this was not what i was expecting at all i am a medium in just about everything but ordered a large to possibly wear this as a dress instead of a tunic since i am around the large fit like a small on me and not like a typical oversized sweater type small but a normal fitted top small a previous reviewer said it is long and straight and i think that is a good description for it i think the models wearing this in the pictures are all wearing an extralarge or a different cut of the
2,the shirt is cute but there is no way that the length posted on the website is correctits a crop top this was returned
2,i am new to watching the yellowstone series i enjoy the show but the language is horrible it is not necessary to use gods name in vain i would like to see this change an i would be able to enjoy the show more
2,a beautiful sweater and very flattering on the stock photos do not do it justice but i had to give it only stars because it was so itchy that i couldnt even keep it on in the dressing room for more than a minute
2,very low performance and hanging the laptop
2,this cake was moist ill give it that but as far as taste goes the flavor was very lacking i tasted almost no chocolate and that was after i added more cocoa than it called for i would not make this again to me a chocolate cake should taste more chocolatey than this cake did
2,im taller so its not uncommon for things to be too short on me but this was really short for the style it was very wide and loose all over in my usual size both up top and in the wavy part below the style really just did not work with the length it looked very odd
2,the witcher based on a sapkowskis saga not at all id say if you read the books or even played the games dont bother watching netflixs witcherlike show cause itll be a huge disappointment the creators of this abomination arent capable of understanding the witty dark humor of sapkowskis novels theres no climate no soul nothing left of sarcastic and proud yennefer cynic and selfish womanizer yaskier or highly complex philosophical geralt of rivia the writers should have read the whole book series not only the short stories the show is dull its generic something i wont recommend watching ever
2,i wanted to love this shirt but was very disappointed i had read other reviews and still ordered but wish i would have listened the shirt looks nothing like photos online and is extremely boxy and unflattering had to send it back
2,not as cute as photos and too small in chest i am lbs and the small was too tight in the chest and i am not large here at all shoulders and sleeve length fit well will return not comfortable and will need to be able to button it on rainy days
2,while this device is decent for its price range i found it difficult to complete even simple daily tasks casual gaming and using system software felt sluggish making the whole system choppy within just one day of use i experienced frustration while trying to set up the pc for normal use which led me to submit a return request
2,i think its a very good tv show although i consider that the first seasons are excellent and the fourth lowered its quality a bit even so it has extremely good scenes i think its a very good tv show with very good performances by elisabeth moss yvonne strahovski and ann dowd
2,monotor not working in six months
2,the overall styling was great and the dress is supercute if a little thick its made of denim after all i ordered a size down from my normal and even then i was swimming in it the worst part and the aspect that will make me return it is that the arm holes hang down so low that id have to wear a tank top under the dress im returning it though it is really cute and i love this brand the arm holes killed it for me
2,this suit is absolutely gorgeous but it really will only fit a very short waisted gal it fit perfectly in the body and in the bust but just was not long enough for me to lift my arms up and my size c cup boobs to not pop out i was very sad to return it i am a size with c cup boobs and ordered it in a medium
2,its way more distressed than it looks in the picture and that was a no for me
2,the color says red but its more like a rust im so it was long and would need to be tailored and the fabric is so thin i was afraid it would rip if it got caught on anything finally returned it without it making it out the door
2,i love the look of this dress on model but sadly fit didnt work out very short waisted and tight across chest with very ample arm holes im c reliably a size this dress seemed at least sizes off for me my daughter usually a size could wear it except for the arm hole size and the fact that its dollars and shes going back btw novelty print means ice cream novelty little popsicles with bites taken out cute but more juvenile than i expected
2,i like the design of the dress but the fabric makes it look cheap for an expensive dress i had expected better quality
2,so these look so good online i love flare and the button detail however on me they were very long which i knew but too thighhugging for my taste and the buttons looked cheap i ordered the tan color thus back they went for reference i am and and ordered the
2,i made this but may have made a mistake doubling the recipe to accommodate my bounty of overripe bananas i thought my pans were the right size but one of the loaves ran over in the oven and even though i greased the already nonstick pans i couldnt get either loaf out of the pan intact having said that the flavor was good and i will try the recipe again and readjust my star level
2,although i love the soft feel of the sweater the zig zag design was very unflattering also the length is much shorter than appears in the picture i will be returning it
2,if there is one sin in this totally perfect series it is that it is precisely much too perfect almost overwhelms me to experience all at the same time fantastic turns of the plot location customs acting light photography camera use and audio and music kind of baroque experience music would be obvious for anyone seeing it please connect it to a good audio system and play it loud but i mean audio also the way it often transfers from the wide scale scenery to the intimate one in the same take just using audio is nothing short of spectacular another of the many remarkable things in pb some chapters specially at the opening are a simply a poem in the use of traveling cameras color punctuations the sparks or fire bursts for example red colors going all over the screen in a time sequence a mesmerizing visual pleasure i think this must be seen several times to really appreciate all the beauty thats inside it
2,ive been a fan of charles addams for most of my life his macabre humor fits me perfectly the nameless characters out of monster rally the first chas addams book i came into contact with made me cry with laughter making people look at me strangely same thing the the first tv series with carolyn jones as morticia and the recast with anjelica huston and raul julia i just couldnt hold the laughters while watching now comes this pathetic gothic emo nancy drew so badly directed that a very good kid actress was turned into a void figure that could not extract a single laughter from anybody in my household not even from the teens and preteens among my grandchildren frankly accustomed to being dragged into fits of loud laughter by dark or macabre slapstick masterpieces like beetlejuice corpse bride and sleepy hollow i was expecting more much more guess tim burton was included for promotional reasons only but as is typical of netflix their choice of directors sck i give it three stars because of the solid acting by christina ricci luis guzman and catherine zeta jones if you are of legal drinking age avoid it its completely focused on highschoolers edit an extra star for the h chapter where unk fester made me laugh from start to finish almost true to the cartoon character by chas addams
2,i really wanted to love this blazerive even tried it on several times hoping it would look better the next time around spoiler it didnt overall it makes me look pretty frumpy and not put together i really love saturdaysunday brand and was hoping for a nice comfy blazer to wear to work will be returning instead
2,i wanted to love this so much that i ordered in both a mp and sp both have gone back im petite and curvy particularly on top i wear petites of the time this didnt fit like a petite it was cut like full size in every way particularly the arm holes and length when the mp didnt fit i always start trying on in the larger size i thought well surely the small will be better i considered keeping because i would wear it with jackets over it then decided that was crazy disappoin
2,product not a good
2,my vshape figure broad shoulder narrow hips waist not well defined looked completely square in this not flattering at all perhaps better for other figures
2,i really enjoyed this good action a jack reacher thats not ft tall whats not to like the only mystery not solved was the one of the disappearing t shirt every five minutes but hell if i looked like that i would never where anything
2,waste of moneyonly for online class
2,this dress makes me so sadthe textured stretchy fabric color length and overall swingy fit are spot on as another reviewer noted though the armholes and neck totally ruin the dress the neck is tiny which i could have gotten over once it was on but the arm holes were just awful too big all around too tall of a cut plus too wide of a cut basically you could see my bra plus from the front there was unflattering exposure near the armholes it could have been so good but alas but t
2,this dress had an odd fit very loose on top with pointy darts very tight on bottom fabric was stiff so it didnt move well with me
2,worst product
2,if youre a fan of story and build up this show is a wonderful binge its funny and terrifying its thought provoking but doesnt provide immediate fireworks its the definition of a slow burn it builds and builds and builds and builds its more accurately described as a horror show for anyone with a functioning uterus in america its too plausible not to be terrifying and unfortunately a textbook for how to control and own women instead of women with actual functioning reproductive organs being reverted and actually protected they are enslaved and owned there are too many political coincidences lately not to make comparisons to todays political situation in america its a warning to women everywhere but even more so a call to men to stand up and not allow these atrocities to become reality
2,i have quite dry skin on my face and this toner didnt help with the dryness i felt it dried out my skin even more and left my face feeling tight and overall unpleasant but maybe this its just certain skin types that it might be better for this review was collected as part of a promotion
2,so sad becuase i like the design i would not recomend the lack to anyone that does not live and work and shop in a completely immaculate environment i wore this to work the day after purchasing and within three hours i honestly looked like i had slept in this sweater for three monthe straight i had to take the sweater off and work in a tshirt the marigold color may be better than the black abut showing lint but something intrinsic to the fabric really attracts lint like nothing i have eve
2,very small and not for usable waste of money
2,im always looking for pieces that would good for either layering or worn alone this looks cute on the model but when i received it its actually very flowing i wanted more of a straight cut doesnt work very well on my body im lbs d its going back
2,the dialogue in unreal and unbearable a group of miserable people in a paradise setting who bring all their baggage on a getaway what kind of parents put up with the constant attack from their woke kids run save yourself
2,wanted to love this dress bit it wasnt to be strange fit and doesnt drape nicely as in the photo also the blue color was much darker in person wouldnt recommend
2,this blouse is so beautiful the collar sleeves materialeverything except the cut it was like a tent it needed to be more tapered which would be easy to do while still maintaining the beautiful breezy flow and be about two inches longer i had been drooling over this top for awhile and was so disappointed please fix it and then i will buy again i am lbs and bustya small was perfect with the exception of the massive amount of material
2,this was very bland and didnt have enought cream cheese would not make it again
2,the lace and fit were good but the length seemed awkward to me given how boxy and flowyish the dress is it felt like a baby doll with sleeves or something and i hated the outside middle material hated it it felt cheap and odd when compared to the lace maybe i was just not in the right demographic for this piece
2,the material is adorable and if it was available in a blouse with sleeves i would buy in a minute we have a pool and i thought it would be cute to wear while entertaining now the cons i am long waisted and this strange tie knotted high under the bustline giving an odd lumpy look it runs short and i cant imagine who thought this design was a good idea there were no reviews when i ordered i am learning to try it on in the store andor read the reviews before investing i would say go up a
2,i normally wear a medium with these types of fabrics but this one was oddly proportioned on me the skirt was also not very flattering to my hourglass figure but it at least fit well the top was baggy and gaped at the armpits as stated by others i really wanted to like this dress but it made me look pounds heavier even in the places it looked too big on me i could have tried going with a small but the skirt would have then been too short
2,this sweater was just okay i am happy to pay or more for a sweater but this one was somewhat itchy and not the quality i expected for that price i may have kept it if it were at about half the price but it just was not worth it retailer prices seem to be going up and up and the quality less and less i had similar experiences with a couple of shirts that i ordered over the summer looked great in the photos but unfortunately in person were not quality garments
2,the top ran too large and it made me look more bustier than i am and rounder in my midsection by how it fell on me maybe wouldve been better for someone with a smaller bust the quality of the fabric was just okay
2,i was so excited to order this dress had the perfect red shoes to go with it unfortunately i could have been nine months pregnant and still wear the small i am lb and it was like a maternity dress sad to send it back
2,these are very pretty but i have had a few problems with them out of the package i found them to be true to size i think i purchased the pxxs or the pxs however even though they are machine washable i feel that they shrunk upon washing and are now too short i am barely over tall also the elastic waistband keeps twisting within the casing which drives me crazy i have to keep straightening it i think there are better options for sleep pants
2,i wanted to love this kimonoit is such a beautiful color and would work well with so many things in my wardrobe but alas it went back due to the strange feel of the fabricnot a soft touch and because it runs small i bought the ml and usually wear a but i couldnt bring the kimono together in the front for a belting option
2,i generally dont like action series but reacher is just great it has good source material and alan if i close my eyes thats what i look like in my mind he makes the whole thing work its just an awesome guy doing awesome things all the damn time with a good storyline to back it up and when you think it doesnt get more awesome it does in the next scene like a compounding awesomeness plot twist i just cant find a better word than awesome it is the awesomest description of itself i honestly have not read the books yet even though i bought some but having seen the series first i am worried it will not be the same because alan is just such a good fit for the character and the action is so well done i am not sure i could imagine it better i always read the books first if an interesting series or movie is published based on a book books are just better this seems to be the exception although maybe i should actually read a reacher book but hell this just has me smiling like a fool for episodes and there is scarcely anything that can do that so lets keep it going please
2,i have purchased many dresses from retailer for weddings and events this is the first time i have been disappointed with the quality however the sleeve on this dress ripped after lifting up my toddler son in the middle of a wedding the size seemed to fit perfectly but the fabric had no give it was not overly tight in the bust as i am bra size aa for the price i expected better the color and style of the dress is gorgeous so perhaps ordering one size up is the answer
2,like the other reviewer said this top is extremely wide and boxy it must be pinned in the picture online its very frustrating when they do that thank goodness i didnt pay for shipping for reference im and pounds and bought the xxs its going back for sure im trying to lose baby weight not trying to look pregnant
2,what a slog those episodes were to get through i love the character of wednesday and the addams family as a whole especially as portrayed in the first two s films but only the first half of the first episode of this series captures the spirit of wednesday addams for me in those first minutes wednesday delivers such crisp snappy irreverent dialogue that i thought wow this is amazing i cant believe how good this is but it doesnt last the character is played well by ortega but the writing quickly veers away from what makes her and the addams so cool and instead drives down a one way street filled with childish teen drama eventually they even kind of give up trying to make wednesday unusual she starts wearing increasingly normal clothes develops close friendships with a shockingly large number of classmates becomes more emotional and well increasingly normal it becomes this bland mix of harry potter and the recent sabrina reboot with an extra dash of netflixs politics for good measure a supernatural teen drama show littered with forgettable side characters clichéd childlike plot lines a tedious love triangle yes really and cheesy dialogue peppered with trite political slogans its so far away from the quirky kooky irreverent gothic deadpan macabre sarcastic ironic and surprisingly wellfunctioning family unit we know and love that its almost offensive instead we have a resentful wednesday a weirdly frosty and controlling morticia a corpulent gomez who has zero chemistry with morticia an afterthought of a pugsly and an almost nonexistent lurch he does look the part at least only thing is really nailed the new design of the hand is cool and hes amusing dutiful and endearing as a character funny how theres more character in that choppedoff hand than almost all other characters besides wednesday for the three highlights ortegas acting thing and some funny oneliners from wednesday most of which happen in the first episode everything else shouldve been sent back to the drawing board
2,not a coat by any means merely a thin wool boucle like sweater with a cheap thin synthetic lining and i also would never want the lining to be seen by anyone if i were to set the sweater on a chair or be helped in putting the thing on the length and bulk is hard to layer under anything else and isnt pretty enough for a spring coatsizing is also sizes larger than anticipated
2,i just got this in the mail the other day i was really excited and then crushed one buttons go all the way down and not what is in the photo it takes it from hip whimsy to granny old lady sweater and then the minute i put it on it started pilling it looked old and i wore it about hours i also used the roller lint remover on it and it pulled off one of the eyes on the snail it is soft and felt comfy but look raggy and therefore it is going back too bad but not what i bought and then not
2,the color design and fabric of this top got it in the red were just as i expected but as the owner of several deletta brand tops i was very surprised to find that my usual size small runs very large in this tank not only did the front dip too low but so did the arm holes and the top just hangs on me it was so big for a small that it almost made me think it had been mislabeled and was really a size large bummed to return it because i really love the color and the style will try an xs
2,made this today for supper and was somewhat disappointed it wasnt as flavorful as i thought it would be i have to wonder about all the folks who thought it was delicious i would rate this recipe as not that great and somewhat below average
2,super cute but the fabric was so thin flimsy i was afraid it would fall apart once it was washed so returned it
2,display spot very bad buy
2,i bought this dress for a holiday party and the sequins on the dress were so much more blue that what it looks like in the photo i still liked it but when i went to try it on it was just not working i thought this was more of a loosely fitted look but the upper bodice and waist seam are very tightly fitted i would recommend sizing up but be aware that the top straps shoulder to breast are too loose to begin with so they may sag overall i wouldnt recommend this dress for the curren
2,two episodes in and the show is already a classic in terms of acting visuals soundtrack etc its so faithful to the source material and as a die hard fan of the game the nostalgia hits hard some reviews say that the third episode is one of the if not the best of the series even though its probably the episode that will derive from the original story the most im really glad that we have access to much more content in the story that didnt make it through the original game such as the background relationship between bill frank ellies mom etc the visuals are stunning each scene is a chefs kiss of visual and practical effects and the clickers feel so real its almost frightening
2,this jacket looked adorable on it was also quite comfortable however it sheds and left fuzz on every dark surface it touched sadly this is a deal breaker for me
2,i thought this was adorable on the model but not so much on me i actually didnt mind it when i tried it on with a long cardigan but i didnt want to keep it for look the material felt inexpensive the shape was very unflattering for an average sized women like myself im and about lbs
2,very basic as it states i added chocolate chips and they still turned out very dense wont make again
2,this looks so gorgeous on the model on the site so i ordered it online it was incredibly frumpy when i tried it on looks like i took a floor rug cut a hole in the middle and slipped it over my head the sweater itself is so pretty its just too bad it falls so awkwardly on me i normally wear a small so i ordered the xss and the sleeves still fall past my thumbs its kind of itchy too will be returning this asap
2,does not look like the picture lined with a cheap denim fabric inside that shows when arms are rolled up i normally always fit in mediums and this jacket is so small in the arms as well as body that it fit like a xs
2,it hangs very nicely on the model in the picture but when i put it on it fit tight in the sleeves and upper back but huge in the front the sweater was also sparkly which made it look cheap i loved the lace detail in the back but the sweater was returned did not fit well and was not good quality very thin
2,i bought the red motiff in my usual size of xxs petite and it was huge at first i thought they had mistakenly sent the wrong size but this was sadly not the case the fit is definitely sacklike as other reviewers mentioned i had to return
2,im happy the other reviewers made this dress work because it looked terrible on me im and lbs and it made me look like i had gained lbs as others have said the pockets make the dress even worseits very hard to get them to lay flat the material is lovely soft and i liked the gray color but this dress made me feel like i was wearing something from an asylum
2,they absolutely nailed every single aspect ive been a big fan for a long time reacher books are mental popcorn and this tv represents exactly what i wanted from a show also gotta say they cast the absolutely best person for reacher its so nice to see these folks listened to the fans who were so upset about tom cruise give it a watch if youre a fan anyone expecting anything more is a pretentious waste of time reacher is a no nonsense character and this guy nails it
2,i didnt like the smell its not bad but its not a pleasant one i dont even used it till the end because i started noticing that my hair was very dry every time i used it stoped using it and my hair is back no normal now
2,this top is on the boxy side but the design is cute and i love the pink color the problem i had with this shirt is the huge arm holes one side you could see the top of my bra the other side was below the side of my bra you could also see the inside back of the shirt through this arm hole it was that big this went back will not reorder i usually order xs or xsp this was an xsp
2,best star wars content i have ever seen bit conflicted to rate this above mandalorian but this deserves it perfect pacing of story which gives a satisfying ending to season this hits close to home as well which is why i can say it successfully captures what goes in the minds of people living under a corrupt and authoritarian government this show thrives without any jedi force powers fan service and etc what it brings to the table are realistic behavior and reactions from any party involved specially empire feels way more competent and frightening than ever before this goes for stormtroopers as well so what are you waiting for go ahead and watch it you wont be disappointed
2,wow this is the best show ive seen in awhile it is dark creative well scripted and intriguing i cant wait for the second season the best netflix show i have seen jenna ortega is excellent it took me awhile to watch it and when i did i cant stop i love the dark path it goes down wednesday is witty clever and unique extremely well done tim burton did a great job i am only on episode and i figure out who the bad person is the show does a great job disguising it wonderful cast i havent given a review of a ten before everything in this show works i have zero complaints cant wait for season
2,it heat a lot and problem with display when pop up arise it lower it brightness step by step and problem with wifi wifi icon and drivers disappear waste of money it better to go for leonovo ideapad gaming that i have bought for my sister that is working phenomenal
2,i really wanted to love this shirt the colors are gorgeous very vibrant and just as shown the fit was all wrong on me i ordered the petite xxs and it was still too boxy and it kept shifting so the front collar of the shirt would ride up into my neck it looked like a sack on me for reference i am lbswith a small frame
2,i own other cloth and stone tops and always love the softness of the material this one missed the mark not soft and very thick not what i was expecting
2,when i saw this online i immediately put it on my must buy list i hate paying the exorbitant shipping fees retailer charges so i was waiting until i could get to my local store in the meantime it looks like it has sold out online but i am sure it will be back in stock soon luckily my bm store had it and i am so glad i didnt waste my money or time ordering it online this could have been great but once again antho missed the mark what the product shot online doesnt show is that it has dol
2,the cars seemed great but occasionally the card is suddenly not formatted even without writing new data to it has happened in multiple devicesi lost some video i cant rerecord on it and am fairly upsetsome forums say that the early runs of these cards did that occasionally and that it has been fixed on new runs but i find it difficult to trust them now i have never had this problem with any sandisk product before including the of these cards i have in gbvery disappointed
2,so heating whan do work matter i dont know sound very poor
2,i really wanted to love this shirt the fit was great and the fabric just felt beautiful luxurious soft and flowing but the collar was frayed in addition the little keyhole area fabric also had to be carefully handled to make it look smooth and not like bad workmanship i put it aside to return it then this morning went to have another look at it wanting to talk myself back into it but i cant overlook the fact id be ordering a new shirt that would look timeworn it may be only this
2,i wanted to like this coat so bad i loved the bright red color and design but when i received it it seemed very cheap and just too large i returned it
2,id give this series a but it had a few nonsensical plot issues minor wouldnt happen that way things and what was obvious to me of who did what not going to do a spoiler that being said i thoroughly enjoyed each action packed episode the writingdialogue were top notch as well as the stellar sound effects and cinematography to complete a well crafted product many times i felt actual fear and trepidation during unfolding events i will keep my eyes peeled for a season two and look forward to binge watching the next series as soon as they are available
2,had to return this for a couple of reasons was too small its made like one of those tiny mittens that stretches to fit any size hand i didnt bother to order a size up because i wasnt sure whether to go from a small to a medium or to a large the main color isnt grey like the picture its a black and white checkered pattern so it doesnt look at all grey irl im still recommending because if you get the right size and like the colors it will be a nice light and comfy swea
2,i did not like this top at allbut had i looked at the fabric prior to purchasing i would not have it is polyesteri thought it was cotton so theres the first reason i didnt like it secondly there is a piece of fabric behind the laces presumably for modesty that refuses to lay flat it wrinkles up behind the lacing making it appear as if one is wearing an undershirt or cami that is not appropriate for the top it is too long for me the top hitting at top of thigh this top is just reall
2,like other reviewers have said this item runs extremely long and large i could have fit my body in one pant leg they were so widemuch wider than any standard wide leg pant ive owned sadly had to return
2,i had hoped this blouse would be white but it is cream in color it was also more boxy than i thought it would be i am usually a or a and went with the a size would be a better fit
2,touchpad fingerprint sensor built in quality is too bad it forced me to use mouse and also charger built in quality is also too bad
2,i bought this toner recently and broke me out in tiny bumps i love simples products its such a shame i admit i have extremely sensitive skin but no other product so do this
2,i really wanted to like these but they just didnt look right on my sorta bulky frame i have big thighs and always feel out of place wearing leggings so maybe im just not the right target for these but they looked so cute and i wanted to give them a try the waist was too high for my liking and the leg openings were too big and gave me a stumpified look
2,got this for galaxy note started receiving unexpectedly removed messages now card is dead and no longer working this can be googled for known issues will be contacting amazon for replacement felt compelled to share
2,no recommendation very noize work expensive battery maximum hours dont have usb no good not comfortable keyboard
2,i just received my backordered wildberry top in blue its not blue but instead a dull mottled purplish hue it looks like a wellworn stretched out tee shirt with a tired ruffle along the bottom so disappointing its going back for sure
2,i was a huge fan of these lovely swing dresses from last year and bought all colors when i saw this new one i was thrilled and ordered it immediately what a disappointment why did isabella sinclair mess with a good thing the fabric is a very loose weave sort of homespun look which wouldnt be a deal breaker but i could see it would be very vulnerable to snags last years styles had a removable light knit full slip that allowed the airy fabrics to move this version is fully lined yo
2,heres an example of lowering a hemline and slapping the term petite on it too much fabric was bulky and ran too small the fabric was thin and pulled awkwardly over the bust returned
2,i ordered this in the plum color which in real life just looks like a very very dark brown that would probably be okay but the dress is actually about inches shorter than the listed measurements i ordered the regular length but the shortest part of the hem hits me only about halfway down my thighway way too short i am for reference lastly i think the fabric is just awful quality especially for this price point the slight texture makes it want to cling to itself worn ou
2,smells lovely but it was all a lot smaller than i expected for the price its half the price in supermarkets for the sizes you get on amazon
2,waste of money you have too many choices in this amount
2,laptop is ok good quality and design performance is really for both gaming just missing fingerprint sensor only good for office and coding use valorant runs on fps max with lag on low graphics
2,this is only for children study
2,i got these in the mail today and to me they look exactly like the pants my mamaw used to wear in the s they were super comfy but not cute at all on me they do run large like other reviews say i am usually an or med and these in the small were the right choice going back because they just look horrible on me though
2,i really wanted to like this jump suit i rarely have problem with retailer clothing im hourglass shape usually wear size this jumpsuit runs small but thats not the only problem top part shirt piece of the jumpsuit is too short so its digging into my lady part the color does not look anything like the picture so overall this piece is failure i hope that i find something similar but fits better
2,the dress is just ok i cannot imagine having paid full price for this i got it for florida vacation i put it on to wear to church first and spilled a drop of lavender oil on it and it stained cant get it out thats punk for a dress that even on sale is like sending back
2,reacher is a crime thriller action series based on the jack reacher book series this is a very ss style action fuelled crime drama there is no cgi and such this is all about guns and muscles alan ritchson as reacher is the endowment of an unstoppable force of nature the casting is really good with all the side characters my favorite being maria sten as frances neagley the plot is about reacher a retired u s army military policeman visiting a rural town and being accused of murder he uses his detective and fighting skills to go about solving the case as he digs deeper the scope of the crime becomes bigger and more personnel a very entertaining watch really looking forward to season two
2,i wanted to love this dress and did from the picture online when it arrived the black already looked faded and old also the embroidery looks like a grandma but not in a cute vintage way the fabric is stiff which causes a boxy unflattering look had to return it
2,i was so excited to get this dress and it was such a disappointment it looks so cute on the model but it was very different when i got it the color is a lot more yellow than i thought it would be and the pattern just looked a bit strangeit stood out more against the yellow instead of looking neutral the dress fit really awkwardly on the top the straps were way too long and the chest area was practically baggy when i put it on i normally wear a p and i ordered down to a p the waist
2,the top is nice good quality etc but how do you keep the off the shoulder off the shoulder mine keeps inching up until its just a boring white top with a strange loose neckline
2,beware white is not white white is more cream offwhite light beige i was really looking forward to these shorts but was immediately disappointed when i saw the color they are cute but not white i bought them to wear with the nautical look tops for this summer but unfortunately creamy colored shorts dont do much for navywhite topsalso the button is very difficult to opencloseotherwise they are ok
2,not working
2,i ordered these in both colors the red is much deeper in person more like a burgundy than pictured here these tees are very slouchy if you wanted a more fitted look size down these are very soft and very comfy and will pair well with ponte leggings and skinny jeans the overall quality seems very good although they are thinner than i thought they would be they seemed like they would be thick and stiff to me based on the photos overall these are very nice but there is one is
2,loved this shirt when i saw the picture unfortunately fit was not what it needed to be to keep it you cant really see in the photo but if you have any chest at all i am only bso would say of average size bust this shirt will not fit well there is a seam in the bust area that cuts across the bust which is not flatteringdoesnt fit well the sleeves were also a bit more tight than id have thought from the photo really wanted to love this but unless you have a smaller chest it lik
2,looks great on the photo and from previous reviews i decided to give it a try the material seems cheap and stiff would not fit my frame well
2,andor is not just the best that disney has accomplished with star wars its one of the bestwritten science fiction series in recent years from start to finish the show provides us with a slowburning characterdriven narrative that is downtoearth emotionally resonant and politically incisive what sets andor apart is its incredible character development you dont just watch these characters you understand them relate to their cause and observe them grow the emotional richness is authentic and unpretentious cassians transformation from being a reluctant survivor to being a committed revolutionary is done so skillfully that it always rings true every step of the way the series perfectly delves into rebellions genesis not in gleaming battles or jedi mysticism but in the quiet dangerous work of ordinary folk pushed to the edge the storytelling is linear but layered showing the cost of resistance and the courage it requires to fight oppression andor is not only for fans of star wars it speaks to a much broader audience its allegories evoke real corruption totalitarianism and domination of society its full of subtle but forceful commentary on how authoritarian dictatorships are formed and how the uprisings against them are born out of disparity and need this is star wars storytelling in its most grownup most relevant and most compelling form a mustsee
2,the display is bad audio is slow
2,i ordered this memory card because obviously i needed more space on my phone one of the reasons why i prefer android to apple products is it is way easier to upgrade storage space with android my memory card arrived when i expected it to and now i have more than enough space on my galaxy s i once gave this product a five star and everything before this sentence is the review from when i was satisfied with it but now im having problems i cant delete stuff of of the sd card i tried formatting it on both my phone and my computer but nothing well delete so now im giving it a two star
2,i purchased this top in the black and tan color loved the fit style and fabric however it is a loose weave and after just one wearing a hole opened up on the front which could not be repaired it was covered by the cowl neck collar but as the day wore on the hole got bagger and it can no longer be hidden i was very disappointed in the quality of this top i purchased it at full price and was only able to wear it once i just didnt have the time to return it to the store
2,not a good product waste of money no support from the e commerce and laptop company buy another brand which is not indian
2,this dress looks very beautiful on the model shown unfortunately when i tried it on it did not flow as nicely as i would have liked it to i also didnt care much for the waist ties on the side an elastic waist might have been better
2,not a big fan of dove it doesnt have much of a wow factor i feel clean after using but based off commercials i cant help but feel disappointed especially for the price point i dont recommend this
2,wanted to like this type cute print something about the width and length of this top didnt work on me was a little boxy im lbs size xss might be cuter on different body type im hourglass and athletic
2,i wanted to love this top but when i received the picture on the website is a dark charcoal almost black and the grey that you order is much much lighter grey in addition this shirt is super boxy thus why the model probably is pinning her elbows to her side to bring the top in going back disappointed
2,this is a very lovely looking sweater unfortunately it runs incredibly small im only and the size small hit me above my midrise jeans it doesnt fit at all how its shown on the model its also a very delicate fabric seems like it would snag easily i was really hoping it would work as i used my birthday discount to purchase it but im sending it back
2,bad product after month from baing its not working
2,sound quality is very bad
2,it is definitely pinned back on the model in the photograph it made my foot frame look short and wide
2,this dress looked super cute in the picture and on the model i ordered the petite style and it was still so big and way too loose no shape whatsoever i unfortunately had to return it i love loose dresses but this one was way too big loose and had no shape at all
2,very disappointed that i ordered this dress and a large was too big returned and asked for an exchange to a size medium it was apparently not available in the medium i was charged a fee for return shopping so i immediately went to website medium available and i had to pay another for shipping seems a bit unreasonable but really liked the dress
2,same old tired cliche of characters all are unlikable and one dimensional not to mention very predictable
2,i was so excited for this dress to arrive but when it did it was a major disappointment there is no lining on the skirt portion of the dress leaving it sheer also the top part along the chest puckered in a weird unflattering way the colors were beautiful but not enough to to make up for the other design flaws i am lb and the small fit tts will be sending it back
2,crew stripe sheath fitted very well until i turned around the waist section where the stripes wrap around the waist had extra fabric and didnt lay well i am lbs c waist and hip usually wear a or extra small in the maeve clothing that isnt a fitted style i bought the s which fit well except for the waist issue described above this is a fitted dress i hope this is just an issue with the dress i received it is a great style idea
2,amazing to see some calling this a masterpiece a blend of the comments are correct the acting is great but its essentially a higher than average budget soap certainly watchable but could have been brilliant would have loved to have seen some back stories and their rise to power over a longer succession of episodes building the characters like all the modern greats have ill always remember it as a series that boasted talent most feature films would envy and were let down by the bbc writers
2,used it in my galaxy note for the past months all the sudden it is no longer writable i tried many ways to reformat the card even windows says format successful but all files remain after i remove and reinsert the card since i have private files in the card im not able to delete i do not want to sent it back to sandisk for replacement
2,processing is slow i need some compensation or refund for that i thought it well be processing well but not to expectations
2,battery backup is very very bad
2,sorry to say but i have to pull down rating from to the card went bad in just couple of months no option to return as its beyond policythe card came on time good packaging and works so what else to add for this gb sd card
2,if you have any cleavage this dress will look awful the ties drop pretty low look trashy over cleavage recommend otherwise good fabric cool look
2,oh such a classic retailer look for summer a vintage pattern on a crisp cotton fabric i was immediately drawn to it but wait there is a sort of wrap around tie at the waist creating the look of an apron yes it looks like one is wearing a full apron or scrub dress why this would have been sooo much better as a simple shift or a skirtblouse combo
2,i tried this blouse on in the store im generally an or in this brand i got down to a size and gave up this blouse is huge all the way around the detail on the blouse is pretty but the tent like cut made it impossible for me to buy it i know retailers blouses can be swingy and flows but this went way beyond perhaps on a tall person the swing would work but on a short person like myselfi looked ridiculous
2,i used this product with my dell venue pro after a couple months of use it stopped letting me add new files or delete old onesi tried reformatting and wiping the disk but nothing worked since the vast majority of the reviews appear to be positive i assume i just got a bad one
2,i agree that this shirt is boxy and has no shape it doesnt look at all like it does on the model i returned it
2,im and the xs swallowed me like a snuggie i suppose the tons of fabric might drape nicely if youre and above it drooped and hung comically large from every angle under arm body and skirt a belt was no match for that much fabric the colors are gorgeous and it appeared well made but the design was awful
2,this isnt cornbreadmore like cake but then im from the south
2,bad battey backup
2,purchased these as they were cheap but i really had forgotten how bad they taste its like chewing an old wet rope i hope the kids like them because thats what theyre having when they get home from school ha ha ha of course i will lie and say they taste great
2,the xs was too large on me and im not a tiny person while the dress was beautiful on the model in person it had way too much fabric and fit rather tentlike the fabric is gorgeous and the dress would have worked if it were more of a fitted style and had half the amount of fabric on the bottom not flattering at all
2,been using this for a year very happy last cans the nozzles have blocked within a week cant clear them with hot water bit disappointed
2,i am not sure what happened to these cards but i have owned several and they stop working quickly i sent a message to sandisk and never heard back very disappointing
2,in paper crown dresses i wear a small or size so for this top i ordered a small it was huge on me for reference im lbs a it is very wide towards the bottom and it flares out way more than in the picture the material is also a little stiff so it really sticks out even if i sized down to the xs i think the bottom would still look unflattering so im returning this
2,this hoodie was too thin you can see right through it i returned it
2,its beautiful lovely quality gorgeous bird but the fit just doesnt work for me im usually a medium which is what i got its just too tight in the chest for ref d as is it already flares out some in the bottom so im not gonna bother w a larger size unfortunately
2,keyord button quality very poor
2,this has such awful proportions im and lbs ordered xxs petite in the neutral color the seam at the bust literally hits in the middle of my bust it looks very unflattering and its very pronounced im only and already the seam hits at such a high point on me below the seam the sweater is all scrunched up where its sewed and it balloons outward and is very square from there down very shapeless sweater and not flattering at all unless you have your arms by your sides to hi
2,every white character with the exception of rachel was a despicable lowlife the rest are honorable victims i really wanted to like this but i guess that hbo has granted itself the moral authority to preach instead of entertain the four stars are for the goddess alexandra and her bikini
2,i agree with the other review the fabric and pattern are adorable and well made the fabric is not sheer at all and great qualityhowever the shirt is very wide i am a and the small is way too big the arm holes are perfect but the bottom is uncomfortably large and awkward in appearance
2,i absolutely fell in love with these comfy palazzo pants and imagined that id be wearing them all summer long they fit beautifully were true to size and seemed to go with every top i owned unfortunately on the second wear the inseam completely unraveled leaving a footlong gaping hole in the leg i also noticed some stray threads along the other seams so im not thrilled with the quality it seems like they were poorly manufactured im not sure if i just purchased a faulty pair or if t
2,im not sure if the top i received was damaged or if the design didnt consider gravity but this is not what i expected i really want to like this top but i dont see how i can wear it
2,the material is very nice not flimsy at all which is nice the problem was the fit around the arms i am a petite person with a small chest but it still didnt cover me bra ill be returning it
2,i love off the shoulder looks and had high hopes for this top unfortunately the folded top portion doesnt stay down at all i found myself pulling at it all day and eventually gave up the material is also not the best
2,i ordered first the green then the grey in case the green was mismarked so short is this to be in keeping with the ankle pant trend anyone who wants a shorter pant could easily hem them but there is no way to lengthen them i held the new pants up to an older pair from previous years they are a full inches shorter wow note how in the photo of the golden color pants they barely skim the models ankle thats how they are in real life i wear these pants in a tall and live
2,first time i didnt have correct size pan and they turned out well second time i used correct size pan and there wasnt enough carmel to cover i gave the recipe to others and they both failed and dumped it flavor was good but did not turn out as expected
2,never buying again about of the capsules were all stuck together and leaking making them unusable canceling my subscription
2,enough with the crying monica dutton please stop making this woman a pathetic crying drone every time shes on the show i have to fast foward because i know its going to be poor me poor me jamie dutton truly creeps me out i mean everything about him makes my skin crawl hahaha i love everything about beth and rip rip is a truly hard man but treats his wife like a queen even though shes crazyhehe this is what most women want a tough man that absolutely adores his wife this last season is getting a little tiring with same old same old lacking in luster from the last few seasons ill continue to watch but if this continues they may need to end it there ill move on to new series on the duttons looks pretty good so far
2,i made this added fresh spinach green pepper and mushrooms used a swissgruyere cheese combo and some cheddar it still was very bland and i think that was due to the potatoes which really need to be cooked first in order to have any flavor otherwise the potatoes just overpower everything else in it
2,battery very poor
2,i tried a size x small on in the store and i am lbs i had trouble getting my head through the dress and once i did it felt so tight at the neck as if it was chocking me the dress color is very nice but the tight neck and odd arm holes were a no i would not recommend this dress for those reasons
2,the recipe was blend so i ate dried herbs more salt onion and garlic powder after doing that it was amazing
2,this top runs extremely large and has a very unflattering cut for those without a straight figure i have ddd boobs and a muscular curvy frame this top adds about lbs
2,i purchased this and another eva franco dress during retailers recent off sale i was looking for dresses that were work appropriate but that would also transition well to happy hour or date night they both seemed to be just what i was looking for i ordered a regular and a regular as i am usually in between sizes the was definitely too small the fit technically but was very ill fitting not only is the dress itself short but it is very shortwaisted i am only but it fe
2,this last episode has given me enough reason to cancel my disney subscription disney stuff is not for everyone anymore and thats ok this show has taken a completely different direction it became very apparent earlier this season that the protagonist is becoming a side character does baby yoda purr he did for lizzo for some reason did she direct this episode because it feels like she might have and jack black well jack black is just jack black or also possibly the director disney is not capable of releasing quality original content and is systematically dismantling the shows that did work might be a good time to sell that stock if you have any because oof
2,this is one of the lowest quality shirts i have ever received from retailer i was so excited for the shirt it looked so pretty and soft in the pictures the flax is very scratchy marring the softness of the rest of the fabric the top half is totally sheer requiring a cami the shirt is cut in such a way that it flares out from the rib cafe in an unstructured way unnecessarily adding visual pounds finally the sewing is done very poorly and the the side tag is literally three inches longwh
2,i thought it was just ok wont make again
2,like most people here i wanted this beautiful dress to fit so i decided to see for myself if maybe just maybe the negative reviews were wrong they werent if you have any sort of breasts at all the top probably wont fit properly i imagine a narrow upper torso like a or possibly a might find the top part of the dress closes properly but with a c i could not get a size to button up the waist hit at a strange spot and despite the picture showing a narrow waist and grad
2,i bought the gb i u variant the laptops performance is very bad when the charger is not plughed in using multiple apps gets very laggy but as soon as the charger is plugged in the performance improves by x this is very weird i tried using the performance mode and disabled all the battery optimizations but this does not make any difference its very frustrating when you have plug in the charger every time you want to do some moderate level tasks
2,i have had this recipe for a couple of years amp needed a meatless casserole so made it i should have read the reviews it had way too much sauce my husband liked it and that is the only reason i would ever make it again if there is a next time ill use twice as much macaroni and bake it in a x baking dishhad way too much sauce
2,it heats up so fast and battery life is kind of short
2,this top is well made and would be cute but huge this top has no shape and is way big back this goesj
2,i am and pounds with an athletic cury body type the dress wore bulky and ran large at size
2,battery backup is very poor hardly hr running after full charge
2,i purchased this shirt in white and black the white is more ivoryisn and is a bit thinsee through the shirts can be worn with jeans or dressed up with a skirt i just wish it was a little more form fitting i do like the hint of stretch in the fabric very comfortable as well
2,runs large and it also had a small hole in the back had to return it
2,this totally fell apart when i tried to take it out of the pan after min of cooling i had greased the pan and it did come out but it came out a total mess i followed the directions to the letter
2,i have been looking for an offwhite vest and thought this one would be perfect except it is going back i am lbs medium is my normal top size but this medium was tight even though the design looks relaxed in the picture no buttons so no way to close it unlined and the design and fabric look more casual than the photo not worth the price
2,the shirt is absolutely cute looking but thats just thatlooks im size wears m to l top i tried on the medium in the store it was rather flowing i liked it but i didnt like how it fit on the underarm area it hung very low so i ordered a petite m still the same plus the store the lighting was dark so i didnt realize how see through the shirt was too had to return it
2,looks much nicer in the photo i expected a much higher quality fabric this fabric truly felt cheap i expected a nicer dress for the price the fit was unflattering on me sent it back
2,i loved this top it was my go to top even in the heat the fabric is light and breathes however pulled it out of the washing mashing to find that the sleeve has shredded away from the body it could not be repaired i am so disappointed as i really loved everything about it
2,while this smelled lovely and was very pleasant to apply it lasted a morning before failing to protect
2,dont buy this laptop a terrible piece of just go for other laptops that are way more reliable if you have a money tree then go ahead
2,worst experience in this laptop customer support and samsung service center support very wrost service dont buy this people they are testing our patience almost calls i done to samsung customer support they are not responding properlydont buy this laptop
2,i saw this dress online and loved the colors and whimsical embroidery i thought it would be the perfect dress to wear on the weekend with cute sandals i was excited when the dress arrived in the mail as the colors were vibrant and the material was soft and cozy unfortunately this dress is huge it is a rectangle with pockets i bought the xxsp my usual size and this dress was so big my sister was able to fit in it with methis dress was beyond alterations too bad it was a great idea but no
2,i have a few evening functions this month and the next few months and i thought this dress would be different and fun i really wanted to like it but i could not there were spots missing sequence some fell off as i tried the dress on and i did try it on twice each time there were some on the floor they are sewed on so poorly for the price of this dress i fear it would be a dress for one season and id have to throw it out not for that price so back it goes
2,was just ok for us we felt like it was missing flavor just needed something probably wont make again
2,this is a gorgeous print but i found it too fussy for my taste it is quite shapeless so i tried doing a half tuck it looked cute for about seconds but then i had to worry about keeping the shoulders down
2,im worried about the quality of the shirt it looks like it may snag easily ive decided to keep it so hopefully i will get some use out of it in hindsight i would have not bought it when considering the price and quality of the shirt
2,i agree with the other reviews runs small would have been perfect if it actually was comfortable waistband doesnt stretch all the way around bummer
2,these leggings are loose fitting and the quality is just not there i am returning the item
2,this is a very slimming wellmade nice fitting topi just disliked the colors they did not look good on me otherwise this is a very nice piece
2,the wife and i started watching this on netflix while surfing around looking for something that might be interesting from the beginning i enjoyed the way it was filmed and the subject matter while she was a bit indifferent to it but the more i watched the more interested she got in the story lines and now were both hooked yeah its a bit farfetched at times but its hard to find anything of this nature that isnt and we just overlook it for the most part because we enjoy the suspense however some of the criticisms ive read from other users that i agree with are the music can get very loud and annoying the difficulty understanding some of the accents for an american ear i had to keep trying to interpret for my wife but even i had trouble with some especially tom hardys and paul andersons so we just started watching with the cc turned on much better now adrien brodys godfatherlike portrayal of his character i keep waiting for him to make an offer they cant refuse annabell wallis nose job from season to looks like a completely different person the apelike gait of arthur i keep expecting him to start swinging from the trees the overuse of slow motion nonetheless well keep watching edit for season ill leave my rating as is but id give season a at best its all style and little substance and too many things make no sense the blinders must have one hell of an intelligence network that is never alluded to too many slow scenes and the music has become even more annoying its also apparently eternally foggy wherever they are regardless of country and was that the creature from predator i saw in the one scene in the last episode
2,ive been making cheeseburger chowder for years my recipe is betterbut nice attempt lol velveeta
2,i was so excited to receive this jumpsuit as it looks so elegant and i love the lattice back as soon as it arrived i set about unbuttoning it to try it on minutes and broken fingernails later i got done when i tried it on i found that it fit everywhere except the bust which was much too tight and i am not a busty person so back it goes even if it had fit i do not think i could have handled the hassle of those buttons why they didnt design it with a hidden zipper on the side and kept
2,battery backup not good
2,wondering how i can get that back but seriously im angry at myself for giving it a chance
2,i was so excited to try this on in the store because ive had my eye on it online unfortunately it is not like the picture the material is very thin almost translucent i also could not figure out how it get it on the cape has short sleeves not long as it appears in the picture and the folds of fabric would not drape quite right in the front love the look of black design on white hopefully retailer can redo this in a thicker cape for the fall but for now ill skip this one
2,after one month hdmi cable card is not working
2,unfortunately this one is going back the fit is very flattering and the underlying layer is very revealing in the back
2,display quality is very bad battery is ok not good always go for ips full hd display
2,i wanted to love this dress but it has too many flaws first the waistband falls right under the bust and the skirt flares out from there not a flattering silhouette second the fabric is a sickly yellowbeige netting that looks like burlap third i cant imagine what kind of bra you can wear under it on the plus side the fabric isnt scratchy
2,this show captures your interest and holds it through the end with both seasons are there normal families and relationships or in reality are they all troubled probably the latter and the writer vividly portrays that with colorful characters who have dark sides lurking the music flowed well with the action and also burst shots of the ocean in synch with the acting jennifer coolidge is annoying but she grew on me rare to see an obese actress who is glam but i figured that is to appeal to the overweight american viewers her outfits were gorgeous as were the other actresses looking forward to season three
2,i cant believe the reviews this dress has gotten i ordered it and was so excited to get it when i tried it on all of my excitement was gone while i love the color the quality just isnt there and its not worth the money even with the discount i used the fabric is not thick in fact it is quite sheer for velvet i honestly wouldnt feel comfortable with out a slip on underneath this second is the fit im a xs on top on bottom and i ordered an xs and the way this hung on me w
2,just had to work hard and push through the first episode kept checking the time as i watched it not a particularly good sign probably the dullest group of characters i have ever come across in any tv show despite the eye candy of alexandra daddario and the excellent connie britton this is an absolute chore as with most things each to their own the dialogue is boring predictable and cliched how standards have dropped in recent years
2,sauce is very thick looking for something more creamy
2,i loved this top but the cut was too short in the waist for my frame wish it came in a tall size
2,i ordered a regular size s and it was way too boxy for my body type and shorter than the stated length i dont know if the length stated is from a size m but the small was definitely shorter in the front at least if youre petite with curves like me its not a flattering cut
2,i wish i had read more of the reviewsbut thought i would give it a try the shirt doesnt seem as long as on the model but the armpits are sewn to hit mid shirt this would be ok if it was the length pictured but since it isnt it makes you look very boxy i dont know if i ordered a size too big or if it is just the way the shirt was made wanted to love for fallunfortunately i am taking back
2,i ordered this in a l online and wasnt a fan when i received it the colors are pretty bright but they also look cheap in my opinion it also had an awkward fit because of the material there is no give at all it was really tight on my chest d for reference and it was also pretty short and im short it barely hit the top of my pantsand im back it went
2,i had really high hopes for this shirt after reading the reviews first off it runs really small i usually wear a small or medium or i couldnt even get the on i probably could have even done a the fabric was extremely flimsy i was almost afraid i was going to rip it taking it off other than the sizing and the fabric it just wasnt flattering on me
2,i loved the series because i already love the world of tim burthon and for all the fans of the world of extravagance and the ordinary this is the perfect series for you i find that jenna ortega plays very well the role of wednesday it suits him very well i loved the style of the series which mixes reality and fantasy wednesday is really a series that is very much about the adam family we easily find the two universes whitch are very coherent the plot is quite understood but we take a real pleasure without time out to dive into the gothic world of the heroine to conclude wednesday is a series for teenagers that is very well done if you like the universe of tim burton of the adams family this serires is made for you personally i lovedd it and i cant wait for season
2,i love the color and style of this dress and i wanted to love it too sadly the fabric is truly inferior to the retailer brand and definitely not worth the price of the dress checked it out in store and so glad i did as it would have been returned for sure
2,i wanted to love this sweater the lavender color and design with the pleated back was beautiful however when i put it on it added at least pounds to my frame unfortunately its going back since the cut just doesnt work on my frame
2,feel more like a draggedout movie than a tv show not much character building or perspective taking lack of planning and forethought trying to come across as sophisticated but in reality hollow tropey and lazy get the impression that the story is made up as they go along shame really character setup is often interesting even if they all end up seeming onedimensional i enjoy the music scenic shots and normally the first few episodes before the narrative starts falling apart or massive plot holes pop up more of a hate watch than a satire and hate as in you dont want any character from any walk of life to be able to stick to their values have genuine empathy or grow
2,ordered this in white and the peachy color the armholes were gaping not well designed i dont recommend this tee at all
2,taylor sheridan is an genius and all actors are marvelous in the series from kevin costner till cole hauser i really like both prequel series as well i know taylor sheridanll make a nd season to but in my opinion he should make a sequel season to too i wanna see what happened with james dutton and his family after elsas funeral i know taylor made a short flashblack to james dutton in yellowstone series but i think his character should get a nd season as well one of my big dream to make an holiday in usa and visit the real ranch in montana i wanna see how is the real ranch life and make contact to real cowboys
2,really cute suit but way too small up top not enough coverage under arms and across busti wish retailerpolgie carried bathing suits in the stores so they can be tried on this is the nd suit i have ordered that had to be returned i wont order a bathing suit again as its just to much of a risk
2,not worth of money
2,i quite liked this it was a great adaptation of the first reacher novel the killing floor that remains pretty true to the book from memory alan ritchson made a great jack reacher and the rest of the cast did an admiral job great escapist action stuff bring on series
2,i was so excited to try these but was really disappointed in the fit i found the legs and butt to be tight but the waist to be really big if you are normally a size i wouldnt bother with these
2,netflixs the witcher is simply outstanding dont mind the bad reviews i didnt play the game nor did i read the novel but speaking as a person who has a good grasp and understanding of the show i will tell you that this show is one of a kind at first it will be confusing seeing as they were trying to link up different timelines but in the end you will come to see it is a very beautiful plot and kudos to henry his performance was so crazy the effects are nice the fight scenes are beautiful generally speaking its a great show
2,im c and lbs i ordered the size p and while the color and fabric is pretty the back and front bodice were much to low to wear a bra even if i were to shorten the straps it was also very tight across my ribs despite ordering a petite the hem was much too long i ended up returning it
2,these were so perfect for the first hour or so i was convinced they were my new favorite pants but their initial forgiveness turned into a slovenly stretch and they creased and wrinkled like crazy after id been sitting a couple hours it looked downright embarrassing saggy and wrinkly radiating from the crotch no less i got them in the gray and its possible that other colors use different less awful fabric
2,just started the series and all i can say is amazing the storyline is really brought well and the timeline is clear and justified the only adjustment that needs to be done is the length of the episodes
2,while showing made up decisions in an attempt to make the world actually and truly better the exact opposite happens and the world your trying to portray gets worse there will always be classes there will always be differences with people everyone gets the same opportunity its what everyone does with that opportunity that dictates success or failure
2,this is a great cut and looks good on it is a very poor quality material it balled and frayed in two wears i returned it to the store
2,this shirt is not a good look for a gal with hips the fit at the top is tight i ordered a small but there is so much material at the bottom and if you are a little taller i am it hits at a place that is not flattering i was hoping for something that hung straight down and would be good with leggings this is not italso the material is a little stiffer then i was expecting
2,this is a sweet top as it is shown on the model it appears there is a panel behind the lace on the front of the top this is not sothe entire front of the top is see through one would need to wear a camisole the material on the blouse is very sheerit appears to be rather cheap actually if you are wearing a top this sheer it does not make sense to have a camisole on underneath that said you are going to be able to see your bra and skin down to your belly button if you do not have a camisol
2,the top on the model in the photo is a true ivory but the top in reality is more beige well im blonde with fair skin so im not sure this is going to work it also looks more dressy in the photo than it does in reality i think the ivory color on the model and the pleats only down the front make it look more dressy but in reality with it really being beige having pleats everywhere and being a crinkly fabric it looks more casual i had wanted it to be more dressy to pair with skirts
2,i ordered an xxs and it is extremely short in length another customer had a similar review but i still took a chance that it would fit well the sides of the shirt have slits and because the shirt is too short it shows the skin on my hips the rest of the shirt fit fairly well but ill still need to return this top
2,laptop use after minutes heat laptop very bad product
2,i agree with the other reviewer that the belted part definitely gives some great definition for those with a defined waist and that its a much lovelier color in person but thats about it for me thoughts below _____________ pros tts i ordered the medium for my c frame and found it sufficient the color is much nicer in person as the other reviewer mentioned its a richer brown think mocha latte in terms of color the belt really helps tie it all together and keep it
2,i ordered a small and it is enormous i usually wear a size it is short but the fullness in the body and the sleeves made me look like a sumo wrestler also it is a very heavy knit which would be great for up north but too bulky for atlanta unless the temps are in the s im sending it back
2,i was very excited to receive these pants and wished they had worked out as the fabric is structured and yet comfortable however while stretchy they looked very tight on the thigh and yet were too big in the waist i will acknowledge im a runner with somewhat muscular legs but was hopeful these pants wouldnt cling to them for reference im lbs and usually wear a size in pants
2,i believe that it is about time to include nonamerican characters why not latinos europeans asians but not just among the resort staff resorts are places where you can find people from all around the world besides that the last season was a nice surprise because it had two characters trying to figure out how to manage their dark sides and that made a lot of difference when compared to the first and second seasons the soundtrack is probably the best i have ever seen in a tv show it prepares the audience for the emotions ahead the casting as usual is almost perfect except for the hotel manager of the third season a useless character
2,this top arrived today and after trying it on i wanted to leave a review to say that the shirt is without a doubt pinned back on the model in the product picture the fit is designed to be loose so i dont think anyone could possibly get the same look as the model even if they sized down ive included a picture of how it fits naturally and a picture of how it fits the model as i hold the fabric back its still a cute shirt just not the flattering top i was expecting im debating on
2,why do designers keep making crop tops i cant imagine this would be flattering on anyone especially someone average height and well endowed on top i looked like a football player the pattern and fabric are gorgeous so if you are like tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work i am between a and fit a small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top such a weird cut there is a cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so s
2,i thought that this dress would be perfect for my th birthday however i was disappointed when i received it it is extremely heavy from the beading and i just did not find it pretty in person it did nothing for me also it runs small and was tight
2,ive been a fan of the novels for years now i read all of them and i love jack reacher finally amazon came to the rescue and did a superb job in hiring an actor who is reacher alan ritchson is the perfect jack reacher from the novels this is the first book of the series and nick santora really understood the character and wrote the series being true to the book dont like when some writers feel the need to change the books when adapting to tv ie lucifer game of thrones this show is very entertaining and well done i hope amazon keep doing it until all the books have been adapted for tv great job to all involved and kudos to alan ritchson for a great delivery of jack reacher just sit down and enjoy the series
2,the otter looks cute but is infinitely loud from the motorin addition i find it totally awkward to open the velcro down every time you want to make a different setting song volume light
2,this blouse has a very cute style the ruffles are really nice but why does it have to be so sheer there is no way i could wear this to work without a cami it also felt slightly on the small size almost too tight for my normal size
2,i got this dress in the mail today and really thought i was going to love it the color is a beautiful rich red which was a nice surprise i was expecting more of a dusty red from the picture love the fabric soft and appears to be good quality the length is perfect hit right at my knees size small the flow of the dress is great as well the ultimate flaw would be the arm and neck holes the neck hole was choking me but yet a little loose at the back of the neck almost like it was on
2,i found this piece very boxy and not very feminine i tried to make it work but i just wasnt feeling it the material is thin and the design is boring unfort it wasnt for me

2,keyboard verry cheap quality
2,windows defender not working or cant start
2,i bought these a great alternative to black jeans but they are headed back the texture is nice but lets call them what they are thin leggings not worth the price in my opinion honestly i cant seem to find a pair of pilcros that i like so id spent the extra money on a better pair of black jeans
2,i wanted so much to love this cake the strawberry smell and taste were terrific but the cake with the sugar in the jello and the cake mix was far too sweet the frosting was almost inedible it was so sweet when eaten with the cake we scraped the frosting off and topped each piece with a dollop of greek yogurt and it was delicious but would have been equally so with whipped topping or ice cream if i were to make it again i would probably make it from scratch and reduce the sugar and serve it unfrosted i added some dried strawberries which i had processed a couple of spoonful to enhance the strawberry flavor
2,i made this for st patricks day it is a moist cake but doesnt taste chocolatey at all it tastes like beer the frosting was quite runny so i added additional powdered sugar trying to thicken it up some but it didnt work it stayed runny even after refrigerating it tasted good though i poured it over the cake my husband liked it but he loves beer
2,not great quality runs a bit lose disproportionate too large in neck and arms area
2,this shirt is not near as nice as it may look the fabric is just ok it runs large i ordered a xs and the neck line was huge and gaping not worth the money even on sale
2,this picture does not represent these jeans the color is way off they are more yellow toned and look much more worn than in the picture they also run very small
2,whenever we but these they never contain any white chocolate ones
2,i purchased this sweater in my usual xs but found the silhouette to be way more tentlike than pictured on the model the knit is pretty stiff too so the sweater didnt lay flat but hung on me in kind of a triangle shape also the sweater knit was heavier than i expected from the picture and seemed to be more of a fall weight piece i am fairly small but lately im finding that retailer pieces are huge in an xs and i have to size down to xxs i know im not that tiny maybe this wou
2,battery life is so poor that it last for hrs only when it is brand new then you can think that if it get old thank how much backup it can give
2,this dress is just too baggy overall i am lbs and a size small was so unflattering i cant go down in size because the waist detail will get too high on me it was already a little high on the small
2,i wanted to love this but instead of being a flowy kimono top as pictured it was a thick blazer type garment not at all what is pictured here unfortunately also it was much shorter than pictured and i am only love most retailer styles but this one was a miss and a return
2,too many issues stop charging in one month and also hang too much acer customer service is worst not recommended
2,gorgeous but so big i got eh pxs and its like a mumu i wiill return
2,i purchased this dress for my graduation the colors are much more intense and bright then they appear online im kind of concerned that i look like a carnival tent i like the style but the fabric feels cheap for the cost of the dress the fabric is syntheticthe fit is great the dress is true to size
2,i bought this in the white size m lbs b because i wanted a baggy fit which i got so this is tts the white is more of an offwhite rather than a bright white which i like because i happen to be looking for an offwhite tee and the shape is goodeven in a larger size this tee nips in at the waisthowever the quality of this tee is lacking as it is the typical cheap marled slightly seethrough material that seems to be everywhere these days and the band on the back of th
2,i actually had no problem with the neck hole of this shirt even with the xs size however i had a huge issue with the bottom eyelet section its so tight it stretches across my thighs and looks so funny as the top part is still loose i tried moving up to a size small and still had this problem maybe just not for girls with thighs very strange fit
2,i was initially going to rate this show an mainly due to the fact that whilst it is pretty good theyre a few hit and miss moments for me however after coming onto imdb and seeing how many people gave the show a and called it atrocious ive changed my rating to a its one thing to give your opinion but a completely different thing to review bomb a show for the sake of doing so and no im not being paid by netflix user you know who you are the show whilst it does have its flaws is really good the colors the acting amazing performance from jenna ortega the story and the twists are amazing i sincerely hope they keep up the pace with the nd season and i hope that jenna wins all the awards come next year
2,laptop was strucking
2,cmon the accent is wrong a simple google search would prevent this
2,i ordered the top from a store to have it shipped it is very pretty but once on it fit the wrong way i got a small because i know that this designer tends to run tight across the bust the shoulder was too rounded for this neck line sleeves should have been either longer or sleeveless the empire waist even on a smaller busted woman like myself was cut too high
2,casting is the central problem with this show the new gomez doesnt fit the role at all and the new wednesday simply lacks charm all her scenes feel forced with very poor timing she desperately tries to not blink then does it anyway out of the three wednesdays so far she is by far the worst and the most wooden too i thought wednesdays roomie in this show showed a much better performance of bringing her own character to life music is great danny elfman never disappoints creature design is fresh and creative but the acting is all over the place there is no chemistry between the main characters and thus the whole show feels forced and redundant i could have worked with a more charming cast who knows wont finish because its way too uncharming and lame better luck for beetlejuice
2,i bought of these units yes at amazon sandisk ultra gb microsdhc class uhs memory card mbs with adapter sdsdquagua for samsung galaxy siii and one samsung note and found that one in the sgiii has stopped working i tried everything in a computer in different adapters dead is dead since the other three are used by nontechno people i am not sure if they are still working or notwhen i contacted sandisk they gave me test instructions which of course all failed the tests to return i have to pay for shipping that must be tracked this will cost around for a item i ignored this and shipped with a regular mail i should not expect anything back but who knowsfor more i have another unit and i can tell you it will not be a sandisk ultra oh well the average price for the remaining units will then be more than the purchase priceif i get a replacement i will update this messageupdatei got an email from sandisk to advise me that they did receive the item and it is being processed shipping without tracking cost me vs at least i have to give their customer service or return department credit for being honest too bad the memory cards have problems as sandisk had an excellent name for providing good quality products maybe i should give this another star but there no such thing
2,this is much prettier online than on me too much dress even though i sized down
2,too small too flare nice thick fabric not my favorite pant
2,definitely not a keeper for our house made exactly according to directions and our year old pushed her bowl away saying no thank you yuck the teenager tried two bites and decided on a sandwich and the two adults ate it but said never again will stick to a traditional potato soup
2,im mystified by all of these reviews i made this tonight and it was dry and bland no one liked it at all will not be making it again
2,swear i wish i could just wipe my memory and watch it all over again like seriously the sounds the shots the characters the actors even the freakin intro everything is just chefs kiss ive never seen a show this good its insane so gripping so well done im obsessed seriously season is hands down my fave i freaking love tania season is fire too a bit darker but still so good and season hilarious i love it love it love it i hate greg like i cant stand him which means the character is actually really well done is there gonna be a season i legit cant wait i need it fingers crossed hope they drop it soon
2,i was very disappointed in this recipe i havent eaten it yet but i almost want to toss the whole thing in the trash it looks like a disaster ive never had a problem with recipes not turning out and bake quite often i should have used my better judgement with this frosting and altered it but i wanted to try the recipe just as it was written to see what i thought i wanted to surprise my husband with this cake but im embarrassed to show it to him the frosting is so runny and didnt set up at all it makes the cake look like i just dumped a liquid over the top it looks nothing like the picture dont make the same mistake i did do like many other reviewers and make your own frosting or you will just waste time and ingredients
2,this sweater is very long could be worn as a dress at
2,the top is totally see through and fabric some what itchy it also feels cheap to the touch i love the idea but cant keep it for this priceim a shorty so id have to hem it too sadly will return
2,oled is better than this not mental body only one side is metal
2,i was really disappointed with these pants they were a thinner fabric than expected with little to no stretch they were very tight around my legs and huge at the waist sadly they will be going back
2,cake was not very exciting i had hoped that the guinness would make it unique and interesting but it was really not at all noticeable
2,i wanted to love this was so excited when i ordered it online the fabric blue and white was beautiful but the cut was bad it fit me like a maternity top and made me look like i was months along i have a feeling that the models had theirs pinned back in the back because it does not lay flat like that in front it has a lot of fabric with no place to go but up and out returning
2,and this one proved to be no different the short end of it this dress is pretty much super thick heavy linen with a rope like collar the supposed embroidery you see and there is no lining but completely unnecessary pockets im typically a or depending on the designer a super fit lbs and knew enough to order an xs in this however it still fit like a potato sack even upon taking it out of the plastic bag i knew it was going back between the unrealistic pictures and lack
2,battery is getting hot soon the system runs slow no speed even at gb ram
2,this jacket has cute details i like the front pockets and color it has no shape and is about size bigger than marked i felt like a sack of potatoes in it
2,tried this twice in yellow because for the price it seems like it would be such a useful piece but the quality is below average for an retailer dress its just a shapeless thin beach coverup that i couldve picked up anywhere the yellow color is so cute though if youre looking for a light breezy gotothebeach dress that you can shove in a bag with your towel this might be good for you but its too thin for just about anything else
2,i saw this one for the first time today instore and was not impressed it is a lacey material with an underlayer so with a different cut other than a swing dress i would have fallen in love and it would have been absolutely gorgeous unfortunately i did not like the swing dress cut especially not in white i wasnt sure if the designer was going for a throw back to the s or a shortened version of my grandmothers wedding gown but either way it was not working for me to be fair swing dr
2,have been enthralled with each new episode yes some are better than others but overall im addicted and fighting for janeoffred
2,if you like the writing of jonathan swift and evelyn waugh you will like this show this is not bland cookiecutter tv writing it is insightful funny and accepting of peoples foibles while poking fun at them i love it
2,this is a beautiful dress the quality is excellent the layers and the embroidery are beautiful however it just didnt look right on me it looked like a maternity dress i am very petite short with a big bust and it just did nothing for me i think this style would look best on a tall woman with a smaller bust unfortunately i will be returning this dress
2,the idea of this shirt is awesome it just needs to be made longer and not so boxy the ruffle is darling i would be so happy if the the designer made some modifications i think a lot of people would buy it then
2,i was definitely wearing retailer colored glasses my term for when something looks great on you in the dressing room but leaves you wondering whatwasithinking when you try it on later when i bought this once i tried this on at home i basically felt like i was swallowed up by this thing theres so much fabric layered in front and around your shoulders that you can actually feel the weight hanging down around your neck and it naturally sticks out rather far in the back i wanted to love t
2,i was really looking forward to this dress i tried it on and it does not wow like the picture it came wrinkled but i think even pressed it would fall weird the side swoop falls funny and you can see the seams underneath and the top front falls funny not quite sure what to do with it it almost looks like a mock turtleneck until you fold it down again maybe if you get it pressed that would be better the back is still beautiful though im lbs ordered a maybe on someone talle
2,the flavor combination wasnt our favorite
2,very good
2,this is the second time ive tried to make this cake and it just falls apart this time i put it in for almost mins longer and still completely fell apart it tastes great ill give it that my mil swears by this cake but im starting to wonder if she actually makes another one its really frustrating bc now im cakeless for my sons birthday after the same for fathers day i bake and decorate cakes as a hobby but have never had this experience before maybe cutting the coffee or another liquid in half would work better or a higher temp idk either way i probably wont be trying again with this recipe
2,okay i was hooked from the first season every season is a masterpiece and the finales are just great the character developments and arcs are fucing amazing a single episode has the power to make you cry then rage bring excitement and then leave you confused definitely suggest you to watch it
2,this series is such chaos but chaos in the most human way im really amazed of it because i didnt expect much they did such a good job to keep it interesting i was curious the whole time its really fun and chill series it shows a bunch of peoples messed up lives and everything become a mess because of one person choses we are all connected its really important the pilot episode to start interesting and they did a perfect job the beginning is important because thats the first impression and you need to keep the auditory to watch the show and thats not it you need to continue to keep it interesting and that series has all of it
2,this oversized sweater is lightweight and scratchy i knew it would fit big but the neck is overly bulky the color is a bright blue as depicted in the picture fits a little larger on me than on the model im petite so it overwhelmed me
2,not sure what everyone was so impressed with i made these and they were really dry maybe i just didnt add enough zucchini but still i had to smother my cupcake in creamcheese frosting to eat it to be fair i did not try the caramel frosting
2,i was struggling with the options above does it fit true to size or is it too small or too large it is both too small and too large which is really strange the model makes this shirt look stunning but the product is actually very boxy i am weigh lbs and i typically order anywhere from a prxxsxs i ordered this shirt in an xsp and the shirt sleeves were short and the middle was boxy quite frankly it looked like a maternity shirt and the structure was not worth the money
2,it is such a cute design and very soft and comfortable but the picture for this product is very deceiving it looks like the sweater is fairly long in the pictured product page but it is considerably short i am nearly six foot tall but thought by this picture it would be lengthy not at all it is a beautiful sweater might work better for a shorter stature
2,i have watched three episodes and doubt that i will watch the remining ones i realized the show was mainly about wednesday but not all about wednesday the one little short scene with the rest of the family was fun and gave me the idea the whole family would be involved the character of wednesday is sullen to the point it is hard to like her or even be interested in her and certainly not entertained the story has gotten boring without much of a plot to it i may try to watch some more of it later but i sort of doubt it it is hard to make a review that requires so many required characters
2,over heating
2,about time we had a star wars that tickled my fancy season had multiple moments of drag and side quests but found myself air punching regardless
2,this top is exactly what i was hoping for except it is missing the drawstring so disappointing mailing it back
2,well the model looks great and i really like interesting unusual designs as it can be really unique for very long time i tried and when i opened package it was funny looking tent with several beautiful buttons fits like tent long huge make me look like i am on military trials and i supposed to be some sort of target
2,i ordered a small and the top part was huge yet the bottom a little snug you need a big chest and small legs and bottom too bad its very cute
2,the first season was undeniably phenomenal one of the best series ive seen in a long while the characters were developed well the storyline was amazing and the drama spectacular based on season one alone i rated the series as a overall therefore imagine my surprise when upon viewingcompleting the second season the overall quality of the series took and unobstructed nose dive off a cliff what happened it couldnt be the death of joel alone as he was still used in flashbacks my biggest gripe is the dumbing down of ellie she went from an intelligent and cunning character to a ignorant annoying little girl in constant need of rescue this series could have been great but evidently the creators settles for decent with season at a rating of and season two a rating of combined the series gets a generous
2,after three episodes i give up i cannot believe this is a series with emmy nominations actors are ok but not outstanding and no real laugh in more than hours enough pathetic
2,camera is not upto mark
2,honestly everyone should watch this show to get a picture of what life could be like under a crazy religious cult
2,in itself the toy is very good however after a month it started to spin sometimes it goes out after seconds sometimes the sounds change by themselvesging back too bad
2,i really wanted to like this top but unfortunately it was short and the sleeves were just too puffy it did not look flattering and will be going back
2,please keep this show runningi and many people need reacher in our life one of the best show i have seen and trust me i have seen many shows firstly when i heard reacher was being re made into show i was not fully convinced but i had confidence that alan will be perfect for this role and they have not disappointed me since please do all the books remake i am so happy that alan finally making his name in the industry i think he is a great actor he has a lot of range as an actor and his height and body are just perfect for reacher lee childs book are just great and show is just perfect depiction of his book we need to do all his book again please keep on continuing the showthank you
2,it was quite a bit shorter on me than what it shows on the model who is the same height the pullon styling is a fail as i could barely get my head through the neck opening i was afraid it might rip a seam the fabric seems low quality like it would stretch out and degrade faster than others overall not the dress or quality i expected
2,i ordered this online and when i opened the package i was impressed with the quality of the material and stitching for this top it is much nicer than a basic tshirt when i tried this on the band of stitching that was supposed to go beneath my chest was sitting on top of my cleavage also the overall length is listed as long but i think that is the back of the shirt the front of the shirt is very short on me im hitting well above my hip bones if only this was much m
2,this sweater i bought to go with a navy dress it is not ivory it is sortof a blush color not at all what i had in mind the sweater itself is pretty the back is shorter as someone else described which looks slightly awkward when wearing it definite return
2,i noticed this top on one of the sales associates and it looked great shes probably lbs and about tried it on and it looked horrible i even tried sizing down twice im and the ruffles started right under my chest i gave stars bc of the material it is light and summery
2,this product is not good
2,i got this dress and the material was super fuzzy and itchy the prior reviews stated it was warm and cozy and not itchy at all but i found it to be uncomfortably so the dress was true to size for me and the length was good i loved the plaid in the material just wished the material had been more soft and not rough the material reminded me of mohair
2,i ordered these in m lbs and they are tts they fit well and are neither tight nor loose the issue that i have with them and the reason that i sent them back is that the material although comfortable is completely transparent if i were to try to run out to get the mail in these the whole neighborhood would essentially see me bottomless furthermore these are not white but offwhite and quite a yellowy offwhite at that so these loungers dont look as cute with the feature
2,if i was a wildeyed enthusiast and was asked to rate free magnums as part of a promotion id perhaps err on the generous side as a paying customer however these are nothing to write home about theres an uncomfortable flavour clash between the dark chocolate coating and the sickly sweet raspberry sauce which covers the core thats difficult to describe the core itself reminded me of the cheapest imaginable insipid own brand raspberry icecream with little of the smooth creaminess you find in other magnums its almost as if they rushed the product development process and ended up with bitter raspberry ripple on a stick so so disappointing when you consider what these could have been
2,i was disappointed with these the size seemed small the ice cream was a funny texture just melted in the mouth with no substance or flavour the cone was delicious and crispy although no chocolate in the bottom like the original cornettos i wont be buying these again i prefer the new vegan magnum
2,these look much cuter in the picture than in person i found them to be very thin and cheap looking i am pretty sure you could find a similar pair at a budget department store
2,not an awesome laptop a budget laptop with very very cheap build quality the processor and the ram capacity are the only pros of this laptop the cons are an extensive list the keyboard looks very cheap we cant use this for regular use we have to buy an additional keyboard and mouse combo the mouse trackpad is also very cheap overall build quality is very average the display is also not bright enough usable only in indoor conditions even in a small amount of sunlight we read more
2,was going to order this top in orange but could not decide what size i am either a large or xl i found that the top was in stock in a local retailer in white and went to try it for size first the top is huge i tried the large on and it fit me across the bust and shoulders nicely the rest of the top was like a large tent the white is an off white and really is not attractive looking in fact in the store it was displayed with a jacket over it online the orange looks completely different
2,this top was too big for me lbs and ordered xxs fit was fine and wanted it too work but too overwhelming on me as well will be going back
2,battery backup is very low
2,this top has a nice design i love the lace up back which makes it much more adjustable in shape if you lace it lower it is more flattering to your waist however the fabric quality is very poor on the white tank it arrived with a small tear in the front hem area which i could have easily fixed it is very sheer even with a nude bra my bra was too visible for my comfort plan on wearing a full camisole underneath tank or bralette you are fine with being on display
2,my cake didnt rise isnt baking soda needed for helping to rise i didnt see that in the receipe
2,bad probackt
2,i own many retailer dresses but the sizing can be odd i usually wear a size and i have a floreat maxi dress size that works well i am c and based on the reviews i decided to order a size the dress fits well except for he bust area that is very snugcouldnt even get the zipper up i will probably have to order a size to be able to close the zipper on the bust area but it will be huge everywhere elsethe fabric seems very delicate and may develop runs easily its a shame because th
2,i purchased this shirt in blue hoping it would be a basic addon to my wardrobe its been about a month and i have since washed and worn it twice the color is now fading and i found a hole in the front of the shirt im not sure if its the fine fabric that caused it to tear but i washed it on gentle cycle and didnt do anything that would have warranted a tear sadly this did not serve up to its purpose i wouldnt suggest paying the price tag or even sale price for an item that i dont expec
2,i ordered this in size xl and ended up returning it as soon as i received it the color was just as pretty in person the thick eyelet panel was well done the problem is the whole tank was much smallertighter than pictured i have several tops from this maker and was surprised how this was cut too small compared to their normal fit im pearshaped so the hip area looked terrible but the whole top just wasnt up to the typical fitting standards for xl retailer has done much better in the pas
2,plot its a story set in between two world wars about a man who rises above all his obstacles to form a powerful gangster family in england acting the cast overall has a unit brings out the best in them with standout performance from cillian murphy thomas shelby cant believe he has not received a emmy for this role cinematography visuals are a piece of artwork with stunning backgrounds that capture old age england slowmotion shoots are a thing to watch character development the show comes second best to breaking bad in terms of character development which is a great feat by itself the characters of the shelby family grow beyond hardships to narrate us a gripping story along with the main character music all the above mentioned points are taken to new heights by the background scores theme music red right hand sets you up to the tone of the show
2,on the hanger i thought this had a chance but oh geez puffy sleeves itchy metallic thread lace what a mess and thin and uncomfortable no no no
2,i ordered this in my usual size small b bust around lbs but the seam around the high waist stuck out and didnt cinch in at the waist at all rather bubbled out a bit the tunic flaps laid strangely as well like they were too small almost the high cut sides were indeed high cutshowing the waistband of my leggings apparently that is a new style as i have seen a few other tops like it around but i question whether slits that high are appropriate for actual wear outside on
2,my wife and i refer to this show as big man punch chances are that if he runs into an issue his resolution will be to punch someone its a recurrent panaceadeus ex machina for all of jack reachers woes overall its an entertaining show with moderate depth that is worth the watch alan ritchson comes across as really dry and curt but it strangely works for the character throughout the seasons there are a nice cast of supporting characters decent plotlines and twists and one overdone boston accent i recommend the show but wouldnt expect it to knock your socks off just sit back and enjoy
2,this dress hit my waist in a weird spot and was too short i would not have felt comfortable bending over it was a tad too full which wasnt flattering either i really wanted to love it bc they design is adorable i need to return it
2,this is huge i understand thats the style but it looked like i was wearing my husbands size xxl i tried to imagine a really cold day when all that extra fabric would be nice but then it started to itch and itch and itch
2,much lower quality than other robes i have purchased
2,i love the ethnic colors the creative woven design of this garment thats what attracted me in the first place however some of the metallic threads had snagged i thought the loose weave acrylic yarns would lead to more snags it would eventually stretch out of shape also its very big too bad it doesnt come smaller in the online picture it must have been gathered clipped behind the model because it really doesnt fit close like that the long armholes are not visible online as
2,i ordered this dress in the blood orange and have a few complaints while it appears to be made with quality it runs really large also in the picture the fabric appears to have a sheen and be somewhat dressy the actual fabric is just flat cotton its a very casual dress not as dressy as pictured its also quite shapeless on im returning it
2,i really fell in love with this shirt i am about and pounds i ordered xxs which that was a good size from the chest but this shirt is literally so wide i was ready to fly although the model wears this shirt really nicely i think this shirt is made for a certain type of body not quite sure what that is also this shirt is shorter than what i expected it looks a lot longer on the model i had to return this shirt
2,the color is as pictured good quality its lined the zipper in the back makes it look updated i ordered my usual size small petite size it fit perfectly im feet and lbs hourglass figure i had high hopes i have hips and short heavy legs the skirt only emphasized my flaws if youve got great legs you will do well with this i do own other short skirts but the fact that is less tailored in look makes it better suited for a younger gal if youre on the fence give it a try it
2,the reason for the title above is this skirt doesnt wow me i felt like i could find this anywhere and i dont go to retailer for such things they have definitely mainstreamed more and more over the years __________ pros tts i tried on a large and im normally either a or and it fit well and hung well on my hourglass and wider hips without billowing out flows nicely it does have a great movement to it a good everyday skirt not sheer at all it is lined when y
2,how is mandalorian not the focus in his own show season and season were pretty good that focused on the journey and relationship between mandalorian and grogu however season seems to completely erase whatever happened in season and and decided to focus on bokatan why her character is nowhere interesting and her character doesnt seem to develop at all and show goes on to sideline mando and grogu that was the selling point for the entire show moreover what was the episode with lizzo she seemed out of place and the entire episode seemed like an snl skit come on disney dont ruin the only good show in the starwars universe
2,i wish this dress was more fitted the dress looks more fitted and more vibrant in the picture i bought this dress in an xs but i am not sure that going smaller would take care of the amount of material in this dress it was shapeless and did not fall as nicely as it appears i think someone with a fuller figure would look very nice in this dress sad to say that it is going back
2,loved the design but jacket looked like years old because of a lot of piling even brand new jacket at store i wish they use better quality fabric so i would have purchased it
2,dont buy this product the product design is good battery performance is very poor ms office is also not provided keep an eye on that while purchasing functioning is quite good
2,i never leave reviews for anything but this dress was such a complete miss first off its about sizes too big second off its knitted with a metallic thread that you cant really notice in the picture im usually a medium and feel an xs would be sufficient
2,i think this will work well on very busty hourglass figuresor very petite frames but on my athletic build this shirt did me no favors i have one of those body types where my biceps are very muscular and my shoulders are broader than my hips wa b chest i typically take a m or a l in most retailer tops and had i kept this i would have gone with the m this shirt hit my arm at the low point of my bicep above my elbow and made my arms look huge fyi the v neck is very de
2,this was good but it was way overhyped because it was made to be so good but its not all that the dance scene went viral but i think its just weird i also think that it was not really well written and was kinda obvious from the start some of the scenes were unessacary and they left a lot of small questions unanswered i thought it was cool how the camera was angled and it had good directing so it may be worth watching id you want to see a more goth scary show you dont need to watch this because its really not like that some of the stuff is just stupid but you may want to watch it if you like mysteries
2,i am short and curvy and this shirt swallowed me sleeves were especially long
2,everything about this production is high end except the inane silliness of the script and writing i think this simple childish story telling most americans want maybe the target audience here is kids the humor is pretty lame rather goofy but okay the tv show was too something just too dumbed down about it though but if you want something mindless and on autopilot with the occasional scare for a twist then heres your cup of tea it has no charm and makes me appreciate the original cast of zthe addams family much more obviously my opinion is in the minority so i guess it depends what youre looking for
2,im a rather small person about lbs a bust i typically take a ppxxs knowing how retailers sizing is a bit all over the place i ordered this tee in both xxs and xs planning to return the size that was less preferred imagine my surprise when i try on one of the tees and i barely can get it on imagine my further surprise when i realize that the xs is the tee that was so clingy now i realize that this is supposed to be a bodyskimming tee but even as petite as i am i coul
2,was super excited to try this on but had to go up sizes from my normal and the waist was still too tight i was swimming in the top as well just a very strange cut and unflattering such a bummer because its so pretty
2,the acting the photography the direction the editing the soundtrack i am currently rewatching the series and on a second look i am truly astounded at the quality of this show this time i noticed the quality of the set pieces the atmospheric photography mixed with the frenetic camera work when required the subtle way they capture the excellent actors faces and actions this is an extraordinary piece of work i am not sure how much credit the series was given i believe it only won one bafta if you have watched the series do yourself a favor make the time savor each episode you will not refer the time spent
2,yes yes yes what a masterpiece the work in the details the story what a beautiful staircase of ideas so grounded tormented hopeful beautiful it goes to show that you need powerful ideas and elaborated methods of delivery because everything makes sense these are smart and creative people who enjoy telling this story you can see it miles away rises above the hollywood mediocrity and detaches in a new class one that i thought we lost forever one that roots in history and human dimension i could watch this universe forever because is atemporal and is directly connected with humanitys struggle to evolve understand control create destroy live and die i hope this and rogue one will inspire future productions to be skewed towards quality and meaning and finally break the idiocracy of past decade in cinematography and pretty much everywhere else i hope they will let this crew tell the story to the end of the series and not be butchered like others see westworld and the disastrous season
2,battery never charged above i have charges the laptop for hours in a day but battery not charged above and the same is discharged within an hour so i think that the laptop is not good for me
2,this top is huge im typically a size or i bought the and its huge its wider than it is long even if i sized down to a it would still be too much fabric im so disappointed beautiful color and fabric but theres so much fabric i love a flowy top but this one is way too much i will be returning this top
2,i like my dresses oversized but this one is ridiculous its seriously unflattering i usually between a m a l and i got a small and its still massive but the slip is tiny it looks so cute in the picture but not good in person
2,the black band seemed to cut across the widest part of my hips emphasizing them the pants are sheer the fabric was not comfortable against my skin overall the pants were a miss
2,these pants are the perfect color and i love the detail of the zippered pockets i was so excited when they came in the mail and fit pretty well they were slightly loose but i thought they would hold their shape and the size smaller would be too small after an hour of wear i was swimming in these i can almost pull them down without unzipping them and the seat of the pants looks particularly um saggy i am inbetween a and and since the pants are detailed as slim fit i thought it
2,st episode half of the time poor script directing acting with unnecessary nonsense such as queens exercises with sword at battlefield why why would a ruler get itself into a mess instead of managing its troops motivation you say ok does queen has no generals someone who spend one half of their life in battles and other half honing sword fighting skills big musculed figures who can efficiently wield that really heavy pointy thing suppose calanthe mastered sword fight at acceptable level for any reason but she didnt have this bodytype and as i understand good ruler would have way too many problems to deal with to lose time trying to double bodystrength this is not onetoone not a duel this is sword fight at battlefield you need muscles carl next i can accept different skin color in the same race even its confusing but spears in hands of dryads practicly allways why next what have they made with geralt he casts admonitory glances he sighes he fishes geenies at lake with toy net why oh why for right now episode i like the other half of acting not script renfri calanthe eist poor eist they butchered his character mousesack yes geralt is strong a joyforeye sexy with practicly right voice he moves reeeally awesome during the bout yet too sentimental too exposed too common episodes ah nope cavill just pushes too hard and th episode is total wtf and wheres your logic yennefer funny shes better than i expected after trailer younger than she should be so too much youthful arrogance instead of adult mages overconfidence know what i like this yenn her plotline is insult still actress did good job triss had not much screen time yet she speaks and acts lively shes willful and canny ciri is definitely not shes almost not existing wouldve made good witcher thats not right and jaskier finally this is out of toss a coin to your witcher nnnnice probably if i didnt read the books wouldve watch the series anyway when nothing else is on screen if only remembered idea from one old scifi story time isnt existing everything happening at the same moment our perception creates timeline blah blah etc th episode left me disapointed you know that feeling something wonderful awaits right behind the coner mghm it wasnt there seeme even didnt plan to be there
2,disappointing back is yellowish and looks strange the front view is cute but doesnt match the fabric on the back at all cant imagine why you would do that
2,everyone is talking about ortega wednesday adams and tim burton and sure they deserve a lot of the credit but the truth is the script is really wellwritten and the lines and storyline unravel flawless its pure entertainment but dont let that stop you the bleak view of wednesday is just the perfect cynical voice of seeing right through the superficiality and advertisement of mediocre experiences i loved her lines i also greatly appreciated her delivery quite perfect for such a young actress hands down to her all the actors here played their part so well including gwendoline christie principal weems who has shown her true colors recently in another big part as lucifer in the sandman love her talent tim burton strikes again but i didnt expect anything less from him this is truly right up his alley and he makes the most of it what i noticed is that he kept his unique style while also laying down fresh small directing details that are very much in right now he combines the old and familiar with the new in a way thats exciting and completely absorbing i liked that even if its probably targeted at the younger generations its still a fun watch for adults as well it kept me on my toes from start to finish couldnt stop watching it no unnecessary additions just to keep with the times plain and simple morbid quirks in a fun engaging atmosphere of contrasting characters and mysterious plots i gave this an because of the level of depth but for a program of this type its as good as it gets give it one episode and youll be hooked
2,this show is garbage people who like this crap are so weird we kept waiting for some sort of plot point that would move the story along but nope its just a show about petty problems odd people drunks and drug addicts terrible relationships immature mean girls its not funny enough to be a comedy theres not enough drama to move you emotionally its just a weird snapshot of dumb rich people at a hotel and now i have to fill this review with more characters because imbd is also dumb and wont allow people to give short concise reviews only bloated wordy paragraphs almost there
2,i cooked the sugar and milk minutes and it was too dry after cooling the taste was ok
2,this is a nice shirt but i cant keep it i ordered a and i do have an athletic build with somewhat wider shoulders given how petite i am usually wear petite in all pants and i think this size was perfect fit across the back perfectly when you lift your arms the way it is cut makes it really tight across the chest and shows your stomach at the same time the high low styling makes for a really strange shirttail in the back im sure this is the trend but it really does not look cute
2,i love the fit of these pants theyre the perfect slim black pants however i wore these pants exactly three times before the seams split the middle of the pant in not just one but multiple places disappointed by the workmanshipquality of the product especially since the pants fit amazingly and dont sag like other slim fitting black pants tend to do i hope retailer will take this into consideration and improve the quality of future iterations of this product
2,heating problem
2,not impressed wont make this again
2,good reason to read reviews i concur with others in that it fins large and looks boxy heavy fabric makes matters worse
2,worst build qualityhinge problem and touch pad problem
2,i ordered a medium in this and it definitely fits more like a large i liked the color the sleeves but tying the tie at the neck looks silly on me and leaving it open shows too much cleavage overall it is just shapeless and too much fabric on me im sending this one back
2,the wash on these jeans made my hips look twice as big that in combination with the looser boyfriend cut was not flattering quality was excellent denim was thick with the right amount of stretch unfortunately they had to go back
2,average and not as good as loreal but half the price so ok but thats all nothing special like some seem to think
2,really disappointed at how far removed from the tone of the addams family this adaptation is far too mean spirited and plain dull at times where the early s movies had the right mix of the warmth and tongueincheek macabre humor and fit nicely with the original charles adams cartoons and s sitcom this series is less adams family oriented and more of an uninspired run of the mill mix of rehashed elements from a certain other movie franchise and a couple of other recent popular tv shows the production values are very good and jenna ortega looks terrific but in a schedule filled with somber and depressing shows this is simply yet another one that can be added to the list
2,this tunic is a perfect length for leggings the mauve color got rave reviews on my first wearing and the mixed media and asymmetrical styling gave the garment a unique appeal and made it quite flattering however when i wore it a second time i noticed two micro holes in the sleeve one near my wrist and the other at the shoulder since i take extreme care when laundering my clothes it seems this will have to be a return as the jersey knit is not strong enough to hold up in the delicate cycl
2,i dont agree with the majority of these reviews i followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding extra onions and an additional cup of sharp cheddar cheese on topneither of which should detract from the flavor quite the opposite in fact i found it rather bland and neither of my two men asked for seconds right now my husband is eating a peanut butter amp jelly sandwich instead my son described it as ok for me its not to be repeated hope i can get someone to eat the leftovers
2,i love the color patterns and fabric it has full lining my biggest problem with the dress is the swing style makes it more like a maternity dress and so unflattering a straight shift style would have been much better dress runs large however the armshoulder area is tight
2,the sound machine and the breathing of the otter was great and would help my son fall asleep it worked for about a week and then when you pushed the button it would make a noise for a couple seconds then stop agree with other reviews that sometimes the breathing mode would make a loud sound but it wasnt consistent unfortunately it seems this toy is not reliable in performing as described so hard to recommend this to anyone especially at its price point
2,someone had mentioned this is a show of nothing about nothing and i think thats the best and only possible way to explain it its not only excruciatingly boring its also extremely slow with no plot or theme or motif and even if there was one ur doesnt show to the last five minutes of the show i never give bad reviews and always try and finish a show before commenting on it but my brain was literally wilting trying to continue it it took me a month just to get through and stream episodes cause i just kept getting more and more bored and tired of the show i sincerely dont get wheres the hype in the show
2,i was expecting a nice golden yellow color but what i received was very dull in color with greenish undertones very disappointed will be returning
2,i was very surprised to see such dark blue sequence on this dress it did not appear as it did on the photo i was pretty disappointed by the color the photo of the dress is much more impressive
2,this top is absolutely beautiful the fabric is great the cut is nice etc however the buttons are too big for the button loops which do not have any stretch it took ten minutes to open the shirt to try it on once i had it on i left it unbuttoned i returned it if you cant live without it you could put smaller buttons on it too pricey for a nonfunctioning top too bad
2,ultimately in season two of white lotus was extremely disappointing they had fashioned these characters to where we actually cared about them and then had them do awful and disappointing things acrosstheboard the message of the stories generally were about relationships are at their base just mutual using situations where sometimes one prevails well over the other and other times relationships are about settling for what you can get the decisions that the characters make are seen through the visor of who is being naïve and who is taking care of that nativity in the end all of the characters suffer that have a naïve trait and those who are seeking to settle or take advantage of that nativity are shown to triumph across all of the relationships depicted in the show all of the scenes are well acted and the cast does a great job with the plot line they are given at one time or another all of the characters elicit a visceral reaction to their poor behavior poor decisions and sometimes lack of action until its too late as a viewer at the end of the episodes one is left with a feeling of heavy disappointment in the decisions that are made and the empty relationships all of the characters are left with one thing of note is the photography of the spectacular locations sicily and other parts used in the filming come off extremely well one will be tempted to immediately purchase a ticket to palermo or to other parts of sicily to enjoy the combination of ancient architecture and rolling beautiful countryside while mount etna rumbles above it all this well active drama leaves a thudding emptiness in the viewer like the unsatisfying relationships each of the characters is left with as they settle for what they can get or what they can tolerate this is a great result because it had to be the aim of the writers producers and actors and they deliver
2,i think that this product by itself is a great product however not all devices is built for microsd xc and not all devices like pad and phone that specifically states that it features microsd with compatability to microsd xc this happened to me since i just bought a new pad i thought that it would be compatible however it did not the microsd xc is formatted with exfat so my device can detect the hardware but it cant write or read from it
2,i found this dress to be very short waisted much closer to an empire waist than shown in the picture it was also an inch or two longer in the skirt than other maxi dresses ive gotten from retailer it really could have used those inches above the waist just a strange fit overall
2,what a disappointment this dish was i love potatoes and could not wait to try this too much sour cream and cheese for our tastes wish i had only made half the recipe to try it you cant even taste the potatoes that well made as directed except for the green onions omitted them wont be making this one again
2,super easy cake to make but the frosting was too runny to create froth enjoyed the cake very much the first day but really dried out in the fridge overnight and i had it wrapped in plastic wrap disappointing overall
2,this is a pretty dress but the cut is quite boxy i had thought that the dress would cut in a bit along the body and then flare out more around the waist down to the hem however the dress is baggy from the sleeves all the way down which lends to a rather unflattering look
2,super cute dress but the waist band is very large and bulky
2,work is very slow
2,the quality and fabric are fabulous but its just too voluminous for my figure lbs would look great on someone more slender
2,i bought this outfit online on sale so i only paid but i think if i saw it in person first i probably wouldnt have purchased it while the design is cute the fabric is beyond cheap its not just polyester its like a plastic polyester i think if you dress it up with high heels necklace armful of bangles you can probably distract from the fabric lb purchased xs and its a little big still
2,wow what a quality series this is a serious star wars when someone dies there is weight to it decisions have consequences and this show portrays that well the strongest element of this series is the use of the empire small time guys who are loyal to the cause on one hand you root against the empire because they are authoritarian elitist but on the other hand when their men die the officers take that to heart and so it humanizes them the dynamic is important in making the villain more than just a one dimensional marvel villain with the exception of thanos the cast is excellent especially the empire characters kyle soller doesnt waste any screen time yes its a slow burn and i realize that annoys people but i am an adult and enjoy a show that builds upon itself rather than using as many tropes as possible to keep you excited
2,i was really excited about this dress i had only seen it online and it looked like the perfect transitional piece casual or dress up when it arrived in the mail the feel of the fabric was great and i slipped it on and it was so comfy i felt like i was wearing a nightdress unfortunately it hung like that too the material sags in places it shouldnt i have a lb frame and i ordered an extra small and both my husband and sister said it was unflattering and urged me to send it back
2,the shape is awkward too loose not flattering my body just disappears under all the fabric and the bird print wasnt as cute as online returning this one
2,just recently purchased and think its ok for the price would never pay full on this one thats from an retailer shopper whos purchased plenty at full price design is cute but definitely looks like a sleep shirt esp in the lighter color soso on construction the bottom seams pucker slightly the pockets bunch up weirdly steaminglaundering dont help the shoulders also hunch up oddly could be because of the thicker fabric sewn to the knit but laundering didnt help that issue either
2,these run small i am and got a size they were a tad tight on top the waist fit but felt a little too snug short from waist to crotch and then bloomed out in a nice but stiff ish material they are a dark blue animal print i felt like bozo the clown goes to the jungle they looked so silly i had to laugh even with the off these are going back not even comfortable to lounge around the house in never mind being seen by anyone in person
2,i was so excited to get this classiclooking retailer dress i love the ladylike shape and whimsical print the popsicle print on this dress is really truly adorable unfortunately the dress is cut really weird and it made me feel like screaming i bought a size two and it was snug and gaping at the chest and im only a b ladies so be warned at the same time the arm holes were huge i mean massively big i think if you have a swimmers body this might work otherwise youll for sure nee
2,the fit of the top is true to size but i really dont like the taupe terryclothlike sweatshirt under the white lace the white lace is bright white and seems very sturdy but it makes the sweatshirt underneath look very dirty and very noticeably taupe it is terrible paired together i also didnt like the feel of the terryclothlike fabric against my skin even though this is a good quality piece with a lot of interesting detail im absolutely sending it back
2,i have several maeve dresses that fit really well this was not the case with this dress fabric and color are great fit was off especially in top worst part was zipper that wouldnt move smoothly took me a good minutes to get it unzipped such a bummer
2,this crust has no baking powder or baking soda and it results in being very flat there are better recipes than this one
2,dont use granny smith apples pie came out perfectly except grannys make it sour
2,sometimes i order things online that i can hardly wait to arrive and then once they do i wonder if i made a mistake when ordering it this is one of those times and it was not my mistake the shirt i received is not like this one it is an xs but it is quite large falling inches below where this one hits on the model everyone i have shown the shirt to says that it is a denim blue color not grey at all it is a pretty color but not what i thought i was ordering i hate it when this happens
2,very slow start lots of cringe the girls claim to be sophomores in what high school why does every show feel the need to have twentysomething actors play teenagers rather silly let a year old actor play a year old character for once
2,online this looks like a great sweater i ordered an xxsp and found that this sweater is much wider in the middle than pictured in fact im pretty sure they pinned the shirt in the back for the picture to make it appear slimmer unfortunately this sweater will not work for me as i am an hourglass shape and this shirt makes me look pounds heavier
2,i loved this dress before putting it on but it was just not the right cut or style for my body type it is very roomy and full and looked like a maternity dress which was not a look i was going for sadly this will be going back i loved the print and the feel of the material just not a flattering cut for me
2,i usually wear a and ordered two other skirts at the same time the other skirts fit perfectly and this one was more like a size very disappointed for i really liked the idea of it
2,selfishness abound in the selfcentered lives of the people of white lotus all the characters are distasteful yet they are also lovable because they are us its dark funny crude and totally bingeable
2,first of all warrenty was given year this but when i purchase it its shows month only screen size is too small battery backup is hour over heating issue after use hour over all not a good product at all
2,this top is too boxy and has too much going on it should have no buttons or different ones
2,display is not better and poor quality
2,dramasuspenseclasshistoryperformance class one of the best theme song red right hand cillian murphy aka thomas shelby and the entire cast thank you a master piece
2,i didnt receive a jacket i received a very expensive cardigan sweater with no structural qualities to it jackets have some structure to them for example they might nip in at the waist a bit this cardigan doesnt do that it hangs in a very boxy shape the quality is great very light weight and i really love the little pockets and details but i dont needwant another cardigan im lbs and got a small the small seemed big but i think it would have fit fine if it had more st
2,this top is very beautiful and the color is a dream but wow is it short im and it barely hit the top of the waistband on my jeans the fabric is oddly heavy and not light and airy like i expected it seemed like an odd choice for a blouse because of the seaming and gathered fabric at the top of this shirt i wouldnt recommend this to women who are bustycurvy on top it made my chest look huge this styling may work for petite ladies but tall curvy ladies beware
2,this dessert is definitely simple but it tastes exactly like what it is just yogurt and coolwhip sweetened with jello mix
2,get the intel version of loq amd version is more laggy or sort of no performance in it lakes or loads more of the time
2,on my screen this looked like burnt oranges were mixed with pink but this was all pink very washed put pinks looked awful on me as brunette maybe will work for someone who likes pastels overall style was also disappointing just hung this went back
2,this sweater is a cute design but did not work for me i am and this is way to shortcropped and looks awkward the quality was so so it looked stretched out in the front its getting returned
2,i am a dd and lbs and this top was way too baggy it looked awful this is shapeless and oversized i would size down or just pass
2,bought this chromebook just for online teaching but the performance is too bad and lags everywhere
2,after trying several sizes including petite and regular i am sad to return this dress the regular sizes were too long on me i am and although the petite fit me just a little short the biggest issue was how tent like it fit me i wanted it to look like it does on the model but i just couldnt get the fit usually i have great luck with cloth stone
2,first off this runs very large im normally an and sized down to the but probably could have done a it looked like a tent on me the top part is lovely i just think the bottom is way to large and not flattering this one is definitely going back especially with all the white dress options they have out now
2,i didnt realize that there were sequins on the design they kept poking my shoulders and made the top very uncomfortable the white material was also not very flattering on me it went back
2,waste of money display is very very bad
2,the length in the front is too short and the bottom flares a lot which is really unflattering i love the top half of the shirt but the bottom half should be more form fitting
2,seriously that is a hell of a lot of animal feed i wish people would listen to me more about animal feed i mean why that much animal feed is beyond me seriously though this jack reacher is a good time and there is a ton of animal feed in the show
2,this is more of a sleep shirt the fabric is too thin and see through a camisole would not look good under it will be returning it
2,i wanted to like this dress but it just did not work for a bustier frame the fabric is quite loose does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy so if you are wellendowed your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs as a result the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips as on the model and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward on smaller curves this would likely be very flattering but
2,the button to activate this is on the otters tummy and very sensitive so if my upset baby activates it it turns itself off immediately at the first breath it takes because the tummy expands and presses the button against the cuddling baby if i turn it on and keep it away from him its a miracle but he can never touch it or go near it or it will turn off immediately i have to watch these crycalmcrycalm dramas over the baby monitor and its infuriating the fisher price snug a puppy stays on for minutes once pressed i thought it was annoying at first why cant i turn this thing off but now i get it this thing could be revolutionary but it amounts to junk because the very sensitive button is smack dab in the center of the glowing and moving tummy which of course is where any baby or toddler will want to touch and cuddle immediately please make a new version that stays on and contact me or send it to me this thing is amazing when i play keep away with it but totally impossible to use for the purpose of self soothing just mom initiated and overseen soothing not good for babies who can move on their own
2,i usually like coats and wraps with highwaisted belts but this way too high and the fit was really unflattering i can see it being chic on a tall slender person but its definitely not right for my short curvy body returning it today
2,high hopes with so many great reviews unfortunately this is way too sweet on the bright side the kids love the sugar rush and candy bar like sweetness so stars for that cool whip and cup of sugar with the cream cheese then jello and the sweet syrup strawberries next time ill find another version of this with a lot less sugar and using heavy whipping cream
2,the price is high and i have to dry clean this no thanks
2,in itself i find the otter great unfortunately we had already for the second time a model which after a few weeks is defective the button on the belly for automatic on and off was both times suddenly defective and does not work anymore the different sounds songs the light and also the optics are very nice and soothing and our daughter has become so accustomed to falling asleep with the little and i also that we will now probably or badly order one for the third time and hope that this will last longer this time
2,this jacket looks like such the statement piece online with the soft focus lens but in realitymeh i think the pattern is gorgeous and would have worked without the studs and the studs are unique and would have worked on a simple solid color but put them together and you have the unwanted love child of a laura ashley bag and a marching band jacket to me it all felt more cloying than clever the quilted fabric and boxy cut of the jacket also makes it unwieldy and uncomfortable since i
2,too thin at bottom where lace is couldnt sit in the dress without worrying i was hanging out
2,all ok but the sound quality was not good
2,cute weird toy imo overpricedreturn it my daughter doesnt like this otter
2,what a beautiful comfortable material and the colors are stunning im so disappointed at the unflattering cut it fits like a shapeless tent even the arm holes have big gaps that arent snug i am lbs and ordered the xxs petite
2,very beautiful colors unfortunately the cut is much too tent like and it looks like a maternity top on me i like a flowy bohemian top but this one was too much for my tastes sadly i sent it back
2,so i recognized the fact that this dress was likely intended more for lounging than for wearing out and about but i once had a lot of luck with dresses of this price point and intent at retailer so i had hopes i was just wanting it to be a great addition for vacations and beach days but its honestly so thin i couldnt even see it working that well for that its also cut smaller than i was anticipating judging by the way it fits the model my usual small was way more bodycon than i was anti
2,the dress is too loose and runs too big
2,product description is wrong about srgb it is not this has to be corrected apparently flipkart doesnt verify air flow from the vent is directed towards screen the reasoning is beyond me
2,great hopes but a sorry disappointment at this price one should be able to expect better pattern alignment as shown on model the pattern in the garment i received was poorly matched on either side of the button placket i am and ordered xxs garment was significantly oversized i would have had to order one and probably two sizes smaller to achieve a decent fit because of the oversizing the shape is more boxy than it appears in the catalog photo sadly this buttondown has to be retur
2,bad
2,you want to talk about perfect tv let me tell you about peaky blinders cillian murphy as tommy shelby is just unreal those piercing blue eyes tell more story than most actors can with a whole monologue every single moment hes on screen youre trying to figure out whats going on in that brilliant mind of his the way they bring postwwi birmingham to life is incredible the smokefilled streets the lighting the outfits everything just feels so authentic and dont even get me started on the soundtrack using modern rock music in a period piece shouldnt work but holy cow does it ever it makes everything feel so fresh and intense what really got me hooked was how the show makes you start thinking like a shelby you find yourself trying to stay one step ahead wondering what tommy would do in each situation even when theyre doing questionable things you totally get why theyre doing them a perfect that had me wanting to buy a flat cap and move to birmingham
2,if youre pregnant congratulations this shirt is for you if youve ever dreamed of being an xxs this shirt is also for you im a d normally a small or medium but often size down to xs in swing tops the xs is ginormous on me although it fits through the shoulders i can hold onto the bottom and stretch my arms straight out at the sides its that wide think flying squirrel what doesnt show in the pictures is that it also has a slight dolman sleeve which makes it look wide at the to
2,beyond surprised i actually did not think this was going to be at par with the game but hbo did an amazing job keeping it original as well as giving credits to the game lets hope it stays that way though and merle is back if you are not familiar she plays marlene in the game cant believe they brought her back to reprise her role acting was just off to a great start lets hope it stays that way for the rest of the season episode i think for those who havent played the game you most definitely should check it out its an absolute masterpiece time to go play the game again
2,i agree with the other reviewer the colors were fabulous but it was boxy and fit me like a sack the slits on the side really detracted from the cute fabric and the hood drooped way in the back due to being able to pull away from the slits it was really a cute idea and im sad it didnt work i started not to order it based on the first review but i wanted to give it a chancei should have listened
2,it doesnt have iris graphics
2,i bought it for my grandson he was months old and not interested at all to play he is too boring and not interesting to fall asleep either too bad he is ignored to this day
2,i liked the colors of this dress and the material was fine but i could not tell from the pictures that the seams at the waist are atypical and frankly unflattering they are scalloped at the hips so it looks horrible if you have any hips at all
2,i was so excited when i purchased this top it was going to be my go to for running around as it looked super cute with leggings and boots the softness alone made me feel like i was wearing my pajamasso comfy that all changed after one washingit is now pilling and not nearly as soft as before makes me sad but it is going back
2,the class ten card failed and jamed my phone a kyocera rise it was replaced with another regular h d gb sandisk card and is working fine the micro sdhc cards are less in price than they used to be and are a best buy by faryour music paljoe mal
2,got the coral reef color in a size medium for reference i say i am because its easier than explaining that i am really and lbs c bra sizewise i am all over the place recently i lost weight and have been buying smalls and mediums and anywhere from an to a from retailer i so wanted to love this suit and am still in love with the fabric and colors everything in the medium fit except for the bra cups i am not especially big but there was zero cup room
2,i loved this top online and even more when i opened it up however the quality of the stitching is poor where the seam comes together at the hip on both sides the stitching is very loose and appears to be coming undone i was bummed and am sending it back today
2,i hang on to the edge of my seat with each episode bringing more strength and light to their situation if you cant watch things that make you uncomfortable than this isnt the show for you but if you can bare with it the strength behind these woman is incredible one of my absolute favourite shows
2,the design is beautiful but it was thick and too warm for a summer event i was planning on wearing it to also the seam below the chest was uncomfortable needed to return
2,it wasnt that good
2,this dress looks great online with boots as shown when it arrived and i tried it on it fit great on my arms wasnt too tight on my neck but once it went down over my chest c the dress never came back in to show my feminine waistshape it just looked like a big trash bag on me very disappointing similar to a mumu
2,bad acting no storyline slow and the idiot cameraman cant hold the camera steady i also hate it when it starts at the end i dont understand the good reviews
2,meh i agree with another user that this recipe is quite bland not very sweet when you bite into the bars there is a beautifully creamy fluffy texture but not much flavor the crust is the best part i think tastes like shortbread cookies the custard section seems to be missing something this recipes was really a lot of work i do not plan to make these again
2,loved these in store when i tried them on but was in between sizes so i ordered them in the larger size boy do i regret that these stretch out so much i have to wear a belt with them and it gives me this saggy bunchy front when i sitnot attractive wish i could return them but i took the tag off and wore them not knowing this before hand if in between sizes definitely size down
2,given that i am petite with thighs take a size p or p these were not for me the run small are really tight from the thigh up run longer that a petite should and are fairly thin on top of that the zipper and hook in the back are really inconvenient i was looking for something i could wear to work and these were not the right style for that plus they seemed cheaply made like they wouldnt stand the test of time i imagine if you are tall and skinny like the model they would look good
2,i mix spice cake mix with large can pumpkin and egg get the same results so quick and easy pour into a buttered x pan follow baking directions for the cake
2,i cant believe all of the five star ratings for this cake it was very bland and boring the picture looked so pretty and the recipe sounded great so i tried it we ended up throwing out the whole cake minus two piecesmaybe it was the jiffy cake mix which i thought had a strange taste i dont know it may have been better if the pineapple was in the actual cake too who knows but it definitely needed something else
2,i really wanted this dress to be perfect but the skirt portion flares out in a way that was not flattering the other reviewer is about inches taller than me perhaps it works better on a taller frame
2,a mishmash of everything that went right that obviously went wrong
2,on a positive note the dress was very well made great quality as usual from retailer however this dress looked like a sack i believe it may have been the combination of the drab color and the sack like shape very plain and unflattering for reference i am lbs c so i do have a shape it just did nothing for me it had to go back
2,i wanted so much to love this dress but unfortunately the fit was so poor i had to return it the color of the dress green was lovely and i liked the fabric and the overall design very much i read the reviews and decided to order an extra small petite given that reviewers said the dress ran large but even at that size the dress was too large especially around the hips which for someone with an hourglass figure is saying a lot the extra fabric around the hips belled out some making
2,im about lbs and ordered a size the print on the fabric is as expected but the shape of the dress and fit were not good at all i probably would wear a instead of the but could tell that even if i had the the cut of it still wouldnt be flattering on me at all it was baggy in odd places and had no shape the outer fabric is very sheer and see through and the lining is nice with a fitted slip design
2,is there such thing as too fluffy of a pancake the batter was extremely fluffy to the point i that they would not completely cook through on the stove top and had to be finished in the oven which resulted in a flat heavy pancake once completely cooked through
2,less than hour battery capacity
2,loved it online for its modern cut and print however when i received the item i was disappointed i ordered my usual size and i was swimming in it i like oversized things and understand that this dress is made that way however this was not flattering i would say i would have needed to size down to a and perhaps it would work but i didnt want to take another chance the material seemed almost crepey which i wasnt neccissarily expecting either bummer that it didnt work out
2,i ordered these jeans twice because i love them the first pair were mismarked by about sizes so i reordered second pair still didnt fit they run really small i would probably need one maybe two sizes larger than normal to achieve the fit and feel of the other skinny jeans in my closet
2,i enjoy the content and story line but the actors and actresses chosen are goose eggs gomez is supposed to be charming charismatic and energized luis guzmàn does not fit the gomez swagger morticia shows more emotion than she should her character portrays more emotional and expressive than the past morticias catherine is a phenomenal actress but lacks the emptiness jenna ortega is a fabulous actress but she looks like she is she does have the facial and blandness of wednesday but does not suit the characters age there are many other actors and actresses that could have portrayed these characters in a better way
2,she does not blink things like that make it so much more immersive and just a little creepy i love details like that in shows and movies because i may not consciously catch it but it still makes the character more complex and real so you may be asking why i have this at stars the writing is not well done wednesdays motivations do not make sense in the addams family universe it feels like they wrote a young p i story and then they added wednesday into it for the name recognition luis guzmán is a good actor but in this i do not see the charisma that is needed for the role i found him annoying catherine zetajones i think she is phoning it in the few moments that it feels like wednesday addams show are great the one or two times that it happens this is not a good addams family show it had potential i wish it could have lived up to that i loved the addams and munsters when i was a kid in the s it is sad to see the remakes and reimagining when it does not seem like the people that are making them understand what made the originals great i do not think in years people will be talking about this show like they do with the addams and munsters and it is the same with any of the new remakes if you are going to remake something that is loved you need to be a good writer and understand what makes something great know that it is not your work understand and have love for the source material if you start putting your story into it the fans normally will recognize it as something new and with the name of the work we loved it feels hollow and i see it as a mockery it is why i think people call things like this fanfiction
2,build quality of acer nitro from or years ago was much better than this the keyboard seems relatively flimsy for a gaming laptop the worst design flaw of this laptop is that the display opens up in such a way that that the hot air from the fan vents hit one side of the bottom of the display which starts heating up this most definitely reduces the life of the display it doesnt feel as if this laptop nitro model is durable enough to last more than a couple of years
2,got this in wine very pretty and soft but so sheer even with the dark color one would have to wear a cami returning for this reason having to wear a cami wrecks the otw ultracomfort
2,as soon as i saw this dress i absolutely fell in love with it when i got it i noticed it was slightly small but figured i could deal with it i was packing for my vacation and tried it on again just last night and i noticed the bow is coming off the back i could fix it but honestly a dress shouldnt start falling apart before you even wear it its cut on the small side wish i tried the larger one but now its sold out and i was kind of disappointed there were no pockets as pictured i
2,when i ordered this dress i thought to myself hmm it seems a little close to showing some side boob but maybe thats just the angle of the photo flash forward to me trying it on in my home yep thats some side boob it is very low cut under the arms if youre super slim this might be a good look but on a curvy gal with some boobs it was obscene also im a solid in most retailer brands so i ordered a l and an xl just in case the xl wouldnt even zip up returning
2,ill give stars for flavour but no way do these cookies deserve a high rating i followed the recipe exactlythe two inches apart should be been the dough is way too soft and just runs into a big mass of a dough sheet i reviewed the recipe because i thought i had made an error but no sorry but there are much better recipes out there for soft molassses and ginger cookies
2,i ordered a small from the online shop knowing it would be drapey but its much more than drapey and the front draping looks like halloween costume material not chic or sophisticated sadly i will be returning this top
2,adorable foxes i was smitten in the store but the fix is bizarre and the foxes dont come up very high so youre limited in the length you can wear i bought the ml based on salesperson advice and i cant imagine trying anything smaller i usually wear a size s or bottom these were super snug back to the store they went
2,why why would you do this why would you take one of the most incredible cast of characters one of the most thoughtprovoking set of relationships and one of the most inspiring families in literature and film and turn it into a joke wednesday hating pugsley the addams parents ignoring their kids morticia threatening her kid do netflix writers read a wikipedia synopsis of these shows and think oh yea ive got all the info i need to go ahead and slaughter this beloved gem now before they sit down at their desks its either that or they are incapable of understanding story telling character building and subtlety and just trudge through shelves of beloved stories and movies just assassinating every character they come across its infuriating to think that they do this for the sake of money theres no way in hell that this show has an from the general public it just smells fishy and to think that one of my all time favourite directors was an accomplice to this debauchery is even a bigger insult a nastier spit in the face i could hardly get through one episode anyone who worked on this should be ashamed of themselves next time write your own story before destroying beloved characters that have existed for years that you do not understand the only reason i gave it stars is because we still need space below the bar for true garbage like days and the like
2,im a little late to the party but decided to watch this all the star reviews are valid great acting and as usual tim burton shows his brilliance jenna ortega is amazing her facial expressions are priceless her timing is unparalleled the dark humor is perfect all of the characters just fit im an old guy and i loved watching the addams family when it was on tv they did a great adaptation of the wednesday character actually all of the characters were great the cinematography was awesome i will be watching this again theres so many series out there but this one is the best ive seen in a long time
2,no display quality very low performance not suitable for multitasking even for ms office and chrome
2,bad when i started started on the second or third episode i was able to get thru about episodes and gave up if it wasnt for the guy who plays the witcher i may have continued the only character i really like was dandelion yenneler was ok until of course she was made attractive but cavil imo is awful his constant grunting was an annoying and he just didnt have any kind of charm panache frankly he was boring to watch even whilst fighting etc it was also confusing with the princesss the back and forth scenes the acting was decent but the story itself was tedious and confusing and the witcher ruined it for me edit to add ive since watched the tudors and love cavil in this at first i dint until i realized who he was i watched all the episodes of season and was like is this it but i guess since cavil is leaving they are splitting it up idk but its ok this far and i hope they make it really memorable since this will possibly be the last update after season i was impressed with the first episodes then it became a redundant mess the episodes were wasted on none sense the episode ciri walks around the desert is meaningless i took forever to get into this show series was a chore season was better and isnt very good so far i hear there is episodes but then it says i it ends like this its atrocious i really hope there are a few more episodes and how did the fake suri get to milthguard
2,screen is not good as expected and sometimes the laptop doesnt get on without power supply or charging even if it has more than battery level
2,every single time i was in a store this dress caught my eye there was never a large or xl to try on however so when a free shipping offer came up i took a chance and ordered both the xl was too large the large was much better but a little snug so if it shrunk i would have been out of luck if i would have kept one it would have been the large however they are both going back a plaid dress sounds like a good idea for the winter when you look at it on the hanger but on a body it is
2,i made this recipe after reading all the great reviews i was very disappointed in these bars all the butter and whipping cream overpowered the rhubarb there is way too much crust for this recipe half the amount would be much better also since these bars have to be stored in the fridge the chilled crust ended up being hard would not make these again ill save my rhubarb for recipes where the rhubarb can really shine
2,i was leery of purchasing this blazer online without any reviews to readand now i know better the color and fabric are nice and what you would expect from the photos the sleeves however ran small compared to the body the shoulders also pulled and felt narrow compared to the torso the body the oppositetoo large and not flattering on an hourglass figureno darts no fitted places nothing making it tailored to fit open it hung wide with an unflattering silhouette buttoned it sprea
2,i usually buy a pair of these kind of pants every year from this brand they are lightweight sturdy and very flattering to my curvier body this brand can run big so i usually buy a size rather than my normal size i was going to wait it out and let someone else try them first but then i caved and ordered them in two sizes and because they didnt label them etc anymore these pants still look well made and have cute little details but they are bigger than ever the s
2,i love the look of this dress but it runs very large i am lbs i ordered the extra small on sale got a killer deal on it i intended to use it as a beach cover up since its sheer but when i tried it on i felt like i was wearing a mumu even for the price for the beach i am going to return it im sad because it is a beautiful coverup and for what it is i think the quality is good
2,wanted to love this dress pretty fabric and colors i think it would be more flattering on a taller woman im ordered a s this just looked like a nightgown on me sorry to say its going back
2,this might look good on you if you are very tall and slim i am a curvy medium and this was not at all flattering it is a straight cut and hugs in the wrong places the color is not true it is black stripes on gray not cream i thought the stripes might flatter my shape but alas i did not look good in this the material is very nice soft and stretchy
2,if i stopped eating for a couple of months or jumped into a time machine and set the dial for i would really enjoy this beautifully made delicate blouse the problem area is evident looking at the photo the tiny tight fitted gorgeous bodice i will keep this piece becasue i love it so and the apocolypse is apparently imminent and i have hardly any food in the house
2,i loved this sweater when i saw it online and ordered right away i purchased a s and the fit was very off the arms were long which i dont mind but the sweater was also super heavy and bulky so it was not at all flattering i really wanted to love it and it seemed to be of good quality but it i had to return it
2,into season and after fabulous seasons my expectations were high to say the least eight episodes in now and nothing has happenned of note i mean absolutely nothing yet it just does not matter i love every second of it the lifestyle portayed the scenery the atmosphere the acting the cinematography the subtle moodiness are all just superb every episode is riveting from start to finish and i cannot recommend this show highly enough
2,saw this online and went in to try on fit great and is true to size but i should have known there would be issues as three out of six on the rack had the sewn in tags were all but hanging by a thread i bought this for my bachelorette weekend in napa and when i put this on i noticed the straps had a few threads coming out and i thought better get this to the seamstress as soon as i get home to secure the straps well literally five minutes into the car ride to the wineries i noticed the seam
2,the basics are okay but if you follow the exact directions the batter is much too thick adding additional milk is necessary
2,nice quality fabric and design but found the armhole cut weirdly and fit of upper bodice strange wanted to love it but sadly sent it back
2,i was expecting a tee shirt but the material is more of light sweater knit in the end it wasnt the fabric that was the deal breakerit was the fit in my regular size it is too wide and boxy through the body i also felt like the arms are too big as well its going back and i am not going to bother ordering it in a smaller size its a shame because the embroidery really is lovely
2,i have loved the pilcrow hyphen chinos and have purchased many pairs however the last pairs ive ordered are all a different cut now they are no longer the chino i loved although they have the exact same name they are now boy cut and are much more narrow through the hips and thighs nowhere on the description does it say boy cut its not until the package arrives in the mail that im saddened to find this changed product with the same number it really should say this int he descri
2,i thought this would be cute with leggings based upon the length on the model i forget that the models are almost feet tall this has a polyester slip goes under it that snaps onto the shoulders it came down to my knees and was completely like a sack no leggings and boots with this one lovely material but not at all figure flattering
2,ok it looks white and tastes good but i dont like the inside at all i hate it nasty nasty white cake ever
2,if you have a gopro get a different card it worked in mine for a while then stopped turns out the gopro fried it no fault of gopro but through sandisks error sandisk will replace it but it can get fried again ive read up on it and its a common issue so if you use this for a gopro get a samsung or patriot or something else to be on the safe side
2,too sweet would just use a little ketchup and not add brown sugar or add very little
2,just received these and they fit perfectly but the panels are different shades of gray the color is not consistent and it make them look bad they are perfect otherwise but sadly they are not wearable i will be returning
2,dont buy this product hanging and lag problem display automatic on off battery backup is not good and processor is not good acer brand and flipkart service is very bad and poor dont buy
2,material is so thin this shirt ripped in three places after wearing only once got a size larger than i needed as i have a larger chest and even though its a bit lose the thread has ripped material on my chest and in the armpits
2,i didnt like the heating noise in the laptopand also it is slow in performance this is not a good laptop so guys pls dont buy it
2,this top is gorgeous and beautifully made however the fit leaves a lot to be desired the other parts of the straps pucker out and do not lay flat on your skin i tried to make this work but just couldnt so its going back
2,living here on maui i looked forward to watching the white lotus filmed at the four seasons hotel at wailea opening scene of the local terminal at honolulu airport was my first exposure to the offputting yellow filter used throughout the series the yellow filter absolutely ruined and deliberately misled viewers as to the normal intense beautiful color shades abundant on maui particularly affected by this horrible yellow filtering is the color of the ocean the flowers and fauna and the sunsets patently abusive of ugly filter i hope at sometime in the future a nonyellow filter season version is released i loved listening to the hawaiian chants throughout the episodesat beginnings and ends of each episode however the insipid jungle caricature background music in many episode scenes was annoying and distracting note to the producers dont disrespect hawaiian culture in your next series foray filmed in hawaii i downvoted this series for the yellow light and insipid music only two actresses worth watching in season natasha rothwell as belinda joylene purdy as lani both of these women portrayed their job and life situation very true to form of service industry workers here on maui i rate each of them as for their performances the remaining actors actresses and acting in the season series is stilted disappointing and predictably annoying satire stupid lines and mechanical performances for a paycheck not well acted satire in my opinion after watching season if season opens with yellow filtering i wont waste my time viewing it summarizing my review season of the white lotus is a waste of anyones time and not worth watching if youre hoping for a well written and acted series set with a true depiction of maui daylight and evenings and its rich cultural heritage as the background this program is as the ugly american as you can get and very disrespectful of maui hawaii and hawaiians
2,i had high hopes with the other positive reviews but it didnt work on me nice stretchy fabric and nice length but it was bunchy in the front and didnt lay well and didnt do my bust any favors maybe better on those less pear shaped hopeless on me
2,i have seen episodes of wednesday at this point it took me about one week in three sittings to watch the first one and i fell asleep before the second one could end i dont think ill torture myself any further i dislike this show on more than one level reason i dont like teen drama and this is bad teen drama its like the kids in twilight went on a school trip to hogwarts and brought their useless heartthrobs and jealousies with them from the th minute of the first episode we get to know that the kids are not just humans and they belong to species that could rule the world but no they go to school just for the sake of being a pain in eachothers back wednesday goes through all this wearing the same exact face for the whole time again like bella in twilight and every once in a while she drops an aphorism that has already been a meme on the internet for the past years reason this is not wednesday addams i am a fan of the original series in black and white and i was already disappointed when thing was made to walk around in the movies the addams were always an eccentric family but they were depicted as humans in this new show vampires werewolves mermaids magic etc are dropped in the story cauldron on day one removing any relatability between the characters and the audience even wednesday has some magic power of sorts her moral compass keeps swinging she is proud to be some sort of careless queen of death but then she tries to save someone for no specific reason the characterisation is terrible and even the acting is not particualrly convincing we are lightyears away even from christina riccis wednesday reason its boring the addams family was a fast witted show every second there would be a new thing to laugh for something that would hilight the difference between the boring regular people us and the mentally free and selfindulgent addams family this new show is slow nothing happens apart from a few unremarkable jokes every now and then there is no direct contrast between normal people and anyone living at the school there is no fun in following detective wednesday venturing around the victorian rooms of this american hogwarts reason i am not american while the original addams family was just funny to watch regardless of ones background this one is set in a rich american boarding school in which obviously most people in the world have never been secret societies rowing competitions houses is stuff that is alien to most people including me reason there is no moral complexity here wednesday is immediately depicted as a rebellious teenager who wants to move away from her parents as much as possible she is made to look like an outcast but she is thrown in a school for outcasts where she is not an outcast anymore needless to say the moment she meets a normal guy hes happy to help bottom line are you a teenager and you want a modern version of harry potter set in a rich americans boarding school you might like this show if you ever in your life liked the addams family then avoid wednesday
2,this dress is beautiful and extremely well made if you can get into it the only way to close the dress is a line of difficult to button buttons up the back its form fitting so youd better be on your yoga a game or have a loved one or hand maiden to lend a hand i thought about taking it to a tailor to install a hidden side zipper but its soooo form fitting im afraid i wouldnt wear it
2,for a couple weeks i debated making this purchase in fear that my size would no longer be available i ordered this lovely top when it arrived i was immediately disappointed with its colorsunlike the vibrant colors in the photo the tops colors were dullmore a brown than orange and gray rather than lavender had the fit been better i would have kept this item despite of its color its cut weird though it runs slightly large i felt the top was ill fitted through the upper bust and
2,i found these wipes to be too dry to effectively remove my makeup a double cleanse is definitely required with these removing eye makeup with these wipes was a struggle not as good as other simple wipes i have tried quite tough in the skin this review was collected as part of a promotion
2,this product leaves a lovely fragrance to your laundry however i hate the absolute arrogance of unilevercomfort to design a large heavy bottle without incorporating a handle when trying to pour it out holding it with one hand with the lid in the other it is most likely going to spill out all over your hand and the floor so i wont be buying it again
2,i find it a very sweet idea you music is great that light is pleasant also the heart tones etc very soothing however as soon as you turn on the breathing it is going up and down the belly sooo loud that sleep is not really to be thought of
2,awful color horribly wrinkled and just a messso disappointed
2,simply magnificent this is what star wars is take a bow dave filoni and jon favreau
2,i was excited to get this romper but it just didnt work im petite with a large bust and the blousy design of the top portion just hung like a bag on me returned
2,i originally bought this dress in the store however it ended being a size too big so i reordered the smaller size online although it was backordered for a month when it arrived i noticed the sleeves were not cinched like they are in the picture as well as the original dress i had purchased instore i thought maybe it had been a fluke so i returned the dress and reordered it again because it is a great dress the second one just arrived and the sleeves are not cinched as well this may
2,i tried this shirt in the purple motif it fit true to size my normal small worked well all was good on the front turned around to admire the slight detail of the neckline in the back and all i could see with the red thread the designer used to sew their tag in really on a white shirt it annoyed me so much i didnt buy the shirt
2,windows app not soport game amulator not supotte
2,it took me a long time to actually sit down and start watching handmaids tale i based my opinion on the poster and dismissed the show thinking it was too light god was i wrong the acting is outstanding even though there are lots of close ups i guess thats bothering a lot of reviewers and it does tend to be a bit slower than most of the other shows it is done so tastefully and it only adds to the weight of the situations june is going through it is most certainly not a comedy although there were moments where i actually laughed out loud like when serena organizes a handmaids gettogether anyone its a heavy drama filled with moments that will force you to react emotionally in fact it plays with your emotions the whole fuking time so prepare to cry your soul out with the characters as well all in all i think this could easily be the best show ive ever seen i dont wanna get ahead of myself of course lets wait for the continuation but i would definitely very warmly recommend this to anyone being a man or a woman in fact i think everyone needs to see this blessed be the fruit
2,ugh i hate that this didnt work the top shouldersleeve portion is so pretty and unique but the fabric is overall this and cheap feeling the length is too short for how flowy the shirt is the sides go way up on me the fabric feels like something that would fall apart after one wash back it goes
2,i bought it for a samsung s and had continuous problems of messages saying it wasnt connected etc replaced it wit the equivalent trascend and never had a problem for the past several months it would work on a pc with ana adapater and then failed to format in any device so i had to rma given the lifetime guarantee a hassle
2,the quality of the garment is higha nice substantial yarn and a pretty crochet pattern but the cut was totally off for me im usually an xss and was swimming in the xs the arms in particular were huge and drapey and the whole thing just hung on me for reference im lbs
2,i know im seemingly a minority in my opinion of the show but i thought nothing about the plot itself made much if any logical sense wednesdays personality wasnt particularly solid i dont understand why she would care about most things she suddenly cared about because it went against her actual morals although the scenes were pretty nice to look at most of the time there was no uniqueness intrigue or excitement in the story itself i personally didnt like any of the characters much which is not the actors fault jenna did a great job as did a few others it was mostly because of the terrible writing but also wrong casting i didnt think any of the other actors of the addams family fit the characters but maybe they would have done a better job if the material and directing was actually good ill never know though i just thought it felt like they were playacting not like they actually inhabited the roles i didnt like how all the male characters were basically portrayed the same none of them were particularly interesting personality wise the value of the production made me feel like i was watching riverdale with a dash of legacies i gave the whole season a fair shot although i liked a few scenes i was extremely bored and had a rough time getting through the whole thing not sure why some people are surprised that something bad has tim burtons name on it since he hasnt produced things of quality in a very long time i say this as someone who used to be a big fan of his work i really wanted to like this show but sadly i do not i know this review is pretty harsh i was channeling my inner wednesday xx
2,well im episodes in and this is proving to be a snooze fest i only tuned in because i usually really enjoy aubrey plazas performances so far this ones not doing it for me her most engaging and titillating performance thus far was when she pinched her boobs while attempting to arose her cold inattentive zombie husband none of the characters are remotely likeable or relatable its all been about character development of very uninteresting people all sad unhappy and depressed i have yet to laugh the only reason im giving this a star is merely for scenic italy maybe something interesting may happen next week and surprise me or maybe not
2,ive been wearing these shorts for years i work outside and it was great to have comfortable jean shorts that were just the perfect length the fabric quality on these shorts and many many other retailer items has gone down sure theyre great when you try them on in the storesoft comfortable flattering but when these are worn for a day they get so stretched out that i feel like i need a belt to keep them on i wore these several times sat down on a relatively smooth concrete wall and a
2,entertaining dark comedy drama set in the beautiful island of hawaii some absorbing characters played with style by the likes of coolidgedaddariosweeney but all surpassed by the superb murray bartlett as armond
2,i wanted to love this dress i saw it in the catalog in blue and wanted it however for some reason i took my sweet time in ordering it and by the time i did only the orange was available but on sale i was so excited when it arrived and as i was trying it on i thought this is a bit shorter in the skirt than i usually go but its so pretty and then i couldnt get my right arm in the sleeve at all i wondered if i had caught some of the lining as i was putting it on or something but n
2,i wanted to like this and even considered getting it altered but just decided to return it runs big and from the front it looks good but the back just looked like a big oversized stretched out tank it was so comfy on though and not sheer or revealing so if youre tall go for it
2,nobody can defeat thomas shelby cant wait for new season
2,this skirt looks cute online but it has several issues the slit is very high this photo is deceptive look closelythe slit is actually to her finger tips you cant wear any kind of spanx or control top tights slits on both sides so when you walk they fly away the micro mini slip bunches the fine knit is very snagable the skirt is very long it is going back
2,i so wanted to love this top i ordered the blue which is blue and orange i thought the orange would be brighter it is not it is a dull color also im usually a medium this top fits fine on my shouldersbust c but it was huge around the waist making me look a lot larger if this top were a bit smaller around the waist i would keep it but it is going back
2,the style was really cute but the fit was huge i ordered an xs i dont think going to the xxs would have helped i ended up returning it
2,the plush is nice but baby constantly comes out the mechanism of the otters back which is very heavy and when baby throws through the face it hurts plus sounds of weird mechanisms oar moment im not sure of durability in short im very disappointed with the product i dont recommend despite the comments ive been able to read before ordering
2,season is a masterpiece got ahead of myself but to begin with this show will take you on a journey itll engross you so much that its hard to stop watching the acting the characters the cinematography the costumes and damn the storyline its such a great show that you demand more more of it some might find it a bit slow but its worth it the way the story progresses is just up up the twists and such a prefect depiction of early s absolutley stunning im completely blown away this deserves a position in the top s its that good
2,objectively a nice ideabut the mechatronics spins completely the abdominal movements are catastrophe it squeaks totallyunfortunately ive destroyed the packaging already because i cant exchange it
2,i am not particularly large but i have thighs this pair of pants was totally unflattering my butt looked fine but everything else looked bigger and my legs looked like stumps i now understand why its on sale you may like these pants if you are tall and thin legged but otherwise skip them plus the material seems like it would discolor or stain easily i had a pair from retailer in the same material last year that developed an odd discoloration the first time i wore them
2,i disliked this dress it didnt fall on me the way it falls on the model pictured i think it would work well for tall thin women with a smaller chest i am petite with a larger chest and it accentuated my chest in an unflattering way and managed to make me look frumpy at the same time not recommended for petite women
2,i agree with the reviewer that said this product photo is misleading you cant possibly wear this sweater off the shoulder as pictured it does however provide a great fit i sized down from large to mediumand the brown color is really pretty
2,after the second wash the stitching in the armpits completely fell apart after sewing it back up wearing it and washing it a third time the stitching in the other armpit completely fell apart as well not sure if this was just a fluke but it was very disappointing now that both armpits are sewn and all other stitches are intact i must say that this is a great dress i would have returned the dress to retailer but ive already washed and worn it so againvery disappointing i would say
2,i hate to be so negative but i cant believe this shirt has so many positive reviews it is stiff silver lace and hangs funny if you have a chest adding a cami undnerneath makes it worse looks cheap
2,i would not recommend these pants if you have a curvy or athletic figure these pants seem to be cut straight up and down the fabric is not soft the color is slightly more muted in person and they are not as relaxed as they appear to be on the model
2,after purchasing laptop i got fingerprint issue after that im reinstall windows this issue is fixed now im facing this issue again please help after using of few days of usage this issue any apperance how to overcome this issue
2,i ordered this shirt online and just received it in the mail the floral design is nice but the mesh fabric in the back is low quality and cheapens the look of the shirt especially considering the price most disappointingly the neck hole is almost as small as the arm holes with no zipper or button opening i could not fit my head through the opening and thus could not even put the shirt on needless to say i will be returning it i ordered the xs so it is possible that larger sizes do n
2,ok not good
2,we wanted to try this based on all of the good reviews but we did not like it little flavor and a lot of work
2,too wide the design is cute but the wideness of the overall piece and arms made me lose my shape you cant see your figure underneath at all i dont like pieces like that this went back
2,ive been waiting to purchase this top for some time thinking it would be perfect weight for fallwinter im pretty disappointed since i dont live close to an retailer i typically order a size up to avoid returns and usually end up with items that fit just right or a little loose which is no big deal this sweater however i was swimming in like a child in an adult sweater it was huge and not to mention unflattering on my short fuller shape i wasnt impressed with the material either it f
2,looked really cute on the hanger so i took it with me into the dressing room the fabric is super soft and the top is very flattering however the bottom is way too short you cant tell from the picture but the sides are rounded and go up higher on your leg the model has the waist band pulled lower than i think youd most likely be wearing it making the outfit appear longer i wish i could pull this offmaybe im just too old for it
2,this sweater was pretty short beyond that when i raised my arms the thickness of the sweater caused the shoulders to rise up and stay there when i put my arms down
2,i ordered this top because it was percent cotton and a cute design when it arrived i thought it was a cute different top uniquely designed when i tried it on it looked like a had several extra rolls due to the ruching and was very unflattering it reminded me of the michelin man wearing extra tires and i am of a thin build so i did not like the perception of rolls throughout the bodice unfortunately it did not work for me i wish retailer would include more cotton tops in their collect
2,some times hangs when you work
2,i have somewhat sensitive skin and this fabric is awful in addition to it having no give feeling like it will stretch out and being slightly seethrough it is super scratchy it has little bits of what look to be tree material in the fabric awful
2,this is the widest sweater i have ever seen i laughed out loud when i opened it and then showed it around my office and everyone else cracked up too it is comically wide even when i was months pregnant the ml would have been pretty roomy on me now that im back to about a size this looks like jared from subways preweightloss pants in sweater form ridiculous
2,as another reviewer wrote this is not the same jean featured on the website same cut and style but its a light denim wash with wiskering and worn look at the knees i called customer service to see if this was a mistake and they said there was not really a way to check it unless i exchanged them i didnt want the same wrong jeans again so i opted out too bad they are cure
2,so after reading the reviews decided to just order my usual size thinking they might be a tad snug wrong they were huge i looked at the size to see if they sent me a size by mistake unfortunately small sizes sold out quality is excellent as well as style so bummed
2,i bought this top in the blue motif and loved it so so very much until i washed it it came out of the wash delicatecold cycle with small holes i am devastated because it was destined to be my favorite top for summer it is flattering lightweight gorgeous color cool raw edges vback detaili could go on and on about all the things i love about this top but now it has holes after one washing so its all for naught doover please with better fabric qa
2,a series for kids i guess might be a good one time watch when youve a lot of free time it wasnt boring moderately enjoyable nice all the characters has done their part nicely jenna ortega as wednesday adams was praiseworthy but i hoped to see the adams family a bit more but no further season is needed in my opinion probably make a spin off series of pugsley now people are gushing over a little too much over this i guess the series deserves a star rating thats appropriate in my opinion thats all from me why do we have to write such a long ass review ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
2,sandisk finally admits that defective micro sd cards cause battery failure in the galaxy s i had mine about six months before it failed completely i submitted complaint to sandisk and await their response
2,i saw tons of people raving about this piece so i had to check it out for myself i love the vibrant colors and the design and while the fabric is delicate it feels amazing and light i sadly had to leave it as the store as i am a girl with a larger chest and big hips i looked huge and it was not flattering to my shape if this dress came in a maxi with a high waist like i would be all over it it is beautiful
2,i started watching this without much enthusiasm the star wars lore has been declining for years and only mandalorians brought some sense of fulfillment lately but andor changed everything this story happens before rogue one and it has the mission of explaining how the rebellion took shape and the cause awakened through the main actors i must say they deliver perfectly no cheesy lines no clichès amazing dialogs and narrations entertaining arcs great character development and what many series lack nowadays consistency the characters dont make stupid decisions for no reason and they all have their own drives this is the star wars i want from now on and i cant wait for the next season
2,battery is not good
2,this dress was really odd i loved the quirky mixture of the blue stripe and the floral but thats about it the shape was unflattering but honestly that could be because this dress ran large i was just very underwhelmed with this dress also the hidden button zipper at the front was an amazing idea but not the best execution overall its okay just hated it on me
2,i just returned this top i agree with the previous reviewer the neckline is way too deep i ordered small and i looked ridiculous in it also the ruffles didnt look so great on me either
2,very bad experience
2,the dress was just too ill fitting and bulky and large it was more matronly looking then anything and did not fit well if you are going to try it probably size down sizes for reference im and lbs i bought my normal size and it was very large i would not recommend as its just not flattering i love one shoulder dresses and tops so was very disappointed as im an retailer devotee
2,runs small arms very short and hits in the wrong place across your chest would not recommend
2,i ordered this coat because like others i was taken by its feminine beauty unfortunately the coat showed up with the top button broken off and missing and another button hole torn open i returned that coat right away thinking that itd been damaged somehow in shipping however i began to question the quality of the coat when the second coat showed up with a broken and missing top button when i tried on the coat i found the missing button stuffed into the pocket not the quality i expe
2,i have to return this top the armholes are huge the material is on the thin side and not what i expected i cant size down i got an xxs maybe if i had been able to order a petite it would have fit better i ordered the red and i liked the color
2,really wanted to love the top was very flattering and loved the material very swingy and forgiving but way to much material i was drowning in it sized down to x small but no go
2,the dress is very pretty but the sequins are dark blue i imagined they would be silvergold given the photo but the dress is essentially light pink and blue
2,ive played the witcher and more than hours at first i looked at the character and said wtf no one looks like the characters in the game so i thought netflix will ruin the story but i was wrong as a witcher fan i really enjoyed the show and it was one of the greatest shows ive ever seen the acting performance is really good and the musics are amazing the story is between the witcher and game also there are multiple timelines so at the beginning you may get confused i recommend everyone who played witcher games before or likes magic and fantasy worlds to watch this great show
2,an average product
2,sound is too low battery last for hour minutes some times its lags
2,as someone with a large chest and a smaller waist i found this top incredibly unflattering and i like swingy tops it was too short too wide in the hips and too tight in the bust the pattern and fabric are very pretty though
2,this blouse is quite stiff i wouldnt mind the boxiness if this blouse werent so long even if you size down because of the eyelet and the cute hem it would be difficult to shorten this blouse to fit
2,having heard raves about this series and being a fairly solid kevin costner fan i was happy to see peacock plus featured all lead up seasons the first season included a setup for a far fetched family dynamic the direction of veteran actor kelly reilly is disappointing wes bentley is almost intolerable as a gender confused character with wide mood swings to match his onscreen sister so far costners performance is solid i understand this is taylor sheridans concept but i believe the character development for the principal actors is so poorly executed it becomes a distraction to an otherwise enjoyable series the adult children behaviors are so freakishly weird it is hard to focus on the good parts of this series like the historical accuracy of many of the native american parts of the script well done and the cinematography just wow also loved the focus on cowboy life and how casinos are shored up financially last but not least love the island of misfits jimmy cowhand character im still watching maybe season will improvea is all i can offer at this point
2,i wanted to love this sweater and it has some nice distinctive features that make it more interesting than your average cardigan unfortunately however i found that flared in an unflattering manner over my stomach the chest fit well though it was very low cut but then if i buttoned the sweater it made me look like at least three sizes larger the quality seemed okay but a bit thin and i was afraid that this would not hold up for long
2,i adore the feel and cut of these culottes but the quality has diminished my faith in retailer picks piles and serious wear and tear after just one day i feel as if i wasted my money
2,the skirt is totally see through unless you wear a slip even though it has a built in slip it is still see through the problem is that the slip is made out of the same super thin polyester material as the outside skirt if it wasnt see through i would keep it
2,first seasons are great th is ok last season ruins it but last episode is a real torture what started with good story telling ended in a complete disaster aka lazy writing initially i have this show an but after seen last episode i cant do that anymore i would like to rate it even lower because the whole show was ruined by laat season but it wouldnt be fair because it really started good very good probably will never try to rewatch it again because i just aint a fan that is lured with greatness but finally got bored to death because writers cant do without a novel it is easy to see where the novel ends and the point where the writers had to write their own scenario and that is not a good thing
2,a great watch tim burton has created a masterpiece series amazon and the rings of power creators should take note now this is how you adapt a beloved established ip well acted and a gripping story that unfolds across episodes likeable new characters and a respectful rendition of the characters we know and love jenna ortega and emma myers shine as our main protagonists but the whole supporting cast did a stellar job the visuals and the music were also topnotch you can tell that everyone involved poured their love into this project and it shows well done to all involved cant wait for a season and i hope it lives up to this season
2,too sweet with the brown sugar omit that and cut back on the fat please
2,it is so small performance poor
2,very low sound you need external speaker
2,this tunic could be great but there is some weird construction going on at the armhole first of all the armhole is way too low second there is a totally unnecessary side seam zipper under the arm since this is a tunic it slips over the head no problem no need for the side zipper it adds bulk and distorts the way the fabric should hang at the side
2,blows any other star wars content out of the water easily pedro pascal is probably the single best pick for a gritty imperfect character
2,the product delivered to me would not soften properly and tasted inferior to the ones i buy at tesco i had to put the pots in the microwave to get the noodles to soften up a little and then leave them for several minutes will not buy again
2,i have mixed feelings about luis guzman as gomez and pugslys character is weak and forgettable but its not about either of them this is wednesday jenna ortega absolutely shines in this role her pithy yet stoic quips are flawlessly executed she almost never blinks she embodies all the charm and commands the respect youd want out of that character i cant think of anyone who could do it better the supporting cast are all great and even thing plays an important and entertaining role with tim burton at the helm setting the tone as only he can and fantastic plot and dialogue writing this is one of the best shows ive watched in a while it goes deeper into the addams family lore than ever before it wraps up the story well but leaves you wanting more fans of the old show movies or even just fans of spooky whodunnits will all appreciate this series
2,never by this probuct
2,they look nice on the page but they didnt work on my body made me look big and boxy maybe if youre superskinny theyll be fine
2,the computer has a very weak battery it trains the power so quickly
2,when i received this dress in the mail i was thrilled i loved the color and the style although a bit too much material but comfortable when i went to show my husband the dress his first comment was very sexy i can see your underwear and your skin i dont understand why no one mentioned this in any of the comments on this dress when i went into the light i saw that the dress was see through and i sadly had to return it
2,i opened the package and the dress is two pieces it is the skirt part with an orange cami top that the sweater goes over the sweater was too short for me as i am busty and would not work i ordered my normal size and the band around the rib cage did not go from side to side so i didnt try it on
2,this white shirt is very thin esp in the front and see through i would have to wear a cami underneath unless i wanted people to see the outline of my bra it seems very flimsy and poor quality even at the sale price disappointed and will return
2,this series is well acted however thats about all that is good about this series there is character development but the storylines are all over the place dark comedy there is minimal humor throughout season and most of each episode just sort of drags on and on without much real direction i honestly tried to like the series more but given the mostly senseless plot i found myself checking the time left to each episode i was hoping for more from this series but it just never happened if there is a season three i most likely will pass it by i just dont get all the rave reviews
2,i just cant get past how different the blouse i got is from the photo mine has dark colors really dark colors this top fits a bit large and the neck is quite wide i thought it flowed well and fit nicely in my regular size large i liked the length and the fact that its shorter than shown it still covered my bum the back has a cute peplum ruffle and there are little bronze colored beads along the bottom edge in both the front and back i would have kept it had been the blouse shown in t
2,i am a sucker for a peasant dress i love anything i can toss with a pair flats and head out the door but this dress is ridiculous i look like a schoolmarm the white bib collar takes this dress into costume territory i love one september and have many items from the brand that i wear regularly so im bummed that this wasnt what i expected i knew it would have flow but its more billowy than i wanted stay away unless you want to look like a little girl on the first day of school
2,i have had the gb in my galaxy s for almost three months and there were no issues however the phone just recently started telling me the card has unrecognized files or it is empty causing the loss of my media i chose to format it after seeing the error for too long chalking it up to some random error somehow yesterday all of the files on my card magically reappeared and i was able to play my music again despite having had the phone format the card shortly afterwards the error reappeared i put the card in my computer and it is simply not appearing shame but i think this is a risky card to purchase
2,my daughter is months old and likes to cuddle at night at her otter yes i also think that the engine is quite loud but that calms my baby even further super sound selection and very nice work november the electronics is unfortunately defective the belly lifts only briefly and then seems to clamp very bad
2,the fun colors drew me to this but it sure fit weird the top was fine but it became a bit tentlike in the waist the material doesnt feel great either
2,fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and ordered it right away however i was sadly disappointed once it arrived while the cut is cute the fabric is just all wrong i was expecting a nice heavy knitlike material but this feels and looks really cheap especially given the price of the dress sadly it is going back
2,i was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately its going back because the knit is just too thin i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but its not and because its so light the swing effect doesnt really come off nothing special
2,its like a work of art but sadly not flattering on me i absolutely loved the look and even considered taking it to a tailor but the material overall is very stiff if youre teeny tiny and need something to give you the illusion of hips you might love it very sad to return this
2,it was okay i agree with some users the ingredients arent proportional it was way to moist wet almost unfortunate as it is a waste of ingredients
2,just ok i made the recipe exactly as published had very little sea food flavor noticed many of the positive reviews were from people who addeddoubled the clams hard to rate higher if modifications have to be made to make it taste good also it never thickened properly which is ok if you prefer thinner canned soup consistency
2,great exfoliating properties but fluff ends up everywhere and if youre wearing dark coloured clothes its going to make you like you have dandruff
2,i wanted this tank to work so badly it was a great deal and so beautiful unfortunately the top fitted portion ends right below my chest then the shirt flares out so i looked like a cupcake my belly also showed slightly because the shirt is short if you have a short torso this would work great if not unfortunately its not great tear
2,i tried wearing it however i thought i needed courage to wear this tank unfortunately i did not purchase this tank although i liked color and design first it runs small than the regular size it feels even smaller because my size is xs in addition it tends to exaggerate a body line i am not quite sure why this happens but maybe it is just the way this tank is if you are confident about your upper body posture then yes it would look very cool however if you have thin postur
2,they taste great but i dont understand how to get the perfect shape so i just the whole batter into the pan
2,i love everything about this except the length i am short and usually order a petite and even this is really cropped on me the quality is good thick and substantial color is great but very cropped and sleeves are long on me as well just weird proportions so sadly going back
2,loved how this top looked online and couldnt wait to get it i ordered the xs and it was huge and also very short in length compared to the picture online i love the fabric and design but the fit was totally off this is going back
2,as much as i wanted to love this top it was too flowy and and i felt like i looked bigger than i am im a size maybe a smaller size would have made a big difference
2,the neck is so big on this sweater i couldnt make it lay right the shape of the sweater is odd it is really wide on the upper torso but tapers near your waist it did not look as depicted on the model the sweater is a lovely color i liked the twotone but overall the fit was too weird for me material is soft and it felt really nice on but just too oddly shaped and a crazy big neck
2,this looked so odd on me i decided to give it to someone with a different body type and she found it really odd too the sleeve are a bit too long to be short and they are tight at the bottom the top is really large as to be unflattering perhaps its just that it doesnt work on someone who is petite but this one is a return
2,remember those cableknot cotton sweaters that were popular in the eighties thats exactly what this sweater is everywhere your body bends like elbows is emphasized by the fact that cotton does not bounce back like other finer fabrics like wool and cashmere ill pass on this
2,seeing all the other series andor provides a fresh breath into a franchise thats ultimately does nothing but reuses its own ideas even in mandalorian with the fanservice baby yoda the planetslocations which weve seen and known from before plot armor of the main hero linkage to the established characters the quality of andor is a full head above or take obiwan that is a remarkable impotency of story writing and directing having no reasons to exist but to exploit the fan base since rogue one we see another successful try to make a realism show instead of arcade creative script good acting dynamic development its great when quality and creativity wins over safebetting and prioritizing fanservice for the sake of extra cash grab i just hope disney doesnt spoil the series but knowing the company i wont be surprised still so far season is extraordinary good and is exciting completely irrelevant of any other sw lore
2,i ordered this in a b lbs because it looked like it would run big and it definitely does the fit comfortably but the cut of this dress made me look about lbs heavier than i am i am pearshaped and this dress made me look very bottom heavy so i returned it that said the material is gorgeous as it is the perfect weight and the colors are much more striking and complementary in person if i had a straighter silhouette and a larger bust this dress would have been a
2,it works but the actual rw speeds are mbs not even class it should be marketed as sandisk basic not sandisk ultra unless they mean ultra slow now is and there is no excuse for such slow card from sandisk update i have redone the test with notepro instead of using non uhsi pc and the latest results are mbs since the read speed hits i believe the device is dhsi ready still underwhelmed by the write speed though
2,oh dear the elastic waistband just ruined this skirt for meit made it look so cheap i assumed from the photograph that the skirt was a knit over a structured lining with a real waistband with a zip instead its a sweatshirt knit with no lining and elastic it looked cheap and hung a bit baggy from the elastic waist making it a nogo for me
2,i was not impressed i found the potatoes bland and needed something the chops were overcooked but i did use loin chops still an hour and a half i think would dry out most chops i wouldn t follow this recipe again without some serious changes
2,sounded good but sorry didnt care for it
2,i think this shirt would be really cute on the right body type just not mine im and a ddd a couple weeks post partum thought this could be a good shirt while im nursing bc its flowy but stylish unfortunately it did nothing for me when i put it on the cut drew all attention to my big chestnot in a good wayand distracted from my smaller lower half made me look much bigger and heavier than i actually am probably good for small chested girls very tall girls or curvy on the
2,i was so excited to get this top and while it is soooo amazingly soft i still could not keep it i must admit that i am only so i do think this had quite a bit to do with my dislike of this but i felt like a matador which is definitely not what i was going for maybe if your tall and lean this would work but for me no way
2,this sweater coat is very bulky and has an odd and unflattering shape when on
2,in season a running joke has baby grogu eating a frogs eggs these frog people are portrayed as an intelligent species and an endangered species this atrocity by a supposed innocent character future jedi is portrayed as a joke atheists joke about eating babys because it is a ridiculous charge against them but grogu is actually seen swallowing eggs several times i eat chicken eggs but chickens are not intelligent nor endangered is eating babys condoned in the star wars universe how can the human writers condone even joke about this because the frog people are not human i love this show but i deduct a point for the baby eating if a stormtrooper ate the eggs i wouldnt have said anything
2,detailed beading was beautiful its too boxy way to much fabric in the waistbust and tight on the hips it doesnt fall boxyboyfriend like the grey fabric is not soft and is lighter in color than the picture was hoping this would be my go to sweater for warmth on casual daysbummed
2,ordered a size medium as i usually take a medium in retailer coats the wool is wonderful however the stripped bands are sewn into the fabric which add to the weight the coat has an odd shape not a line or straight the medium was large on me the bottom edges of the coat did not line up when buttoned and there was no inside hook or button to help even out the bottom edges sadly this coat will be returned
2,dont buy this laptopit may looks good but i faced the problem within days and worst customer service i recieved the laptop from service center after month dont buy this product guys
2,i bought this dress online and was hoping it would be a great comfortable staple it may be the most unflattering piece of clothing i have ever tried on ever i let my sisters try it on too to see if they wanted it or liked it better but it was awful on them as well i ordered the xs in blue it was beyond enormous and was just plain and unflattering i am and i love swing dressesi just dont think is cut well
2,when i open or charge a laptop it heat in between mints and to much heat so it scare me good design but it heat to much fast
2,loved this dress online but my small pettie stature made me looks like an orphan from the prairie
2,the original cartoons by charles addams are wonderful dark subversive and witty over the years there have been various attempts to adapt them to tv and films with varying success here is the latest attempt although this time the focus is on wednesday addams this really felt far removed from the addams family origins sure the various usual characters make an appearance it has the gothic trappings etc but the narrative was more like that in harry potter set in a boarding school with wednesday having to solve a series of attacks by a mysterious monster the story wasnt really that interesting the attempts at humour really fell flat wasnt the whole point of the original addams family that they were subverting the typical american family and way of life where is anything even remotely like that here if you set it in a school for outcasts then what is the point none of the jokes work when everyone is an outcast on the plus side it looks great the actors all fit their roles well and give good performances i dont think tim burton really did a lot here it doesnt feel like he had much involvement at all
2,this show was pure drama it had everything in it hidden messages of how the world and people revolve and outstanding background music to boot i want to go and live there i loved all the characters i hope there is a season two
2,when i saw this online i wondered why this dress cost so much i have been keeping my eye on it for some time loved what i saw the design and colors and details at the neckline and waist along with pockets but was skeptical i was waiting for a sale to take a dive and here are my thoughts when i got it ___________ pros the colors you see online are exactly the same in person the jeweled neckline is lovely its one thing that drew me to it this dress had a very sophisticated appeal wh
2,my favorite colors are purple and green so when i was in the store and saw the beautiful purple flowers on the top of this blouse and all up and down the sleeves i was was blown away i was disappointed by the bottom of it just huge flowy green fabric with no design on it whatsoever i went with my first impression and bought it but now that im trying it on in the house im still bothered by the throwaway bottom of this blouse im thinking this is just another retailer maternity t
2,i was so excited to try this sweater on when it arrived but to my disappointment it was overly large i was pratically swimming in it really love the design and the way it looks on the model just didnt work out that way on me
2,wanted to like this top but it looks terrible and does not lay right the bust line is not tight enough to contrast the rest of the top being flowy does not give any shape to the body do not recommend for anyone with a medium to large chest
2,the taste was pretty good but the texture and final look didnt at all match the picture theres not enough coconut in this recipe relative to the egg whites it turned into a puddle of mess when baking
2,i ordered the in the emerald green and it was sent to me with a dime size hole in the sleeve i am very disappointed because i love the sweater by the time it arrived it was sold out in my size now i cannot exchange it for one that is not damaged if the sweater was not damaged i would recommend this product
2,i bought shirts in gold black and red they arrived larger than expected after the first wash and air dry they shrunk i would have been thrilled but they shrunk to be shorter while staying too wide also my black shirt faded a lot with one wash
2,the review above titled so disappointed couldnt have said it any better the dresses from last year are perfect i probably wear them at least once a week i was so excited to see this vibrant blue color and fully expected the same quality as last year im generally an xs or s in dresses however i have xxs from last years version and the xs in this one is lifeless its heavy hot doesnt have the same nice shape as last year i may cut out the integrated lining just to lighten the dres
2,i buy almost ever top tiny puts out and so i grabbed this one in the last tops sale since im a sucker for embroidered flowers everything about it is gorgeous except it is so flimsy i cant even believe it like when i held it up in the dressing room i could see through the entire shirt front to back before even putting it on once on i could see everything through it i actually thought i was going to tear the thing to pieces trying it on its so frail i own so many tiny shirts and while
2,great adaption of the adams family keeping wednesday in character mustve been a major challenge which they mastered quite well this time not a macabre comedy but a black detective they managed to keep the adams vibe quite well the story keeps you on your toes while being amused by the macabre jenna plays her role as wednesday very well thing plays a typical supportive role festers part is short bit fitting homes and morticias roles are a less convincing they feel like forced into character catherine seems visually fitting but something is missing for those who know the original comedies luis may not feel like a good choice for the role of gomez but their roles are limited and it doesnt really break the vibe i enjoyed it very much and hope to see a fitting nd season
2,i have been dying to try a mara hoffman bathing suit so i went for this one unfortunately the design of the bathing suit is not like what they sent me the middle where the tops meets the bottom is squared off not like that v that it looks like in this photo it also makes for major side boobsagging on each side i was very disappointed
2,its dont work smoothly
2,i remembered making a similar recipe years ago that was delicious but this wasnt it the gelatin layer wouldnt set it was just too watery probably because of the syrup on the frozen sweetened strawberries the pretzel crust was not crunchy and was total mush on day i was careful not to make any deviation from the recipe and even made it a second time which did not turn out any better i made this to take to a ladies tea at church and was quite disappointed
2,he played this role as lee child portrayed reacher in the books he nailed the role as cruise never could cruise could take lessons from richson thank you lee child for this story
2,great cheesecake but unfortunately and im surprised no one else has mentioned it this recipe yields enough cheesecake filling to easily do two cakes wish i had known beforehand as i just kept saying to myself the recipe has to be right as i kept noticing that there seemed to be way too much while i was mixing the ingredients and i wound up washing of the filling down the sink and over filling the one pan amp crust i did have and the cheesecake ballooned up and split in several deep crevices because of this get your amounts correct next time please
2,i found the fit of this dress odd i typically wear a or in dresses the fit across the chest but the armholes were large so wearing a bra would be a challenge i am a c so i need some type of support i also thought the fabric was a bit flimsy for the price i am a huge retailer fan and usually leave glowing reviews but sadly i left this one in the store
2,i ordered this in size xl in ivory it was a drab poorlymade toosmall sweater the knit material wasnt good quality and the overall fit didnt work i liked the light red color and maybe if that had been in stock then i would have overlooked the problems but there are better ivory retailer cardigans available this was returned
2,heating fault
2,would be better without the cotton cheese and the provolone in my opinion and more spices
2,worst battery performance
2,i am lbs with an athletic body type and i ordered a size small these were really baggy in the thighquadricep area and made my thighs look bulky the fabric quality is very nice and i like the idea of them for curvier body types my son commented that they looked like pajama pants and i agreed
2,i am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra its soft and fits okay but it has zero support or shape i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support if i would have seen this is the store i would have passed over it however i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it its comfortable so thats a redeeming quality i would not recommend for larger chested ladies though
2,per the other reviews i sized up and got the medium it was still tight around the girls and im not that well endowed but too big in the armholes the fabric is a kind of thin tee shirt material i kept it because im lazy but not sure how much ill wear it given the strange fit
2,bad products
2,ladies this top shrinks i am very disappointed i was in love with this top and the first time i washed it it shrunk a significant amount i did not use a dryer i laid this piece out to dry as i do with the majority of my knit tops and it shrunk it is a lot shorter and much tighter especially in my arms if you love this top i might suggest buying a size up and washing it to fit
2,my husband and i were looking for a good potato recipe and we stumbled upon this one initially our first thought was it makes too much for our little family of two so we decided to cut the recipe in half it sounded deliciousonce it came out of the oven that was a different story the amount of bacon coupled with the sour cream overpowers the dish so the balance of flavors is too rich because the potatoes are such a neutral flavor they get lost in the casserole maybe if you use less of the sour cream and bacon or more potatoes that would be the right ratio of bacon to toppings also the presentation wasnt very appealing because the whiteness of the sour cream dominates the other colorssadly this recipe will not be added to our recipe box happy cooking
2,as a fan of the books games i thought the first season was decent its an adaptation of a multibook short story collection with an overarching narrative without prior knowledge of the series i may have required multiple views to understand the timeline and events it has a similar feel to the stories though and i enjoyed it season had a great first episode and an okay finale but meandered in the middle episodes the substance of many adapted stories were altered parts that were main story in the book felt like filler and lacked necessary plot character development ill never understand why adaptations leave out parts that are important to understanding the main plot and characters yet add meaningless fluff soap opera drama some characters that dont say ten words in the books are main pov characters now season was awful before even looking at the train wreck of the content i wonder why nf released half the season when the second half will be aired three weeks why not wait and release the entire series or release one episode each week anyway regardless of the stupid release schedule the first half of season is abysmal the main actors who brought the characters to life in season dont seem to want to be there at all anymore the script writers are no longer even trying to follow the witcher stories theyre just off in the weeds doing their own thing the drop in quality this season is precipitous im sorry to say it but netflixs the witcher is no longer worth watching
2,this dress is so cute in the photo and fit true to size but the material is slinky and felt cheap the stitching was also poor quality i am so thankful that retailer will let us order a batch try on and return in storethis went back
2,i love the look and feel of the material but it was way too short i dont even have a long torso sadly its going back to the store
2,this is a beautiful vest i love the colorblocking the modern and structured style and its versatility i bought it with a defective item discount because there were some stains i promptly took it to the dry cleaners and was informed that the black would bleed onto the white paneling if they did a full wash they spotcleaned it and it did bleed although the tag says to dry clean this baby the black dye will bleed to the white fabric ill be taking it back into the store today for a ref
2,another tentlike tee this shirt is thin but not in a bad way and the color and design are really nice butit is really boxy and im just tired of that look the longer sleeves are a plus for fall
2,i saw this online and went to the store to try it on so glad i did it did not work on me at all it is so wide just did not look right it was also not flattering at the neckline either i thought it was beautiful until i had it on too bad wanted to love it
2,and hits below my waist just far enough to make my thighs look enormous i think how it fits depends alot on body type the material is nice color pretty not cheap looking so i will keep it but must wear a topper to slim down thise ugly thighs of mine
2,simple unpretentious honest and delicious these are the qualities of this show i liked it and i would like another portion please i havent read the book but i think the show is well writtenthe casting is excellent and alan ritchson for the jack reacher character is perfect im looking forward to season
2,rd quality display
2,what drew me to this shirt was the beautiful silver and gold embroidery on the front the shirt was folded at the store which makes sense because if it were hung it up fewer people would try it on this shirt is sheer from the front and more sheer in the back this is what bugs me about so many clothes that are made these days they are so cheaply made so thin with cloth that you are forced to layer with a camisole or something else in order to wear it in public i cant wear sheer clothes
2,i just bought this and i really disagree with previous review that it runs big i wear an in skirts and bought another retailer skirt last week that fits just fine this one does not even zip up i might exchange for bigger size as label is just a number to me and sizes are really inconsistent or it may just go back
2,it was so cute in the pictures and i was looking for something to wear to my trip to europe so i purchased it but it really didnt live up to my expectations im and got a s it looked odd on mea little too short on the bottom a bit too big on top and overall i thought the material looked cheap for the price i returned it
2,i bought this online with the intention of it being my graduation dress im pounds so i shouldve known better and gotten a petite style dress however i loved the modern look of this and since my boobs are a bit bigger d i figured they would help fill it out upon receiving the dress i was first shocked that for the price the construction was pretty poor quality there were strings coming out of the straps and they looked unevenly sewn when i put it on it was clear that th
2,i heard all the hype about the series and decided to watch it the first season was okay interesting characters especially the director of the hotel the worst were the two teenage girls of the mossbacher room it showed how spoiled arrogant selfish and hypocritic we have become as a society and how rich people actually behave but i got extremely bored in the second one one hour episodes unfolding veeeery slowly the characters saying and doing the same and the same over and over again with very predictable dialogs and stories suffocating inside the four walls of a hotel i only liked the last episode of the second season which was very good
2,hardware wise its ok but battery died within months and company isnt providing warranty either
2,agree with john this looks great very easy to make but despite how wonderful it looks it doesnt have a lot of flavor for folks who cant have a lot of flavorful things due to diet restrictions this may be a really good recipe good recipe to build on perhaps fry the potato slices some to golden brown in the leftover pork chop drippings add some garlic somewhere it needs more umph for me r
2,this dress was not what i had hoped from the online pictures i had high hopes but the fit was really wonky and the material seemed cheap the arm holes were too big and made the dress seem more like a bathing suit cover up than a classy summer dress needless to say its going back
2,i was so excited about this top as the picture of the model it looks beautiful and drapey in just the right way unfortunately this top feels like an old grandmas polyester suit the sides are much shorter than the front back and the combo of the inner lining and the outer fabric feels awkward with the inner piece being significantly shorter the the outer it also puffed out a bit at the top of the shoulders in a strange way due to the layered fabric sadly going back
2,this material is a nice quality but the shirt is boxy and shapeless it was not flattering at all on my shape i dont think it would look nice on anyone with an hourglass shape or fuller chest
2,thomas shelby has something of an icon he dresses the best the speaks the best he walks like no one else his almost excentric manner is crucial for the relaxed and tense atmosphere this contradiction gives the show its expressionistic look and type brilliant
2,great color but frumpy fit if you have any bust it looks a bit like maternity
2,the fabric of this top is lovely the fit not so it does not fit as shown on the model the fit is very large around the middle and fits more like a swing top i am slim build i ordered my usual size medium shoulders and back fit perfectly too much material around the middle had it had a straight cut to it as shown id keep it because it doesnt its going back
2,im normally a size p i bought these in a because i wanted a more relaxed fit i could barely pull them up over my calves i could get them on and button them but i felt like a sausage stuffed into a straw size up sizes at least
2,ive had a lot of misses from retailer lately ive loved this dress since i first saw it in the springsummer releases and gave it a try when it went on sale when it arrived i literally lol its an ill fitting nightgown the size small was a tent on me and its so flimsy and sheer it probably shouldnt be worn in public theres a short sheer slip that comes with it but unfortunately doesnt do much pass ladies
2,frumpy looked like a nightgown on me maybe better on someone younger
2,the color is a nice cool red and the material is very soft but the dress left me feeling shapeless and the bell sleeve overtook it i wanted to love it but it just wasnt working for me im and purchased a s it fits true to size however it was loose around the waist and just wasnt complimentary on me this will have to go back
2,not good for heavy works processor is too slow
2,this suit did nothing for me the top has zero support this would work for a younger woman who does not require any support and is smaller chested also the top gapped in the center it just did not fit right the top is very thin showing everything a light padding would make a big difference in this suit also i could not get a good fit as i tightened the top the back would ride up the bottoms are ok not renatkable
2,this is a gorgeous top very well made with a classy design it fits true to size from the lower chest up however at about the midbelly range the shirt widens out and basically allows a month twin pregnancy to comfortably fit in size xs i was so sad for the price i cant justify taking it for alterations it would have been the perfect top
2,this skirt lookslays exactly like the photo i bought a size small and i usually wear a size it was maybe a smidge big but nothing that affected the look of the skirt the material reminded me of feltwool mixed together almost like sunday school felt cut outs but stiffer not a fan i was underwhelmed it looked plain and simple and the color washed me out definitely not worth the price for me anyways good luck
2,battery issue and overheating
2,this world feels scarily real the acting is toptier and keeps surprising me with who shows up as the season grows this show has real people not fantasy characters with adult emotions serious choices and consequences for their actions it feels like hbo grim and darker than disneys usual shows but there are no gratuitous scenes for shock effect everything serves a purpose to move the story forward as soon as this ends i will watch it all over again ultimately this show is a masterpiece and a masterclass in storytelling thanks to everyone who brought this to the screen academy awards to you all
2,i went into peaky blinders with no expectations i knew what it was basically about and i had seen cillian murphy in nolans batman trilogy i have been beyond blown away with every season it just keeps getting better and better and murphy as thomas shelby is simply incredible if youve ever wondered what big dick energy is all about just watch tommy shelby bde radiates off that man
2,this had a cute design but an unflattering fit for me it was boxy and made my boobs look droopy
2,based on other customer reviews i ordered these trousers expecting a lightweight cropped pant that would be appropriate for spring and especially summer however the fabric is much heavier than what id usually wear in the summer the cut of the trousers were superb though i like a lowrise or hipster cut which these are they are fitted and not oversized like many of the other retailer items i buy so if you are an xs these will be xs or runs small for retailer clothing if you like your clo
2,i got the plush the engine noise makes more noise than the rest we dont hear the snoring and after minutes it didnt work anymore
2,i was really excited about this top since i have others from retailer that are similar in styling unfortunately it just didnt work out i am petite with a short torso and ordered my usual size and it was way too short in the front the top was also boxy and didnt sit right it just wasnt flattering cute top on the hanger but just not on me
2,hi i would have to agree with all of the reviewersi unfortunately had to find out for myself mistake its huge i love the quality and design but even if you sized down two sizes it wouldnt help
2,i ordered an xxs petite and this hangs like a bag on me im usually fine with the petite sizing but this didnt work and im so bummed the dress is soft the blue color is gorgeous but it fits like a bag i wanted to love this but sadly will have to return i think someone with curves will love this dress it is really beautiful quality just does not fit a petite frame
2,bluetooth is not working properly
2,i really wanted to like this top but unfortunately it is not as pretty or flattering in person the yellow looks dirty in real life not pretty like the picture it is also a strange fitshape when it is on i tried it on in the store and did not like it at all
2,i actually liked the first two seasons concluding with a great ending they were entertaining and a well made additio to the star wars universe although some of the episodes of season three are well played and directed it seems that the overall story is forced to conclude into the sequels which is the worst possible scenario season three feels incomplete and pointless at the same time too many substorylines are started but not concluding into any storyline you can follow some episodes felt totally out of touch with a complete story you could cut down all episodes to three hours without missing anything imprtant so in the end andor remains the only disney produced series worth watching
2,the sweater material was really soft and seemed wellmade the back is an interesting twist but the material creases easily i can see it looking messy by the end of the day the main reason i returned it though was because it runs very large i got my usual s and i could have sized down maybe even sizes i didnt like it enough to try a smaller size
2,i drooled over this dress online so couldnt pass up trying it on at my local retailer store while i loved the unique color in person the drape of the skirt good quality fully lines i was so disappointed with the top of this dress its very tight illfitting just plainweird i cant imagine the fit of the top being flattering on anyone regardless of chest size its a shame because otherwise the dress is adorable
2,i loved the design of this blouse and ordered it the first day it was available unfortunately i was disappointed on arrival besides being more muted colorwise the sizing is way off i ordered the xxsp and it was huge on me on the model it looks like it skims the body when in reality it falls like a tent i tried tucking it into a skirt but there was just too much fabric though the neck worked for me i can see how it might be too small for some people as it is very narrow also it
2,too big and not very soft its actually quite hard you can feel the machine underneath the thin fur so i didnt think it was cuddly enough to fulfill its intention of being a lovey
2,im and weigh lbs i purchased the xxs and it was superwide and big all over it looked like a pregnancy top and did not lay as nicely as shown on the model also not shown on the model is the front is short and the back is very long this would work better on a taller person i just find it odd that a xxs is still too big the quality of the fabric and the print is good and the laceup in the back is cute
2,but it just doesnt measure up first the sliplining comes unattached if pulled slightly and it is very difficult to actually get it on either stepping into it or pulling it over your head and once on the top was a big snug and there was too much material at the bottom which made it look really bulky unfortunately i am finding this to be the case with so many of the items i buy from retailer lately the material is really cute but the dress isnt worth the price effort
2,the cowl and cuffs of the dress are thick and heavy sweater material but the dress itself is extremely thin the nonbelted pictures do not show how much volume there is to the dress which was enormous in my normal size
2,ive been looking for the perfect white eyelet maxi feels like a perfect summer staplebut sadly this was not it quality isnt great which is surprise on a price tag top of dress is lined but cheaply so its somewhat see through the dress was returned
2,as another reviewer pointed out although the tag inside the dress says that you can machine wash in cold water the color around the popsicles will bleed this is extremely disappointing im hoping it can either be fixed with dye remover or that retailer will take this item back would only dry clean this item
2,this show is apparently generally acclaimed as excellent but is it really i can certainly agree it is beautifully shot with compelling music and performances however it left me feeling empty and disappointed billed as a subtle satire of entitled americans of a certain class this show asks a lot of its viewers pacing is too slow and the farce and comedic elements such as they are are insufficient to offset the resentment the viewer builds after having to spend so much time with such unlikeable characters the writers should have spent more time building more comedic twists and added some joy to this tart drink is this art yes certainly is this entertaining no
2,more like a flat sheet cake should have made cupcakes with frosting instead not bar like at all i did know better to add some spices otherwise it would have been a bland even though i added large bananas i also used cup brown sugar in hopes it would add more depth no chance back to the family cookbook for me
2,i so wanted to love the striped peplum top however i have a petite frame with a large chest and there was absolutely no support in the top not flattering in the least for a ddd cup will be returning i imagine this would be perfect for someone with a frame like mary kate or ashley olsen
2,the design and style of shirt is quite cute but the mountain pictures is not mont blanc nor does the mountain find itself near chamomix it is an unmistakable image of the matterhorn and the small town of zermatt is at its base
2,this might be my rd gb disk that i buy from scandiskthey work for few months and then nothingmy tablet wont detect them anymore my computer wouldnt eitherquite disappointing
2,this was not one of my favorite cakes
2,i so loved this dress online not so much in person first of all it didnt fit my build im with a f bust and the waist line was just a bit too high to be flattering mainly im returning it because of the fabric the petticoat netting does rustle as another buyer pointed out my main fault is that the top fabric is synthetic and cheaply printed basically its the lining fabric of a better made dress or coat if it were cotton voile or silk it would have been beautiful why they made i
2,this fudge was dry
2,the sweater is very comfy and looked good the first time i tried it on however the material is thin and slightly see through also after one wear it completely stretched out and made the long sleeves awkward to wear without washing in between each wear after the third time i wore it i discovered a large hole in the armpit most likely due to the excessive washing i would not recommend this sweater
2,hard to review this as the card arrived doa couldnt write to it at all and it wouldnt format i returned it and amazon was great about the credit ive owned several sandisk memory cards and they have all performed well and i was a little surprised that this one failed out of the box id read a good review of the samsung gb micro card and i bought that instead very pleased with it
2,i really wanted to love this dress i bought it for a photoshoot that will be outdoors and thought that the green color would be perfect it is well made but the fabric is lighter than expected the biggest issues was the size i am and typically a size ten i ordered the ten and it fit like a it was huge if you order this i would say size down two sizes
2,my wife and i just finished watching the last episode of this fascinating story i almost turned it off during the st one because nothing made sense at all but then the flashbacks kicked in during episode and onward and it came together i dont want to get into politics and religion and its very easy to do with this show i would categorize this series as horror almost due to the things that these handmaids are put through my wife and i look at each other and shake our heads after almost every episode and wonder what is next great show
2,product is good but not worth for money
2,why is it so difficult to find a shirt that doesnt expose half of my bra if i lift my arm this is cute beyond the arm hole issue but overpriced going back
2,really loved this dress online and was excited to try it out when it arrived it was heavy bulky in the package which didnt bode well taking it out of the bag i was surprised at how heavy thick it was the picture really looks like it would be a flowy grecian dress to throw on during a hot summer day but in the reality you might drown in sweat the interior linings promised absolutely no breathing fabric wanted to love this as the style is very cute but was disappointed by the mate
2,i bought two one in white and one in blue print and wore the blue print top once and loved it then i washed it according to the instructions on the tag in cold gentle cycle and hung to dry it shrunk up in the length and in the width and now it doesnt fit at all also after one wear the buttons are coming off before i even put it in the wash and its covered in loose threads the quality is just not there im going to return both and show the sales lady the difference in size on
2,very bad product
2,i was really excited about this skirt because i love the color however when i tried it on it was too much of a highlow i am not very tall but this would look a lot better on a tall person
2,the laptop is not working properly after days
2,i bought a petite medium and the length was right but it fit like a potato sack it was quite comfortable and didnt look completely terrible from the front but from the side it was terribly unflattering when i tried it on my boyfriend saw it and said it looked like i was wearing a nightie i dont do formfitting clothing but this was the exact opposite and flared out every which way its got to go back
2,the skirt is comfortable and as pictured it also ran tts im tall and weigh lbs i had the medium and didnt need to size up to a large when you put the skirt on a normal body it looks like you are wearing an easter egg and not in a good way
2,there is no reason to add flour to potato soup it will give the soup an artificial starchy taste simply use an immersion blender and puree the the soup when the potatoes are cooked and use real cheese
2,i usually love bordeaux so i was very disappointed with this shirt when it arrived the fabric smelled plasticy which is a first for me with retailer products when i put the shirt on i could see it had that sheen that comes from rayon spandex blend shirts i hadnt noticed that it had spandex in it when i ordered it this fabric looks and feels exactly like the cheap blends sold at discount stores i cant believe retailer is selling this
2,this review is after months of usage the day i received the laptop i found out that there is an issue with the touchpad the touchpad starts lagging if we use the touchpad for more than hours restarting the laptop will fix the issue the issue repeats again after hours i connected the mouse and there is no lag issue so performance is fine but the touchpad is having issues i replaced the laptop but still there is an issue in the new one as well this whole process of replacemen read more
2,i am so sorry for this tim burton must direct all of the next this was truly everything but the best episodes were from tim burton either way it was a i loved every aspect of it each director had their own vision tim burton had the best in mine i have never related to another character more than wednesday amazing casting so kudos to the casting directors thank you for bringing a show that made me binge watch all day i have not had this since stranger things that was several years ago but i just have to reiterate that tim burton must must direct all of next season happy watching yall you will not regret it
2,no but im not a small person im a size on top on bottom i dont love this on the model online but i saw this on naomis blog love taza and thought it looked amazing i tried it on in my retailer and while they only had a ml since im tall i figured thatd be fine oh no not fine its huge like it could almost cover a twin bed it was a couple inches longer on me than on the model and doesnt arc down in a drape nearly as well so just looks huuuge i thought i was bein
2,this is a beautiful springsummer dress and the quality of the materials is great i wanted to love it but the sizing is ridiculous im and and i think you could fit three of me comfortably in the xs while the pictures of the model in the dress dont suggest it has a shapeless cut it definitely looked like a sack on me a sack with a lovely print but still an illfitting sack
2,note the sleeves on the model that is how your regular size will fit your arms however even if you have skinny arms like i do the sleeves will be tight i bought my regular size xs and it was clingy with an odd flair and the length seems as though i ordered a petite and i am only ft in i advise to try a few sizes on if you really are interested the red is truly a red which is a good thing because so often it is hard to find a red that is not neon
2,i got this to use in my acer iconia w when i went to format it it only shows it as a gb i put it in one of my other computers to double check yup oddly gb fluke miss representing did i get a bad unit not going to return because packaging is gone and not interested in paying for the return it works it is fast no issues but only gb
2,we did not care for this recipe at all we found it to bland
2,weird fit and the tie just add to the problems i think id like this a lot more if it were just an open cardigan without the tie the tie seems like an after thought its flimsy and it just makes anyone wearing this look like a house no matter there size i ordered a medium black and its already in the mail
2,i love the way this dress hangs straight down on the model but on me it looked tacky im and lbs and this dress hit me in all the wrong places i got a size small sizing up would be huge in the top of the dress and the arm holes are already dangerously large i wish this were just a little bit aline instead its literally like someone just extended the length of a tshirt
2,add milk next time you bake these
2,pretty fabric nice style took it back
2,this sweater is so cute and seems high quality i would love to keep it but it is way too cropped for my taste going down just below my mid section i wish it had been cut longer i would have kept it
2,i agree with the other reviewers that this runs big unfortunately there is nothing smaller than an xs so this is going back i love the lyocell material i have another skirt with this material and wanted to love this as well but it is too big and with the drawstring pulled tight to fit it doesnt look right it is not as pictured as well the skirt i received is a medium blue denim not the lovely light blue as pictured another reason why i am returning
2,just opened it all the liquid came out all over the box lids snapped
2,worked once i was able to find a system to format itsecond card from sandisk that was sent to me unformattedthey need to get their act together
2,loved the fit and colors but the fabric is very thin and seethru i tried a nude cami underneath and the cami was completely visible it did not look appropriate for anything that i wanted to wear the top to
2,display is very bad battry only hour maximum not satisfied this product for k
2,got this at an offer price of still i feel it is not worthy worst display ive ever seen in laptops doesnt matter it is a touch screen fold laptop the display is almost useless waste of money
2,i was so excited to get this dress i need it for a wedding and i thought i had hit the jackpot the dress arrived with a small tear the seams are puckered and badly seen for an almost dress the quality is terrible i expect better from retailer im so disappointed
2,this bra runs very small and is hard to get on and off i think if i went a size up i would be happier
2,i really liked the style and fit of this shirt but im giving it a because i shirt should last longer than months ive taken it to the cleaners times and the fabric behind the tag beneath the collar has fallen apart and there are holes
2,quality is fantastic but i feel like a would have barely made its way around one leg this pant is way small in terms of sizing and not a style fit for anyone over a a lot of fabric in the legs nice pant but not for this girl
2,this is a cute top but it runs pretty big order a size down the material is like a thick gauze almost so id definitely wear a tank under
2,this dress is so cute but its going back the zipper is horrible and all of the other reviews are true youll need to size up
2,what a shame this dress is i wear xl and am but the dress in the store in the size xs looked just the right size yup xs was just the right size i cant imagine anyone who wears m or s finding this dress fit flattering it would look like a sack it is an inch or two too short in the front for me so ill be returning it
2,it hangs many a times even if you do only browsing or play youtube online
2,perhaps i have gotten too used to flowy shirts or the cut of this was not right for me but it felt too fitted around the rear end and the shoulders didnt lay right on me sizing up would have only made it too big in the shoulders so i returned i am lbs c curvymuscular frame and ordered a size small
2,i cant believe how small this thing runs beyond small its almost insulting because the dress is just so gorgeous you really want it to work but theres no way its going to when the l is actually a s so sad to return this beauty
2,i purchased this to wear on the same day it did have a strong smell i tried airing but didnt help much so didnt wear tags are cut so will probably give a try after washing by hand my fault for not checking this part it is a bit over my price range for a casual top so hoping ill end up loving it
2,it seems like a good deal but i used a whole bottle to fill the other bottles so basically we got a bottle less theyre only full so theyre much smaller than they look
2,this is a beautiful top but the xs was literally inches too wide very disappointing i am thin and tall but this was a maternity top on me i dont usually wear xxs it is much more voluminous than it appears in the picture and it is definitely gray and blue not white
2,it looks adorable in the picture but just not flattering in real life too much fabric in the skirt that flares from the waist in a bunchy unflattering way makes a slender but curvy figure look boxy rather than enhancing curves its a pass love the blue print though
2,the model must have this sweater pinned at the back the sweater color is true and the material soft as anything but the fit is at with a long torso and broad shoulders the large was still shlumpy didnt hang right at all bunches oddly and is not the least bit flattering my uber fit daughter had the same issue and she usually makes everything that doesnt work for me look amazing returned
2,i ordered the black white petite im lbs and i order petite sizes all the time the length for the size i ordered is about on the back from neckline which is great for me however the length on the sides is way too short the distance between the armpit on the blouse and the side hem is only so my skin shows on the sides all the time when wearing regular jeans not at all the way it shows on the model i would order regular length but then the sleeves will b
2,even on sale this was just too pricey for what it is which is a glorified tank i liked the straps but it hangs very wide off your chest
2,i purchased the blue s lbs b and this was very large and boxy on me not altogether unflattering but not so flattering that it justifies the price the blue color is very pretty in persondarker and slightly marled however although this sweater is certainly cashmere and very soft because of it it is very thinto the point that i consider this a top rather than a sweater the silk panel in back is pretty but again thin and unlined i think that even on sale this is ov
2,buy to offer to a baby we found that the belly mechanism does not work the baby we offered him to pretend to appreciate him for his softness and little music we cannot take back to himwe will have to order another one hoping that it will work this plush will come back very expensive
2,not a fan too salty and the gravy overpowered the taste of the veggies i wish i had found another cauliflower recipe
2,i am lbs got xs it was huge on me had to return it very trendy great quality unfortunate design not worth the money
2,favreau and co seem to put forth the most competent star wars effort by disney thus far while i enjoyed rogue one and i dont hate nor do i love the flagship disney sequels vii and viii this will likely be their adaptation i enjoy most ill be back with my reasons why at the end of the season so we shall see
2,worst laptop battery wont last for even hr and when i open it battery wont even fix by screw and thermal paste is spreaded like hazardous manner
2,i made these and they turned out way to sugary and not moist at all why two cups of sugar when you have the natural sweetness of the bananas really disappointed
2,not bad
2,season out of stars last of us season is a good series video game adaptation literally a great adaptation were the creators and writers captured moments side by side with the game great cast great with set design and music score the writers focused more on capturing the emotional drama with the characters and being faithful to the games even when they avoid the most violent part of the games the pacing is uneven the series did lack the action sequences also lacked the amount of bad guys they encounter lacking the clickers and infected they run into only one awesome episode were a horde breaks free and a climatic action sequence the series definitely avoids being over the top with the action sequences which the series could have worked better if they added more overall it is good but could have added more action sequences and infected clickers which could have build the intensity
2,the title explains it this was very entertaining i felt like the book had come to the screen there were slow parts but the same can be said for the books
2,its not bad but its nothing special at all for the first three seasons i would have given even if they were very boring but the fourth and fifth seasons really suck
2,im lbs with a f chest this dress looked like a cross between little house on the prairie and a mu mu i cant imagine this looking good on anyone who isnt tall also the straight across rather high neck line wasnt flattering to a large chest and then the arm holes are huge the fabric was a bit shiny and felt cheap it wasnt see through but it had the feel of a nightgown not a hundred dollar dress
2,looks great on the picture but when it arrived it was a great disappointment both the colors and style the material seems great quality but its stiff and scratchy the style is very boxy and as another reviewer said just hung im a brunette and the colors looked terrible on me back it goes
2,i was really looking forward to the otter and was disappointed he looks super cute but unfortunately the engine that makes the breathing so loud and annoying that i never use it it cracks right and just seems cheap also bothers me that the operation lies inside and can only be opened with velcro this is then briefly also very loud and disturbs my baby
2,bought this card for my galaxy s and after installing it and loading my music the card was randomly ejecting itself after like the rd ejection of the morning the phone reported that the card needed to be reformatted because it was damaged so i reformatted the random sdcard ejection and damaged card kept coming up after googling i read that the galaxy series phones are known to have compatibility issues with sandisk cards and its a hit or miss some phones have no issues i have replaced this card already which amazon shipped me a nd card within a few days but the same problems arise not sure if i should switch to a different brand but this card is definitely useless to me for the time being maybe i can give it away to a friend who doesnt have an s
2,processor is not good not a good choice
2,i waited for this dress to go on sale and when it did i bought it right away i am disappointed the lace fabric is very stiff i should have listened to the previous reviewer i feel like it is poking out on my arms and neck although i appreciate the careful placements of flowers on the dress had the fabric been different i think it would be a great dress
2,season is good you should go ahead and watch it the drifter loner ex military genius detective trouble magnet sarcastic funny and charismatic jack reacher was well established season i dropped it after episodes theres no real mystery the stakes are inconsistent writing is bad acting is average chemistry is sorely lacking maxes out on suspension of disbelief but more than anything its so cringe most of the time they are just sitting around and its like they are reading the dialogues of the script and since theres no well thought out subtle mystery to solve they dont actually do anything when they do have to do something its bad action sequences with dumb bad guys and lot of good guy plot armour skip season hopefully they go back to the drawing board next time
2,dont buy this dress unless you are normally a medium or larger order it one or two sizes smaller than your normal size i ordered an xs and its more like a medium or large
2,all i could taste was horseradish i followed the directions to the letter i might try again without the horseradish because they smelled so good otherwise and i think they could be without it
2,not a bad show but far from great it truly doesnt deserve the high ratings its getting the acting and directing is quite poor the dialogue is mediocre and the story is fluffy again not a bad show im watching it but im also scrolling reddit while i watch because its not a show that commands or needs your attention
2,i really loved the white lotus as a concept and enjoyed the first season a lot but this recent season was honestly the worst one ive ever seen the pacing was painfully slow and it felt like the story dragged on without building up any real tension or mystery there was nothing to really look forward to in each episode everything was too obvious predictable and lacked the intriguing ambiguity that made the earlier seasons so compelling some of the cast members felt flat or miscast which made it even harder to connect with the story overall i was very disappointed it lacked the clever writing and suspense that used to define the show i hope the next season brings back the magic
2,i was really excited to get this top in the mail unlike other reviewers i didnt find that the top fit small but i thought that the tight fit across the shoulders and chest didnt look good with the billowy torso of the top i think this top would be flattering on really thin girls but im very tall and broad shouldered so it didnt look as good on me
2,i started watching this show after hearing all the buzz around it while it doesnt really have much to do with the addams family i appreciated this show going in a new direction with this whodunit teen drama the show is more geared towards young adults but i think older viewers can still find entertainment in it because of the characters mystery and its unique sense of humor the characters are very hit or miss jenna ortega as wednesday does a great job and really anchors the series i particularly like her chemistry with her roommate enid played by emma myers the two are polar opposites them being assigned roommates makes for an entertaining dynamic that blossoms into friendship i also think the casting for the entire addams family is very good while they dont get much screen time they nail the few scenes they get fred armisen as uncle fester is a riot he serves as a pleasant surprise and good comedic relief in the later episodes some of the characters are not so great tyler and xavier are water vapor characters they are void of any charisma and dampen the scenes they are in i think the first few episodes of this series are quite good they are more lighthearted and the characters get a chance to shine before the whodunit plot really kicks in however the last few episodes kinda fall off in terms of quality in my opinion the show becomes to obsessed with plot twists and knocking the viewer off their trail that it fails to provide enough explanation for the villains motivations and the history of the towns feud with nevermore and the outcasts the amount of red herrings this script contains is obnoxious there are multiple times where wednesday is boldly and loudly wrong about her suspicions which just doesnt track with a character that is shown to be much smarter than that overall i think the show has enough good that it is worth the watch i would be interested in a season although hopefully this time around the writing is a little more cohesive
2,amd processor verry bad
2,the skiers cats and puffin patterns are adorable and i was very tempted to keep the shirts just for the patterns unfortunately the fit was awful i am short and need to highlight my waist and this shirt did the opposite the skier fabric is also seethrough the tenting issue could be fixed if you belt the shirt or tuck it in but it is not very long rayon fabric is a bummer too the shirt was snug at the bicep but not as bad as i expected from the reviews i sized up from an to
2,season was pretty good and left me looking forward to watching season the second season was a huge letdown even bringing on great actors like robert patrick and domenic lombardozzi couldnt save it from the horrible writing by the end of the season i was rooting for robert patricks character to kill reacher his entire team for being so stupid and making one tactical error after another once you got into the groove of understanding how stupid reacher and his crew were in this season it was easy to predict their next idiotic move i lost interest about halfway through the second season but forced myself to continue watching until the end they never shouldve tried to make reacher into a marvel super hero type like thor leave the bench pressing helicopters for that franchise i wont be watching season three
2,i was disappointed in this shirt the color was not the pretty blue pictured but rather a grayish blue which may look good on a brunette but not on a blonde the fabric felt like linen and wrinkled easily normally the quality of the fabric is one of my main reasons to buy holding horses but this one felt cheap the detail and craftsmanship was beautiful and i wish this shirt would have worked for me i waited for it to go on sale and was very excited to receive it holding horses is one of
2,after the first two episodes i thought no im not gonna watch any more but i did after reading a few reviews i thought maybe there is light at the end of the tunnel but after six episodes and finding out that there was a second series i couldnt bear to watch the seventh episode of the first series very slow horrible characters and sure if you got a lot of spare time on your hand maybe you give it ago but certainly not worthy viewing just doesnt seem to go anywhere
2,i wanted to love this however the fit was funky and the colors were muted this is definitely something you must try on in the store too risky to buy online due to weird fit
2,i really wanted to love this dress it is absolutely beautiful the color design and details however whether it is the high neckline or the sleeves it did nothing for me and made me look kinda frumpy though i am slender i have a chest maybe that was the problem
2,guess i shouldve looked at the pictures more closely i ordered the white version and in the pictures you cant see that the sleeves are split and it barely shows in the picture for the blue version it also wouldve helped if the detail of the sleeves were noted in the item description anyway i will be returning this top because i dont like the way the sleeves look each time i bend my arms looks a bit piratelike to me
2,this bunches up too much and the fabric is even more see through than i expected so even with a tank top under it its not a good look for work even unbuttoned at the top i could barely get this over my head this one is going back
2,even in my usual petite small size this looked bulky and made me look stumpy disappointing because the style looks so good in the picture and the material looks to be good quality i dont even know if going down a size would have helped as others have mentioned it looks like a frumpy house robe
2,i am reasonably petite but i like sweaters very oversized and large so i ordered this sweater in a large i was very disappointed when the sweater came because while the sleeves and upper chest area were in large the length of the sweater did not at all increase when the size did because the lower part of the sweater did not increase in size the sweater ended up looking very awkward with the chest and sleeves very large and long but then a very tight and short waistlength stomach i do
2,i read all the reviews and was hoping that this top would work for me but it did not i ordered a size smaller than usual and it was still way too big it was not flattering at all on my curvy frame overall it looked more like a maternity top on me then anything else if youre tall and slender i think this top would work
2,i am obsessed with this show jenna ortega kills it she is extremely talented im watching it for the th time never have i wanted to watch something over and over again cannot wait for the next season if you are needing a new show i highly recommend it especially if you like dark humor ive always loved the addams family and this focus on wednesday is the best thing ever i dont think any show will ever top this it will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time even my fiancé loves it and didnt mind rewatching it with me definitely foresee naming a future adopted puppy after her
2,i havent been impressed with disney star wars while the force awakens solo and the first two seasons of rebels were watchable everything else has been poorly written pandering and uninspired and of course tlj is its own subcategory of terrible i actually didnt even plan on watching this series my family got disney on a whim and i figured why not turns out the mandalorian is not half bad it has a lot of the same vibe as the excellent clone wars television series and unlike the sequel trilogy keeps the nostalgia catnip to a bare minimum no jedi no lightsabers precious few member berries its very nice im not going to gush just yet as of this writing there are only four episodes out and i have been burned too many times by too many tv shows to get too hyped this early but so far this actually feels like star wars in the classic sense that fun pulpy blend of john ford flash gordon and akira kurosawa its a good sign for now
2,oh what a disappointment i was looking forward to wearing this as a layering piece with the shawl cardigan the material lacks serious quality and it was ripped on the seam so back it goes and i am flabbergasted at the price retailer is charging almost for this top
2,i saw the colors and texture of this top and wanted to love it however when i put it on it just did not work the cut was so strange it runs very small in the shoulders and then flairs out so much at the waist i even ordered up a size based on reviews i ordered an when i normally where a small in things the shoulders were still too small and it was way too big every where else
2,i had high hopes for this dress but unfortunately was disappointed and returned the dress it flares out with too much material under the gathered waist its so odd
2,ill start this off by saying that im not super familiar with the source material therefore i will be judging the show on its own and a standalone piece of fiction this show is unbelievably bland and generic the protagonist is an overly edgy teenage girl whose response to everything is i will kill you and murder you ahahah who hates her mum like every other teenage girl and doesnt wanna be like her shes written like a protagonist from a self insert wattpad fanfic written by a year old girl the other characters arent exactly riveting either theyre pretty bland and generic and fit into personality archetypes there are very cringe references to pop culture along the lines of you should post on instagram snapchat and tiktok that kinda just seem to scream these kids are hip and topical but only serves to make me cringe the special effects and cgi are noticeably not great x everything looks especially fake and like it doesnt belong but i understand it has a budget of a netflix original and not an mcu movie but ive seen originals with better cgi such as umbrella academy overall it feels like this show was made to market to preteenteenage girls and is not especially riveting or engaging
2,i made this therefore i would not recommend then i made it my way instead of flour i added an extra cup of potatoes then after boiling potatoes in chicken broth removed a cup of potatoes and mashed them returned to pot added a little cream and had a deliciously thickened soup oh and i never use cheese its not needed if you season your potatoes properly
2,i was recommended to buy this by a family member who had purchased it for her kids prior to purchasing i did read some concerning reviews and was a little skeptical as its pretty pricey but wanted to give it a chance the toy is extremely soft and easy to set up to use the functions allow you to choose music a light which you can dim or brighten and breathing function we used this combo for my yr old and she would fall asleep watching it less than a month later sadly i have to return it as the belly doesnt move up and down for more than seconds its also cuts off the music and light before i even leave her room pressing the belly back in i can hear a loud clicking sound that wasnt there when initially turning it on i hope this isnt a ongoing issue as im unsure if i want to order another one
2,although this has a nice design and i wanted to love it it already looked ruined in the store with pulls all over each one i found the fit is nice but i wouldnt buy it due to the material being too delicate
2,unfortunately this sd card is not fully compatible with the samsung galaxy s i installed it and the phone would check it only to tell me sd card ready for removal this was a continuous cycle and even after formatting to fat ntfs and fat the card would not work and would revert back to exfat formati do recommend this product for those who can get it to work but my stars rating is only due to a lack of compatibility listing on the product site
2,i wanted to love this sweatshirt but alas it is going back upon opening and unfolding the first thing i noticed the dots and not solid they are sort of distressed looking with parts of them missing secondly it doesnt have a lot of structure its soft and kind of floppy but in a weird way its just not flattering on me it looks more like a pajama top than something i would wear out of the house for reference i ordered the and im usually a in tops
2,the laptop has all the specifications as it has stated what went wrong is the laptop sent to me has major issues i found within days of purchase the problems are as follows to power on the laptop you must press the button very hard when i say very hard i literally mean very hard you have to press it multiple times to power it on it has an led to show whether it is on or not the touchpad has some issues as i try to swipe toward the left it goes right it does not happen alwa read more
2,i have a similar pair of capris from retailer and when i ordered these i thought they were the same in a different color these are less flattering and i may not keep them
2,the result is exactly like a baconflavored block of cheese can not recommend
2,this shirt is thin and shapeless the quality is hm esque unflattering not a fan
2,i had fallen in love with the coral dress that was somewhat like this one and came out a few months ago but the problem im having with this one is the same problem i had with the coral one they are all flawed in their construction i had eventually tried size s in the coral because each one was flawed on one one side hung longer than the other and on all the top design did not line up with the bottom design this blue one is the same way the top design does not line up with the bot
2,season and was the best tv show on the planet season started to get political but was still good season was a big waste of time and i fast forwarded the boring parts i will not be watching season if there is one
2,oh how i love moth sweaters but wow was this one a disappointment the color is wonderful the shape is unique and the stitch work is lovely but thats where the compliments end its an itchy cheap feeling acrylic that is too short for my torso i am truly disappointed that at this price point it was such a cheap feeling piece so bummed so so bummed
2,how long can u watch a beaten dog getting beat this show is the most miserable and long winded iv ever had the displeasure of watching the acting is great but its just misery after misery so go stare at some bricks and get some joy in ya life because u will not find a single minute of it here super yawn i read the book and it seems like the writers have concentrated on one single part of a story nd dragged it out no thanks
2,followed recipe to a tee broth was very very thin i used the chicken broth to boil veggies might add some corn now when i added broth
2,i grabbed my typical size and found it fit snug in the bust the fabric has plenty of stretch so the snugness was fine especially because it meant there was no gaping along the neckline in the front its lowcut but i didnt feel particularly exposed i ended up not buying it because i dont think it fit my body right the distance between the top of the shoulder and the bottom of the arm hole was too long for me a significant portion of my bra was exposed at the bottom of the arm hole
2,i ordered these pants in my usual size xl and was shocked when i received them the waist was huge and there was nothing in the way of an elastic or tie to keep them up i couldnt keep them on so of course back they go too bad the sweater quality is great
2,this didnt work for me im normally a m got this in xs that was the correct size for me i believe however the armholes were huge husband said the top of the dress looked like the autobots symbol from transformers and he wanted me to keep it but i sent it back
2,i loved the color and design of this dress but needed to return it because it fit so poorly the arm holes are entirely too big so big that alternations couldnt fix it maybe its because i am petite but i think it may be a design flaw
2,ordered for my monthold son who struggles to sleepvery disappointed in order to be able to make the adjustments volume light movements of the belly you have to undo a scratch in the back if baby is sleeping next door he will necessarily be awakened moreover the mechanism of the movements of the belly makes a lot of noise compared to the volume of the lowest musicthe melodies are nice and soothing but really not practical and poorly thought
2,star rating with all the characters minus taylor sheridan is a star rating with taylor sheridan episodes is yellowstone seasons thru were fantastic the character development by kevin costner kelly riley cole hauser luke grimes gil birmingham and wes bentley were spectacular even other characters played by jefferson white and forrie smith were brilliant what has ruined a few episodes is taylor sheridan trying his hand at acting its awful and i have second hand embarrassment for him he of course puts himself in the position of rich famous cocky hero and it gives me the ick so fake and forced he should stick to writing and directing and leave the acting to the professionals that he puts himself in direct interaction with them like he is of the same caliber is comical he seems to be attempting the same thing in lioness and it doesnt make me want to watch it anymore
2,battery worst drain very fast
2,if you have anything larger than an a cup this shirt will likely not fit right it is very pretty but the seem on the front runs directly in the middle of the chest it literally runs right through the center of the breasts what were they thinking if it had been three inches higher or lower it would have been perfect for reference im approximately lb and have a dd cup
2,very nice otter my daughter fell asleep very well but it was broken after a quarter of a year so that the belly did not rise any more and the music was played only brieflyfor the price very disappointing
2,i ordered this and thought it would be cute for work but it tuns out the sleeves are ridiculously long i am foot and do not have short arms also it is a bit short waisted for me i do love the floral detail of the button
2,runs extremely large i got an xs and am lbs and this would have fit someone who typically wears a size and is and above very disappointed with the size the quality of the fabric wasnt great either i wanted it to work so bad but just didnt
2,i recently purchased infinix zerobook laptop from flipkart and my initial experience has been far from satisfactory maybe its cheaper from other laptop in this category but from the moment i opened the box i noticed several glaring issues that have significantly impacted my user experience firstly the laptop is surprisingly heavy which is quite inconvenient for a device that is marketed as a portable solution i am afraid to carrying it around now moreover the heating problem is read more
2,im too tall for this back goes halfway up my back cannot do much with it other than front tie fabric is not soft at all not impressed returned it
2,made exactly as set out in recipe except added one teaspoon of cinnamon to filling prep was easy and straight forward enjoyed the pie filling but did not like the crust the taste of butter was overwhelming in the future i may prepare standard scratch pie crust with this filling
2,this makes a good chowder base but using canned clams and bottled juice leaves little clam flavor use fresh salty clams and you can skip the boullion
2,was bored throughout but hoped for the best i can assume this is only for people who are rich who are trying to feel better by liking this i didnt care about any storyline or characters just hoped they would reach a demise ending was lackluster and without explanations and without demise unclear why is renewed
2,this shirt is way too flowy and the pink color is extremely washed out will definitely be returning
2,i ordered this in white and its quite sheer as others have noted it is really full and it hits at midhip which doesnt work on my figure if it had been a few inches longer and more of a tunic or less voluminous it could have worked but nope
2,chrome os is not good not supporting any software
2,processor is of very old generetion take time in processing
2,gets heat when operating on charging
2,product good but you suffer from battery issue and heating issue from the beginning of the day
2,i wanted to love this dress i ordered online and what you cannot see in the picture if the pleating on the dress i ordered a medium i am usually a large in retailer and the medium looked like a tent i realize this should be loose fitting but it was huge
2,i really enjoyed the show jenna ortega is a wonderful actress and the casting of the show overall was spot on wednesday was perfectly odd macabre in the ways we know and love despite the rather obvious storytelling beats and twist i really enjoyed what they did with it as a whole it seems like everyone had fun my one real complaint is this is not an addams family show wednesday being the focus and the rest of the family thing excluded being relagated to one or two appearances the family dynamic is very out of character which makes the whole thing feel off the addams are supposed to be full of love and support for eachother wednesday would never hate her parents or dread being like morticia also as much as i think luiz guzman was a great casting choice he didnt bring any of the charm to gomez
2,laptop is very low price and this laptop is affordable to poor familys but laptop battery backup is very bad
2,i was excited about ortega playing this role shell do it well zetajones is perfect for the role as well guzman is the worst possible choice for the role of gomez gomez addams was never a repulsively ugly and creepy character the original gomez may not have been insanely handsome but he wasnt repulsive he was debonair suave and still good looking he didnt make you cringe when he obsessively fawned over morticia this actor is just slimy creepy and repulsive for this role as far as pugsley goes i have nothing against the actor he seems fine what i have an issue with is the writing of his character being emotional and weak pugsley was never a crybaby i fully expect this to be dark and twisted after all it is burton and that is what the public craves so it should be well done i just cant bring myself to keep watching guzman in this role
2,i didnt think top was very flattering and while in the picture the mismatched hem lines in the collar looked cute in person it just looks odd this is especially true of the back of the sort where the mismatched hem repeats at the bottomjust looks missewn instead of purposeful sadly this one is going back to the store
2,should have listened a previous review while this is a very well made garment it really does remind me of a bathrobe and will be returning too bad because the fabric and stripes are really great alsothis runs very large the extra small was more like a medium
2,product is fine but i struggle to get the smooth thin lid off most of the time with wet hands impossible also the design makes it difficult to hold and pour the bottle wont buy again
2,i almost ordered this online to wear to a party later this week but im glad i waited to try it on at the store i wasnt sure if id like the length of the petite or regular better i was so disappointed and didnt end up getting either i have two bailey dresses from several years ago that are much more flattering and incredibly softcomfortable this fabric on this dress was much rougher and it really bothered me that the stripes cut off at the side seams and then dont match up from the
2,this shirt aesthetically is very pleasing i love the overall design and colors however when i tried it on i was immediately itchy the material is not soft like a cozy sweater ought to be in addition though i ordered a size medium it fit very large almost too oversized the sleeves were extremely long on me and the overall body was too big its too bad i really loved the look but im not the type to layer if you are go for it but get a size smaller than you normally would
2,now a days before purchasing take the snapshots of any offer which are applied when doing payment on flipkart if any cashback which was applied during payment and if you ask flipkart when it is not credited they will not support properly and will ask for the snapsfor the issues they will mark your issues as resolved all the times im such cases so be careful when purchasing such high value products from flipkart
2,used no salt added chicken broth did not add salt after hours meat was overdone and inedible and potatoes and onions merely okay waste of money on pork chops i will never make this recipe again salinity was fine
2,i was really excited about this dress the style looked like it would be a springsummer staple in my retailerheavy wardrobe i was really surprised when i received it in the mail the dress is quite thin cotton fabric and feels cheaply made for the price i could purchase a much higher quality dress elsewhere that would hold up better ive been an retailer fan for more than an decade but this trend of higher prices for lower quality is disappointing and insirpring me to leave a review for the f
2,i absolutely love mother jeans but i unfortunately had to return these ones this particular style seemed to run pretty small too i always size up in white jeans and even the size up that i had ordered were just too tight i typically wear a in mother and ordered a in these
2,im not really sure what the designer was trying to accomplish with this dress the fabrics and details are pretty but the shape is really strange for one thing the dress has a very straight cut so there is not a lot of room for movement and the thin belt makes the shape even worse i felt like i was wearing a really fancy garbage bag also the way the bottom flares out is just strange considering the cut and length i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it was a complete miss
2,love the silhouette and coziness of the fabric for the first few wearings i was in love then it began to pill horribly would not recommend my mother said thats going to pill up and i ignored her and she was right
2,ive never had a problem with pilcro jeans i own several pairs however i ordered my regular size im pounds and not only were these jeans thin they had zero stretch and after hour of wear stretched out horribly they fit really loose and hung around my knees and legs which is very disappointing for a skinny jean
2,this product is okay it just makes my skin feel so dry its probably just me or the product but i dont like this one
2,oh the white lotus you mean that show where rich people go on vacation to suffer from existential dread and firstworld problems under tropical sunsets the white lotus is what happens when hbo decides to give a sociology major a camera and tells them go annoy rich people for six episodesjust make it artsy its like if someone tried to make a horror movie but forgot the horror a satire but left out the sharp teeth and a murder mystery where the only real mystery is why am i still watching this the plot twists oh pleaseyou see them coming like a storm on a cloudless day the big reveals hit with the force of a deflating pool toy and lets talk about the characters its like the writers pulled them out of a privilege generatordialed to barely tolerable you spend hours with these characters hoping someoneanyonewill get their act together but nope they just spiral deeper into yoga retreats adultery and solipsistic crises its not a story arcits a souldraining loop of sunburnt narcissism and lets be honest every season is just eat the rich fanfic but written by someone who still tips and vacationed at the four seasons last month so yeahits cinematic wellacted and deep in the way a shallow pool thinks its the mariana trench but dont worry itll probably win emmys and another season where the big twist is someones feelings get hurt over brunch
2,the fabric colors and concept are fabulous but the pleating is overdone is it looks huge not swingy i am and lbs and even an xsmall was too billowy to be cute too bad its otherwise so great
2,i feel that for this price i should love this top and i wanted to however the price is on the high side for a relatively basic top and there were a few things about it that could be improved pros i ordered a medium and feel that its pretty true to size additionally the fabric is nice and light but also sheer and generally speaking has a nice pattern overall its a very pretty top cons theres a cute crisscross ruffle thing happening in the back but the model has cleverly
2,i had such high hopes but they are just slightly off they run a tad large so i suggest sizing down i usually wear a or and the fit nicely through the hips and thighs unfortunately the color is off i thought they were going to be a dark midnight blue but they are actually gray and they have a buttonfly closure which causes the pants to protrude a bit in the area where no woman wants protrusion i will be returning them
2,i tried this dress on in a and a a is a little small for me but it looked so loose and flowy i thought sizing down would be a good idea the fit in the outer layer however as the previous poster mentioned the lining is super tight i couldnt even pull the lining down over my hips the was far too big in the shoulders and arms and still too tight in the lining not sure what when wrong here but its a shame because its a really cute dress
2,good quality usually but i have a subscription and the past times it has been delivered the bottle of washing liquid has leaked everywhere and ive only had the beads and conditioner to use
2,this shirt was just really missing something for me i originally liked the patter of the small dots all over the fabric especially with the sleeves being more sheer than the rest of the blouse i also am tending to gravitate toward clothes that hide my residual baby fat in my midsection however the tie is very high up on the neck and it made me feel like i was wearing a turtleneck i rarely wear turtle necks because they make me feel like i am choking in addition the bow seemed to be too t
2,i didnt loathe the movies but i guess as only a reader of a couple of the novels i was probably not as invested as others the casting of cruise was as others say ridiculous for obvious height differences being tall was probably the only detail that childs reiterates about reacher and hollywood threw it out the window amazon to the rescue maybe this reacher casting is possibly a bit too much in the other direction though too beefy i believed reacher to be knawly rugged and deceptively strong not straight out of a la gym and whom most would never dream of picking a fight with however after shaking that off i settled down and found ritchson to be rather likeable and watchable and very much to the credit of the writers it proved that less can be so much more when it comes to dialogue i did on more than one occasion found myself laughing which is always entertaining we can all agree there was indeed a lot of cattle feed i liked the two other supporting roles a lot again no need to try to over complicate the relationships between them when reacher is a man of few words that would be too difficult to do on screen so dont bother and judge that fact fairly i think some expected complicated and intimate dialogue between the like other crime dramas nope that should not happen and would break character i binged happily over two days the best thing about it no need to skip a recap every episode and short credits amazon know most people will binge this i very much look forward to season dont can it amazon i still havent forgiven you for swamp thing
2,i really loved the colors and style of this top unfortunately it runs a bit small and was too short on me im some mentioned they didnt like fabric but i thought it was good
2,this top completely fell short for me i was so excited for it to arrive yesterday and upon opening the package i knew immediately that it was not what i was expecting in the images online there seam up the middle of the shirt isnt even noticeable but in person it is very prominentand not in a good way the peplum is a lot fuller then pictured as well did not work well with my large bust d returned
2,i loved the look of this dress online so i went to retailer to try it on in the dressing room area we were all laughing because i tried on a small when i got it tied to the point where it looked like the model online i couldnt raise my arms the distance between the cuff and the waist is inches even if you manage to lift your arms the whole dress will go with it and expose you as much as if you werent wearing a dress at all but a shirt too bad poor design for sure and such a shame when th
2,this sweatertunic is very poor quality the seams looked like they were about to come apart as soon as i got it and without a chunky statement necklace it looks like your grandmothers apron there just isnt any style to it has to go back
2,i really loved this skirt on the model but it just wasnt flattering when i received my order i ordered two sizes and i am athletic build and the front closure made my waist look much larger than it is the back of the skirt also flared out more than i expected it to sadly i had to return both perhaps this would look better on someone with a much taller frame
2,i was debating getting a large in this top but went for the medium boy is it huge the jersey fabric is quite thick which makes the sleeves bulky and uncomfortable even the small would be giant for reference i normally wear a size my chest is e and this was just so so huge it hung so badly of my chest that it looked frumpy and made me look bigger than i am the colours are true and nice and vibrant definitely size down with this one
2,product is averageevery thing is good but xcelms word not worked properlyevery time when i opened ms laptop hangedover all not recommended for office worklightmedium or heavy work
2,product arrived broken and had spilt all over the inside of the envelope
2,jenna ortega did an amazing job in her role she was perfect why they decided to cast so many brown haired white boys that look identical to one another to play so many main parts ill never understand they look so much alike its hard to follow the plot that could be forgivable if they at least had good characterization to help differentiate unfortunately we didnt get that they were all poorly written two dimensional and boring overall disappointing there were some fun moments that made it somewhat entertaining but i wouldnt rewatch it couple of good characters but they didnt get to be as central to the plot as the boring characters it really felt like the director doesnt fully grasp what makes the addams family great
2,i really love the idea behind this however the fit doesnt work for me im usually a s or xs in retailer tops and i often go with xs for sleeveless tops this one runs small though the xs was a bit too small on me based on length and width the neckline was very high higher than it looks in the model photo and the armholes were too big so i dont think sizing up would improve matters much due to the armhole issue the other criticism is that the front is not lined
2,way too much water
2,took a million attempts at getting into this i tried to watch the first episode i reckon times it was hard to understand i kept hearing good things about the series and thought if its got seasons it must be good so i finally pushed through and now im hooked it has a real sexy bad boy theme too it classy fashion high intelligence and a good level of violence to keep you engaged thereon cillian murphy and his brothers in the series are a real highlight could not think of anyone more suited for the role there is great humour and typical bluntness which gives a great laugh from ghetto gypsy so high rolling s gangsters gangster movies are not my thing but this is definitely different highly recommend
2,i love the way these jeans look and fit but they have a chemical smell i assumed the odor would go away after i washed them but it doesnt seem to have helped
2,after watching three episodes i am looking forward to the next episode setting costumes and cast are decent not a master piece but well executed except for the corporate uniform designthey just look cheap the script seems okay not many suprises storywise the characters actions seem plausible and no obvious idiotic plot developments like in obiwan not too much action in the first episodes introduction of the characters and the background of the main character mostly the music is atmospheric but not very star wars like a little generic for my taste nothing memorable that really sticks like the themes in the star wars movies or the spinoffs the typical star wars feeling did not really hit me yet as the story is located mostly on planets and describing the origin of cassians and the planet he lives on as an adult could also be located in another scifi universe there was not a single stormtrooper or empire employee to be seen anywhere from the development of the story that will probably change in the next episodes as cassian beginns his spy training the part i would criticize the most is the pacing in my opinion if the producers had just put out two episodes instead of three maybe with the second episode a little longer with less walking still scenes or drumming scenes they seemed really proud of the guy hammering the bellanvil the show would definitely profit from it and would much more enjoyable you get the feeling the producers are stretching the content to fit the length of a tv series sometimes less runtime makes for a better show in episode three the story becomes fasterpaced and more action driven in general a very solid scifi show with some star wars elements i think this one has potential and i will stick with it to see how it develops
2,i love maeve and was so excited for this top which looked like an update from a last season favorite unfortunately the fabric was stiff it was tight in the chest and went straight down from there returned
2,i saw this dress worn on the street and thought it was lovely the perfect work dress i then found it in the store and my size was already sold out so i visited another retailer and another to find it unfortunately the color blocking on the chest was not very flattering for me it seemed to overly accentuate it i am a dd size the colors the fabric are all wonderful but this dress is not for me
2,for me this looked better in the picture i found the actual item more garish in person and way too scratchy on the outside for my liking hard pass for this petite
2,this dress is really nice and lightweight the slip is snug so the outer part floats nicely butit adds a bit too much volume if you have a lot of curves it disguises in a way but also is a bit less flattering i really wanted to like it because its so breezy but a tad matronly on me
2,the cutout design of this suit looks cute on the model but didnt flatter my shape i think it would work better on someone very thin the crisscross fabric portion was a bit baggy and didnt sit right even worse the bust portion made me look flat and im a full c cup
2,according to the label this dress can be hand washed or dry cleaned i hand washed and line dried per the instructions on the label and all the seams have completely shrunk and gathered it looks like theres a drawstring running through every seam so disappointed in the quality and the labeling awful i gave it one extra star because its cute
2,maybe its my curves or the way im only but this was a hot mess on me it is soooo long and cut to low for my d chest it is slim and the cut usually is flattering but somehow this dress was anything but it is really shiny and the material is heavier than anticipated for warm weather if you are super tall and skinny with no boobs go for it had to send back
2,i have been struggling to find a nice flowy summer dress that isnt too short i am petite but do not like to wear my dresses too far above the knee so i ordered this in the regular this dress was not what i expected it is not flowy but rather a heavy and stiff fabric it is also way too wide it looks like it cant decide whether to be a box or a bag it is also shorter than advertised last thing to disappoint was the color darker and more muted than the photo on the website i cant
2,i want to be the person who lounges like the modelbut this was huge and more woolfeeling than the lightweight shawl i was hoping for i am an got the xss it was the right sizei returned it
2,pilcro stet roll ups are my fave i have about or pairs and i needed a replacement for my light wash so i went in the store and tried these on wow has the quality changed the denim is a lot lighter in material now the wash isnt as real almost like im wearing jegging shorts these were my favorite but now ill have to look for light wash denim shorts elsewhere because these new ones just wont cut it anymore why pilcro the sizing is about the same they run a little large due to the
2,i purchased this laptop and completed daysbut the very fact is this laptop is good in this budgetthey are only misleading by making false claims as in case of battery performancethe full battery doesnt even sustains for hoursvery disappointedeven the service centre are worst
2,it took days for me to get of these cards when i made the order early in the morningnormally thatll get my product to me the next evening not six days laterbe warned this was the slowest shipping ive had for my paid prime account since i started if you need these cards quickly buy from a different seller
2,i was surprised by the other reviews expected to live in this all winter but found the style bulky and awkward the hilow cut with so much bulk just wasnt flattering i wish the armholes had been larger so that the body of the shirt would have fallen closer to my body the armholes are the size of a fitted shirt which pulls the shirt wide rather than allowing it to drape a bit more it is incredibly soft but just not as comfortable as id hoped it went back
2,i have to agree that the fit is unfortunate i am using a size in retailer and most dresses i knew to size up based on reviews here i tried the size and i could barely button the top the waist fit fine and the underarms was fitted nicely to the body i sized up to a size and the dress was oversized in the top with gaping armholes too bad because the color is beautiful and the style is adorable
2,nicemust buywill add review again after month after month battery life very poor screen get black for a momentcontacted hp days before till no service provide best dont purchase
2,its pretty floaty feminine the photos dont do justice to the prettiness but the photos also dont show an asymmetrical hem i understood it runs small so i got two sizes to be safe and even my larger size was strangely shortwaisted and im shortwaisted to start with maybe i couldve lived with that but both the dresses i received have an uneven hem unlike any ive ever worn or seen before its not longer on just the sides the hem is longer in one spot on the front and one in the
2,i was excited to receive this coat for my annual travel to switzerland but hesitated to order it online without seeing it first due to the price it arrived last night with the buttons falling off and a large hole in the front pocket the lining inside is has a very cheap plasticky feel and i can also see small rips possibly forming in the lining in addition the collar on the coat is extremely bulky and the shoulders are padded underneath the fur which makes ones shoulders appear like a lineba
2,i really wanted to like this top just got it in mail today but unfortunately it did not work well for me because im ft tall and the blouse was too short i like the look and how it feels and i havent completely decided whether to return it but here are the issues i have encountered with this top the blouse is very pretty and has a nice refreshing style with good print and color very soft too unusual for rayon of this type feels more like thin delicate cotton i got my top in red size
2,unfortunately after a month and a half of use it stopped working it didnt cost little so i didnt expect it to last so little the time for the return had expired and therefore money wasted
2,while this is cozy and well made the problem lies with the unavoidable exposure of the inside of the poncho which looks unfinished had the inside been lined or had the hue of the stripes continued through the material the draped look of this piece would be gorgeous unfortunately the faded backside of the pattern a glimpse of it under models left hand viewable through the very large arm holes and impossible to hide disrupts the effortless fluid feel that a poncho should have i was
2,this blouse was so cute i really wanted to love it as others mentioned there is something wrong with the fit im not a large person but the top was tight even though i ordered a medium and a small
2,the top was very small i am usually a size small but this was tight around the top arm holes and it was short also i didnt notice if it said it was sheer see through in the description but it definitely requires another shirt underneath
2,i wanted to love this dress it looks beautiful on the model but it isnt the flattering even on sale i am not sure if it would be worth it it it runs pretty big
2,if you want to hate all the characters and all humanity for that matter this show is for you i dont see any upside either in educational or entertainment value to the white lotus ugh this show is a downer change the station you can do better
2,system loads while opening
2,i tried this dress on at my local store and was very disappointed in the slip portion of this dress there is no give with the slip so even though the dress portion is quite flowy the slip prevents anyone with a large chest or hips to wear this dress
2,i was obsessed with this top i ordered my normal and was bummed about the fit in the shoulders the slight puff was too far in it didnt hit on my shoulder so i returned it to a store and ordered a it came quickly but it was still too narrow in the shoulders i took it to the store and held it against the and the seam was the same length between the neck and shoulder as the both returned i had no hope for an
2,i ordered the blue version of this dress thinking the accent stripes were black they were not they were wine colored i liked the color but not in combination with the other colors in the dress black would have been a better look i had to take it back sad
2,i think its the best thing thats come out of star wars since the original trilogy we cant take any more of these predictable scripts that seem to be written by an artificial intelligence finally a writing that doesnt sound like fan film writing it is a realistic epic dramatic story playing on one of the most interesting themes of the saga the oppression exercised by a dictatorial regime so my main praise goes to the writing which in this franchise often unfortunately sucks we will not see the usual jedi who have now completely lost the realistic side present in the original trilogy and have redundant superpowers that look like something out of a marvel movie instead we will see realistic believable characters and a plot that is finally new one amazing thing present in this series the are real dialogue that works that is the dialogues dont just take the plot from point a to point b there are characters with personalities and the dialogues really reflect them oh and finally there is no fanservice i mean no spectacular appearances of famous characters no characters aged or rejuvenated with special effects no such crap the rest also does not disappoint nice characters very good acting and cinematography it almost seems as if someone created a real new gem instead of copying from the past and pocketing fans money
2,the shirt does have a weird yellow tinge as other reviewers have described i could get over that if the shirt was a flattering fit which it was not not worth the money so i returned it
2,im lbs and ordered an xs petite i have other dresses from maeve in xs petite and xxs petite that fit really well but this one was weirdly big at the top
2,it has not even been a month since the purchase and i have had to call lenovo support to repair the touchpad twice even though their service is good it is disturbing that the touchpad has been replaced within a month the replaced touchpad works fine
2,ram is very little clock speed only mhz windows support only one display language camera quality very poor
2,longtime ag jeans fan lately though im finding the material is much too stretchy i wanted a good pair of jeans if i wanted pajama jeans i wouldve ordered them i found the same thing with the steve capris i ordered same review there so back both pairs went its a shame because the color was as pictured and just what i wanted if only they had been made out of actual jeans material
2,thats what i look like wearing this dress a sad sad sack the fabric is less than ideal and there is no shape to speak of i love that it has pockets but thats about it there was just way too much fabric for a petite person this dress has got to be good on someone sadly that person was not me
2,i ordered this dress online the previous reviews were accurate that it runs small particularly in the waist i normally wear a or but i ordered the it fit my waist and hips but was slightly loose at the top even though i am a c i liked the look but it had a hole where the seams had come apart between the black stripe across the chest and the main fabric additionally the black squares were pulled in several places with threads sticking out i returned it immediately
2,im so bummed i absolutely loved the pair of these i bought in the bronze color great fit great color so comfortable however i just washed them and could tell right away when i laid them flat to dry that they had lost color in areas where they had wrinkled in the wash machine so now they have strange lighter lines running along them not acceptable i will say that the two lighter colors may not have this issue for reference see my stats i bought a
2,i was really hoping this dress would work because it looks adorable on the model i ordered my usual size but when i put it on the cross part in the front was way too high on my neck and was super uncomfortable i also had a lot of room in the back of the dress so it wasnt as form fitting as i would have liked i ended up returning this dress
2,what a great tv show every season we can see the same structure a new danger come thomas fight for the power of the shelby family and thomas resolve the problem at the end i think the cast helped me also to keep watched the tv show the ambience the soundtrack too it can be violent sometimes and we can see a lot of nudity but each season i wanted to watch the tv show every time even if sometimes the plot is predictable but sometimes it can surprise us a worth watching for sure
2,i ordered my usual size m and when arrived i thought the material and cut was nice once i tried it on it was way too big in hips i looked rather comical how it extended on the sides i returned the dress
2,im d this dress did nothing for me the seem on the side with the knot doesnt look right its almost on the side but not really theres a seem down the center of the butt from the waist it looks weird from the back because its such a fine striped print not flattering at all the dress is comfortable due to the stretchy knit and it has a stretchy knit lining hit me just a bit lower than on the model
2,ive been looking for a nice summer maxi dress and after reading some positive reviews i decided to get the dress the fabric is soft and has a nice flow to it however i had to return the dress because the cuff of the sleeve was too tight on my forearm which make it impossible for me to raise my arms i ordered size petite xxs
2,this open cardigan runs really big and has way too much fabric even going down a size i felt like i was swimming in it
2,worst speaker ever
2,producet very bad items
2,again bought this while wearing my retailer colored glasses i loved the flowiness and color of the dark pink and was convinced in the dressing room that this top made me look like a chic goddess midvacation on the amalfi coast i tried it on at home and it straight up looked like i was wearing a maternity top since im not with child this ones going back
2,this skirt looked absolutely beautiful in store and took my breath away i immediately headed to the fitting room to try it on but was disappointed by the awkward ruching if this skirt has removed that upper portion and kept a normal waistband thereby also shortening it to knee length it would have been lovely it should be noted that this is midilength which is awkward on me i was unable to find a cute way to wear this which is disappointing since it could have been lovely
2,i loved the look of this top online it had great lines i was so disappointed when i received it it has zero supportlining and im not large chested to need a lot its also incredibly awkward to get on and the tie in the back is only long enough to knot it making it even harder to get off it was returned
2,i love everything from retailer but this top did not fit all that flattering the neck line fits a little weird too bad color was nice though i returned the top
2,very disappointed i didnt expect from flip kart and also facing heat issue in laptop
2,i am always on the hunt for a cute white tshirt but this one was a miss it is too boxy short and the material is very thin for the price i gave it two stars because it has nice colors for springsummer for reference i am and lbs and i ordered a small bought it online so i ended up returning it to the store
2,we have tried them twice now and dont like them
2,the design and quality were great i really wanted them to fit but they ran large im and lbs and orderd the small unfortunately the fit seemed off as well and i wont be trying a size down the waist and hips were huge but the thigh area was fitted enough that a smaller size would have been awkward sadly these went back
2,i cant quite figure out what all the excitement is about this recipe it was just okay i would prefer meatballs without rice anyday and the sauce wasnt great i would far prefer spaghetti sauce or sweet and sour or mushroom or just about anything else wont make this again but glad i tried it
2,have seen every episode so far and am always left wondering what the hell im watching i was surprised to see it rated out at on here
2,im tall with a short waist and long legs and this skirt came all the way down to my ankles i would have kept it if it had stopped midcalf like in the photo im and the size fit me perfectly in the waist hip area so i would say it runs true to size the buttons lay nice and flat over the tummy so thats a plus at least you dont have to undo them to go to the bathroom
2,this style is right up my alley and i was excited to receive it however it is seriously overpriced i ordered the white and the material is thin and seethrough the small was even a bit roomy lbs dd going back unfortunately
2,i am floored by the amount of positive reviews on this dress when i received it it looked nothing like it does on the model the bottom looked like dirty sand and was completely wrinkled if you have anything above a c cup the top looks completely unflattering i looked so top heavy in this dress definitely not worth the price so disappointed
2,i guess you could call reacher a thinking persons super heroic popcorn movie intellectuals looking for cinema verité should skip i have read all the lee child books they arent great literature but child crafted a stoic iconic hero of mythological proportions in jack reacher so if you appreciate your fiction heroic and dont enjoy the nihilistic woke crap that passes for entertainment these days youre going to love this show alan ritchson is jack reacher a massive physical guy who can act pretty damn well ritchsons presence commands a room when he enters fight scenes are perfectly choreographed nasty brutal and short romantic scenes are mercifully brief as with many comic bookstyle heroic stories disbelief must be suspended to enjoy reacher the plot is fairly complex with a long list of characters so youll need to pay attention so if noir hero style action with a detective story spine is your cup of tea sit back and enjoy reacher
2,it is an entry level laptop so one cannot expect the best however there are some things i must point out battery backup is literally poor hrs in normal usage i dont know how this product is certified as military grade believe me it is a gimmick may be a mere business strategy the entire body is made of plastic and i did not feel it so sturdy that it can pass the military grade toughness scale the display has ntsc equivalent to approx srgb naturall read more
2,the colors in this dress are beautiful the greenblue version but the fabric is a very see through mesh and feels flimsy i purchased it online and wasnt expecting it to be so sheer the particular empire cut combined with the fabric makes it feel more like a nightgown i really wanted to love it but its going back
2,i really wanted to like this because the color is beautiful and the knit is obviously good quality but the shape is impossible to work with it doesnt just run big it just hangs there really disappointing itll have to go back
2,i just called sandisk and they say they have a new card version that corrects the problem sandisk sandisk tech says that the new package will show that the card is made after march dont know if that includes march but probably does and it should be corrected some older than late reportedly are ok who knowsthey even say that they will provide a free ups return labelof course you are taking a risk as to whether the problem is really fixed so keep backups i dont know what i would do
2,this top was supposed to be inches long in petite its actually inches long its also large in width hard to believe its an extra small petite
2,runs small im usually a size sm for retailer clothing for reference im lbs b the tie around the waist of this dress is not a functional tie that you can relax a bit to give yourself more room around the waist i could not fasten the buttons to close the dress on the size the size fit enough to fasten the buttons but there was a lot of extra fabric and the arm holes were very large pretty vibrant colors but size up and be warned of the large armholes
2,i loved these pants the fit well and were flattering unfortunately after three wears they came apart at the seam very disappointing and frustrating
2,dont know what these people are talking about its not even a pizza as the zucchini crust never gets crispy its a casserole
2,we already ran the slumber otter during pregnancy august after a few months you could easily hear the engine now that it is in use every evening the engine is extremely loud to hear only when the movements from the stomach stop to enjoy the musicthat is really very bad
2,i should have read the reviews with this one the sauce is too thick and so the end product isnt as creamy as id like it was too dry for the effort this took it wasnt worth it
2,this top is tight across the bust i am a dd cup and more trapezeshaped than the picture shows if you are smaller busted it may not flare out as much also the sz is what was tight and i usually wear a sz or or smallsize topblouse in the end this wasnt very flattering as it looked more like a maternity top
2,i absolutely fell in love with this dress in the store and immediately scooped it up in black wore it times on hot summer days and it was perfect very comfortable easy to throw on and dress up or down i decided to hand wash instead of dry cleaning as i usually do and after hanging dry it became significantly more translucent than it had been before i can no longer wear this dress because you can see everything through it its as though the fabric completely changed after being wet
2,i love the color of this dress it is not flattering even though it should be the weird panels of different materials makes it hang super funky the lace is heavy but the silky panels arent so not flattering its just odd and the fit is super huge you are swimming in it in addition to a poor body drape it could have been so cute but was executed so poorly
2,im lbs dd normally a p or p in pants i ordered an and probably should have gone with a it was super unflatteringthe print was overwhelming for my pale skin it made my thin waist look larger than it really was and rode up the inside of my thighs i have a similar bathing suit from modcloth thats of the price and x as flattering if you have thick legs this may not be the suit for you i returned itso fast
2,i can not say it is a bad microsd card but mine stopped working after a few months of normal useevery time i put it into my pc or smartphone a message came up saying that i needed to format it but when i click on format it showed another message saying that it was unable to format it the one i purchased to replace it is a polaroid which by the way is working better than i expectedwhile it lasted it was perfect
2,the concept of this top is cool and the outer fabric is nice the inner layer is sheer but as long as youre wearing a nudecolored bra no big deal however i did find the inner layer to be scratchy they mustve photoshopped the fit of the top on the model or altered the top because it looks like it hangs straight on her i ordered an xs and when you pull it out of the package it clearly flares out is aline so as a previous reviewer stated it looks huge from the front if it had fit the
2,i would have kept this dress if it werent for the giant arm holes and reveal my entire bra on both sides other than that it looks just like it does on the model and is a nice substantial material
2,i wanted to love this dress the cut fit and color are adorable unfortunately the fabric is super thin due to the material type it can be clingy in a manner that requires the antistatic spray your mom used to use in the s i was on the fence of keeping it but if there is so much as a wrinkle in your pantyline the whole world will see it i would hate to have to wear a slip with this due to static issue i am most likely going to return it even at off it is overpriced for the cheap
2,the print colors and fabric of this sweater are lovely the design is quirky to say the least i ordered a small as i usually do i am and weigh lbs this sweater somewhat gathers or balloons out at the hip area and is so huge that it looked like i was wearing a giant table cloth or stadium blanket it looked like i had a pillow stuffed in my backside because of how the sweater gathers up at the waist its not flattering at all
2,i love retailer and fell in love as soon as i saw this dress online being i love a quality maxi dress and this one did not disappoint however being also means the top sweater overlay hits me way short it looks ridiculous i also thought that this was very heavy for a maxi dress and could not imagine wearing it in degree weather unfortunately after waiting so long for its arrival this is going back
2,battery capacity low but all top capacity
2,i bought this product months ago for when my son was born the otter is very cute and i was excited to use it however i just started using it and it turns on and shuts off after seconds and gets stuck in the up position and wont go back down and the music turns off i really wanted to love this product it is so cute and soft but not worth the money i returned the product
2,sandisk told me i needed to send this to them to format it it will not recognize in any of my items
2,this is how the entire star wars universe should be intriguing intelligent dark plots with the side of the forces and their meanders and interests i havent seen anything like this since the ss since empire strikes back for fans of real star wars a must watch without sparing star actors showing the brutality of the thirst for power and giving meaning to the main plot of episodes iv v and vi it seems that disney has found its way again here may there be more parallel stories like this and after watching the th episode i think its the series finale i went back to watch rogue one the followup was very good
2,runs very large and way too much fabric i wanted this top to work because it looks cute on hanger i usually wear sm and the xs had too much fabric may work better on someone with longer torso and taller i am c lbs
2,im assuming the model showing the sweater is at least it is slightly cropped on her but it certainly doesnt look super cropped im and its super cropped on me even with high waist jeans also it is incredibly itchy i even tried it with a cami under but the itchy wool came right through the cami too bad its a cute design just needs some tweaking
2,slow system
2,hate i have to return it way too longalmost more mid thighalmost dress length
2,i know this is supposed to look oversized and i own a few oversized ponchos but this takes oversized to a whole new level i ordered it in my usual size and it was just waaaaay too much fabric i do not think sizing down would have made a difference if you are looking for that it seemed like good qualify
2,i saw this dress and loved everything about it i was so sad when i tried it on and it was just too big they were out of the smaller size so i had to return it the dress is well made and the color is just a bit neon compared to the picture
2,this one didnt work for me ordered this and the riverdeck tee as similar vein riverdeck was cute and flattering cut this one was boxy on me and didnt work a bit too wide so sending back
2,i thought the dress was ok but was surprised by the cut away triangles of material right under bra band on the sides of dress i will send back also a bit too high waisted for me other than that the dress is as it appears
2,this has to be one of the best netflix shows in the last months all ages can watch and enjoy i cant wait till next season actors are well casted scenes are great i would urge all to watch one episode and from there i will guarantee that you will binge in day just wish they did more than episodes hope you all enjoy as nyt said the news that tim burton would be directing half the episodes of wednesday netflixs new dramedy about the addams familys deathobsessed young daughter piqued interest it would be burtons first real television work in nearly years since he directed episodes of faerie tale theatre and alfred hitchcock presents and burton an often magical storyteller attracted to offkilter material seemed as if he might be a good match for charles addamss macabre cartoon family
2,my laptop getting slow sometimes not good product slow performance taking time for every task
2,over hitting min
2,would be flattering on someone who is slim with all the right curves im average size and a mother of the medium was not a true medium the fabric was amazing the arm holes were too openlow cut for my taste im and this landed mid calf not my preference retailer accepted the return with a hassel free refund all under weeks from receiving it
2,the sides scooped up a bit too much on me i was hoping to be able to tuck this into a skirt and wear to work but there were definitely some gaps that showed the side of my midriff back it goes
2,unfortunately the engine is quite loud and clacked and the soundnoise is not convincing either we had a different idea it doesnt look as cute as expected
2,sound quality is not good laptop sound is lowproperly not heard feeling discomfort on sound quality
2,the laptop processor is slow
2,this didnt work for me the piece looked cheap rode very highneeded to be longer the piece looks incomplete for some reason to my eyes it also does not seem quality for an retailer piece this went back
2,i bought this for my samsung galaxy s i dont know if it is my phone or the card but my phone says it was unexpectedly removed from time to time my wifes phone doesnt do it as often but still does it very fast but unreliable i have had many sandisk before and this is the only one i have had problems with i have read that there were some that were poorly made thinking i will send it back and give it another chance
2,screen resolution not good build quality poor easily broken performance okoverall considerable laptop below
2,although we only have to change the hertones without movement of the body every weeks with our nightlight with music we did not even change the batteries in months we do not use the slumber otter more often than the nightlight so you should get a good supply of batteries
2,the fabric and color are absolutely beautiful the shape of the dress is strange fitted and tight through the waist and enormous everywhere else it was not flattering
2,not say anything
2,at i guess i am just too short to pull this dress off the colors are so pretty for summer but there is just too much fabric i felt like i was wearing a giant doily however there is not a doubt in my mind that taller girls would look fabulous in this
2,this coat is beautiful in color and design we could have been great friends but it was waaay too big so i had to return it i bought the smallest size possible yet i could have been months pregnant and still would have had room to spare i also was disappointed that the sleeves were not lined like other coats in this price range
2,theres just nothing special about it it runs small and the fabric is itchy the design with button caught my eye but i didnt like it well enough to keep it
2,i made these to take to visit a sick family member and was pretty disappointed by the lack of flavor in the bars themselves they definitely need spices other then just cinnamon and i regretted not adding ground cloves ginger and nutmeg but i wanted to make the recipe exactly as shown the frosting was good but was the only flavor you could taste
2,im returning this jacket i tried it on after it was delivered and was happy with the weight cut and color although its more dusty mauve than it looks in the picture however the stitching and the zipper are of such poor quality that i doubt it will last very long i actually cant get the zipper to zip at all its very rough and lightweight and im afraid if i keep trying to force it ill just end up breaking it sorry to say yet another retailer item turns out to be poor quality thi
2,i love baseball tees and this looked like a more refined version but it was huge and shapeless nice material and fabric but this one is going back
2,havent made these due to the huge amount of cream in both filling and frosting has anyone made them with half and half in the filling
2,the dress is not the beautiful color in the pictureit is a very yellowish cream the fabric is thick and does not hang pretty very disappointed had to return it
2,i really liked the look of the orange so ordered an xs i prefer a s petite but it is sold out the xs arrives and while i still like the color the fit is really weird the cowl is very high up but the sleeves are still long it looks nothing like the photo i cannot see how the cowl sits on the models collar bone despite eliding the color the design is off so have to return
2,the fabric is too sheer also looks like sleepwear just not my thing
2,ive been wearing this very comfortable and cute coat for weeks it is already tearing at the seams somehow the quality of this is very poor
2,i bought this in size xl it ran much shorter smaller than is typical for this brand i found the arms tighter on me compared to the models photos the lace itself was pretty intricate and washed well i wish this shirt had worked but i ended up donating it after wearing it a couple times the cropped length and closefit just didnt work on me i thought the sleeve shape was pretty with just a little more material this would have been a favorite i hope it works well on whoever receives i
2,very sweet and fluffy otter my daughter likes to cuddle with it the mechanics while breathing is simply mega loud and its tangled all the time relaxed falling asleep cant be called that
2,disappointment city with this one and i am so lucky i had a coupon because if i would have paid the full they are asking i would be a tad skewed not just thin material but thin and cheap feeling doesnt itch but i seriously expected a lot more from retailer i have noted the name of the designer and have promised myself to never buy this label again big loser
2,its my review after days of usage tha worst part in tha devide was the speakersnot only tha audio was irritating tha speaking continuously making some noice while listing a song or watching a video the touch pad was sometimes not working properly even sometimes tha lap was not properly turning on and needs to be switch off with tha power button and repeating this for multiple times my personal opinion was specs seems to be good but tha quality of the components like touch pad and spea read more
2,i splurged on this top and was sadly disappointed im a d and the l was so tight i couldnt get it over my chest also the arms were super tight and the length is nearly cropped and the fabric is shiny the picture makes it look like its matte if it did fit like the model i wouldve loved it the print is beautiful though bummer
2,very greasy would not be making it again
2,laptop is very lagging is not provided good performance just waste the money
2,this item is pretty the print on the fabric is nice and reminiscent of embroidery but only the top portion has a few embroidered accents my issue with it is its very impractical the fabric is extremely thin and you wouldnt want to wear it in any weather below degrees its ridiculous to advertise this product for a fallwinter season the tube top underneath doesnt work very hard to stay up and isnt a very practical way to hold up the jumpsuit why wouldnt they just stitch a lining
2,bought this camitank on sale which im glad but it has a flap underneath like a bralette but not fittedit kinda just drapes under the camithe problem is its not thick enough to offer the coverage you would want under a white tank but it was also too short so it caused a visible line underneath that showed throughthat was higher than the bottom of my chest so it gave the appearance that i wore the wrong braundergarmentit simply looks awkward not sure if it wouldve been better
2,okay
2,im not getting this at all i watched the first season thought it was a bit of fun mediocre but fun i remember thinking this is something they could build on then the second season was worse not sure about the third i heard spielberg not only liked the second season but watched it twice guess im the fool i did like the idea i guess thats why i felt the first season could be built upon the exotic seclusion the chance to be something else or become something else the journey of that some of the stuff with the characters made me think this could go somewhere nope maybe i should open my mind to season and see if i was wrong
2,bought a large could barely pull up over my butt runs extremely small its cute but if your not a stick figure this is not the suit for you
2,this top couldve been one of my favorites ever i ordered the rose option and was planning on ordering another color the fabric is super thin but i was able to wear wo an extra tank unfortunately after wears several small holes appeared around the neckunder the ruffle i washed this top on hand wash cycle and hung to dry when i came to read the reviews i noticed i wasnt the only customer with this issue
2,im pretty disappointed with this recipe ive made this in the past and it always turned out great this recipe changed things up a bit from what im used to and i figured it would be interesting to try something new the strawberries in syrup was a bad choice mixing them with the jello just made it way too watery i was supposed to bring it to work today for a potluck but instead its still sitting in my fridge because the jello layer is still soup next time either do regular frozen berries or fresh skip the syrup also i agree with some reviewers that the cream cheese layer is too thin definitely browse around to find other variations of this recipe before moving forward
2,i ordered these a size up because id just had a baby and knew i needed a bigger size my prepre baby size chubby phase were size these fit like a size way too small very disappointed
2,i saw this on a mannequin in the store and so wanted it to work but was just too oversized and bulky very good quality and material
2,it doesnt smell good and doesnt last for a long time had to order another product
2,in peaky blinders we follow a family after the first world war that is always looking for power and money but a policeman arriving at the city is looking to stop this family but its not easy it will also be noticeable the segregated fight of ghettos like italians gypsies local gangsters and jews peaky blinders is an excellent gangster drama full of rich interesting and diverse characters the fact that peaky blinders is a crime series can give the impression that characters are macho men but this is not true the series also incorporates many powerful female characters it has an excellent cast and script thomas is a character who uses his strategic intelligence and applies violence to his own ends without hesitation the film music is the highlight of the series along with cillian murphy and tom hardy the director does resort to a modern soundtrack that reflects the fiction it is estimated that one episode of the series is worth million and million euros this means a rich detailed and beautiful work of art constantly supporting the narrative structure visually peaky blinders often touches upon the working conditions of the working class in birmingham peaky blinders with a color scale that chooses to contrast between pale blues and greens and contrasts with the shades of red makes the strongest manifestation of emotions in the midst of this unknown while attributing a distinct obscurity to birminghams misty air also the visual effects used from time to time are quite clever the visual effects used are also quite compatible with the historical theme of the series peaky blinders makes each episode a separate action and drama its a breathtaking series where you can see the rise of peaky blinders
2,battery performance is pretty bad hardly coming hrs and audio sound quality not good
2,literally every single person in this show is unlikeable and theres not a single character in the entire cast to root for or identify with its supposed to be a comedy but theres little evidence of that its supposed to be a drama but there are no stakes all were left with is some random horrible people who dont say anything funny dont do anything impactful and hang out by the beach id be fine with it if there were jokes or funny situations id be fine with it if there was compelling drama id even be fine with it if there was anyone to root for feel for or identify with but theres none of that here
2,this is called class so i ordered it figuring it would have useable speed i plugged it in to copy about gb of program installation files i was totally dumbfounded that it took about hours to copy those files onto this ultra class sdxc card gb on my superslow supercheap plastic schoolkid usb thumb drive takes less than minutes so then i tested it on various known computers with typical raw and jpg picture files read speeds ranged from mbs while write speeds ranged from mbsec for big files and below mbsec for small files this is what i would call largely unusable very disappointing
2,i used brown sugar and reduced it to cup based on other peoples reviews i used frozen thighs and they took hours to cook i have a baked chicken recipe that i like better and will use in the future
2,my usual size was a bit large and baggy in most areas but the bust was sooo soo small the button popped and i had barely moved do not recommend this one for anyone with a bust the detailing is very pretty though for someone that can make this work
2,not good at all youll face lagging issue all the time go for laptop having graphics card dont go on look and fingerprint
2,this wasnt terrible but wasnt good it is greatly lacking in flavor i would add more celery carrots parsley onion salt and pepper it needs a lot of help stars
2,as i wrote in the title those two deserve emmys jennifer got hers and im thrilled im a little peeved that murray didnt get one because he was the glue that held it all together this show couldnt decide whether it was a comedy or drama and wasnt written to include either in an intelligent way i found myself bored through most of it and by the last two episodes i was fastforwarding to the characters i did manage to care about like many people who wrote they ended this show by scratching their heads as in what did i just watch i was no different one thing i do know i wont watch season two since murray wont be included he is a huge talent who should be more famous than he is given his time in the business onward and upward mr bartlett
2,this show is truly amazing yep its everything people say indeed and people are saying that season is wasting our time i think that the season started well and had a good plot everything seemed to be heading towards something but plah something happens and we get back to square one and seeing our hero starting over almost from scratch was disappoiting i dont agree that its boring but this terrible plot twist is definetely disappoiting i hope the producers respet our engagement to the show and put it back on track yet we are on episode and still the same
2,incredibly well made show top to bottom every character has their own complex personalities and layers throughout each one masterfully performed to the absolute highest degree every single scene in peaky blinders is crafted to be as good as possible thanks to the incredible writing and direction of steven knight of course the main stars of the show are the cast thomas shelby portrayed by the extraordinary cillian murphy has to be one of if not the best protagonist i have ever seen for a tv show cillian murphy truly puts on a performance of a lifetime as tommy shelby a performance so well i truly cannot do it justice by writing this review not to mention the other allstar performances of the rest of the cast paul anderson as arthur shelby helen mccroy rip as polly grey sophie rundle as ada and tom hardy as alfie solomons one of my favorite characters second to tommy shelby himself the cinematography and set pieces aswell are by far the best i have ever seen in any show by a country mile peaky blinders truly is a masterful show written and acted to absolute perfection should be considered as a top show of all time by everybody who loves television
2,i love how these jeans look on tts adorable i exchanged my first pair due to stitching coming out in the back right pocket pair the stitching came out in the exact same place this seems to be a problem with the qualitysewing the fact that the stitching is gold and decorative as well as functional means it will keep unraveling until the jeans are ruined nd pair has to go back too bad
2,it was disjointed slow redundant and most of all boring tanya was dumb to the extreme and it was hard to feel any sympathy for her portia as a modern woman was more than naive interestingly most of the characters seemed incredibly naive unbelievable the one character who could be forgiven was poor inexperienced albie who ended up learning a valuable life lesson hopefully he will be better equipped to recognize portias indecisive loyalties the ending was unsatisfying and seemed too rushed to tie up all the lose ends ill be surprised if there is a season if there is it will need to have an amazing first two episodes to redeem season
2,rough item
2,this is a problem i have had with the pilcro hyphen cargos with the color dye the dyes in these pants are the same thing i wore the purple color and washed in cold gentle cycle and they were stained i will return these its too bad because they were pretty comfortable and flattering pants
2,its not good to handle because the electronic element must be very well hidden in the plush because small children should not be able to open thisthe abbreviation operation sometimes stops after a few seconds and has to be restartedthis interrupts the sleepin slumber status of the childsupplement on after only months the part has given up the mindsad and very shameful since it was given away to the granddaughter at that time now months
2,if you are going for a ridiculously high priced ugly sweater contest this is the one for you i normally like clothing with some character and juxtaposition but this one did not do it for me i cannot imagine the collar fitting right or flattering anyone and the mixed layers end up making it look cheap rather than trendy
2,im feet and hourglass figure i literally burst out laughing when i opened the package i ordered my usual small petite the dress is so short and small you would have to be feet pounds returning
2,the colour is fine however this year the smell is strong there is some annoying glitter effect which might be nice on the beach but less so in the office and it leaves brown marks on my white towels when i dry myself
2,this top was much more fitted than expected and was not flattering i would not recommend
2,i would have loved this top if it were the length pictured on the model but it was a cropped length on me
2,i was so curious to see this skirt it looks just like pic really gorgeous bold pattern and a faux suede like fabric my only problem was that i thought there was too much fabric i love maxi skirts i am quot and lbs it was a bit long on me but just had too much fabric i have slim hips but this made them look larger skirt is almost ballroom gown like in its fullness loved it and someone else might love it but for me it was too much wish it worked
2,i loved how this looked on the model however once i tried on in store i was greatly disappointed i usually wear a meduim and the small and extrasmall were huge on me there was so much extra material that i was swimming in this i had such high hopes for this there were no petite sizes to try on in the store but i am not sure it would have helped
2,girlfriend wasnt too pleased but still said are ok
2,this dress did not work well on my figure i have a small waist and broad hips and the dress size m for lbs was too boxy i didnt have objections to the fabric like other reviewers honestly even if there were a snag or two the fabric is kind of rustic and i dont think a snag would look terrible depending on where it is i should note that one of the ornamental buttons immediately fell off the dress upon arrival my friend got the same dress in a size s and it worked better f
2,was excited to receive this dress as it had some great reviews however of the love was coming from the set as a petite this didnt work well for me and the fabric flattened me out in the bust in an awkward way returned
2,the colors are so much brighter than pictured although the sweater is very comfortable i did not like the color combination i will be returning it
2,this is a really nice quality dress it is a lowcut vneck but the fabric is form fitting so its not revealing when u move i love the top part of the dress but the skirt just did nothing for me its a soft material but the skirt almost resembles a bath towel in look and feel i am petite in size lbs i will be returning due to the skirt being to loose on me in width rather than length also the center pleat of the skirt makes it look a bit odd the skirt hit right at knee height
2,and not in a good way everywhere i went i left a little of this sweater behind within hours of having it on i was picking balls of fabric off the couch bed and the sweater itself looked like it was molting great style fabric and fit although a little on the long side but theres no way i can keep it
2,great acting and script highly recommend hbo at its best
2,the biggest problem of got towards the end was the lack of any source material and it wasnt something that had any solution so dd cant be really blamed however writers of witcher do have the finished saga in their hands and they choose to ignore it while the first season roughly corresponded with the witcher short stories much appreciated no one has ever got that right the second season is basically going its own way and it sucks so for s for s thats in average but it will go down with every new season
2,finally received this in the mail today and was very disappointed i am swimming in the xs lbs the colors are much more vibrant that shown in the pics the green is a bright kelly green the red is much more red than rust colored etc and its a sweater coat for the price i was expecting it to be lined and higher quality i dont doubt that it will be warm but cant justify the price its going back to the store
2,usually an retailer dress in a large fits me perfectly however not this one i am larger busted and this dress was way too tight on top possibly better on smaller chests the dress is cute and the rest of the fit was good not for me could barely pull it down over the boobs going back
2,laptop is functioning perfectly but cursor point right click is not functioning properly
2,this is the nd time ive purchased a dolan top and returned it bc it was dry clean only both tops were what i consider to be casual tops to be worn with a pair of jeans running errands etc i do not dry clean this kind of casual shirt it is made out of rayon and thats the problem i think i purchased this in the wine color and it is a lovely color hangs nicely doesnt cling the sleeves are a bit long but i could live with that i just pushed them up as a turtleneck it was a bit l
2,this top is really cute but the threads underneath the shirt scratch your torso i suggest wearing a tank underneath to protect your skin
2,a beautiful shawl but not practical i was impressed with how elegantromantic it first feltlooked however after minutes of wear it would not stay on my shoulders the design is very awkward and despite several attempts with different topstanks underneath i kept running into the same problem lovely for the first minutes of wear and then awkwardlyannoyingly wouldnt stay on my shoulders the neckline is undefined and it just fell off not a great design disappointedly returned it
2,the product looked more or less as expected but the fabric felt very cheap not the quality i would expect from retailer the shirt is also very short which did not bother me but is something others should be aware of
2,i put on this tshirt and my husband said it makes you look old he was right im not sure if its the cut or the pattern but i found it completely unflattering on my petite frame and it looked cheap too perhaps on someone else it would look different the pattern is overwhelming and the sleeps are a bit too look and ruched for my liking it may look better on someone taller
2,love the idea of this top but it is so thin and the sequins look so cheap the quality reminds me of something you would buy for at a market abroad definitely disappointed with the quality for the price will be retuning
2,the first episode barely held my i interest introducing characters that you want to avoid whenever your on holiday appear in this six part series white lotus comes across like a mediocre broadcast tv show thats needed for cancellation will see if i can sit through another episode
2,as a beach coverup this would be great but im surprised retailer calls this a dress and doesnt show on the model how thin it is its pretty sheer and i couldnt get away without layering it
2,just not cute i dont know how else to describe this top i am a dd and ordered a large it fit and was comfortable but the peplum had way too much fabric it actually made me look much bigger than i am i would possibly have tried a medium but it wasnt in store so i returned
2,i bought this top in the store which was good because i ended up wearing a size smaller than i usually do i loved the flowy fit of it the washing instructions say machine wash cold tumble dry low i washed it on cold and hung it to dry it shrank to the point of being unwearable the dreaded button gap and lost its softness i hope the store lets me return it
2,very bad product waste of money
2,i got this sweater with high hopes to wear it with some leggings for christmas it looked adorable and long on the model however it doesnt even cover my butt thats how short it is if youre anything over id say itll be too short for leggings
2,i bought gb version of the card to use with gopro hero black edition it didnt work out the card worked ok if camera was set to resolution with lower bit rates eg worked fine in p with protune on or p with protune off however in p with protune on bitrate is just shy of mbs in this mode much higher then with protune turned off it was nothing but trouble camera would sometime work and sometime randomly stop recording for no obvious reason i first suspected camera but testing with different sd cards it ended up being sandisks card that was at fault my spare card an old and cheap gb pny also class worked just fine under same conditions and with same camera settingsonce it was obvious it was problem with the card i found people on gopros forums that had trouble with this specific card as well well you always find these only after you figure it out for yourself right anyhow i did some speed tests with the card by doing simple write of gb file full of zeros using unix dd utility to copy gb of zeros from devzero where else would you find that many zeros onto a file on the card the result was that on average sandisks card would manage about mbs just barely above the bar for class card however that was average over gb during the write test the speed was oscillating with many spikes and drops drops were as low as mbs uh i thought write speed of class card should never dip below mbs for comparison my old cheap class pny card was chugging along at constant mbs under the same test no spikes and no drops in speedthe card will probably work fine in most devices as bitrates when recording p video are often low enough andor camera might have huge buffer but if you want to use it to record video at high bitrates and your device doesnt have huge buffer to compensate for speed bumps of this card you may run into trouble be wary of using it in hero in modes that have higher bit rates eg p with protune enabledsandisks website lists part numbers as sdsdquig with adapter and sdsdquag without adapter this conflicts with product description on amazon while this is likely just amazon not getting product description right again a bit too common thing its interesting to noteupdate apr some numbers from testing the card the test is extremely simple write out gb of zeros onto the card using standard unix dd command to read kb blocks of zeroes from special device devzero and write it onto the card kb gb dd displays transfer stats once it finishes while dd was running i run iostat in second terminal displaying second interval stats as a measure of current speed this was done on the mac dd command line can be used asis to repeat test on linux system however iostat command is different on linux and would need to be modified slightly i choose kb block size as that seems to be what device drivers merges sequential writes into anyhow using different block sizes results are comparable dd ifdevzero oftest bs count records in records out bytes transferred in secs bytessecso mbs and all is good right wrong iostat running in parallel with above dd command recorded this iostat d w diskdiskkbt tps mbs and so on until dd finishes writing gb of zeros to the card imo the last column should never dip under mbs for card labeled classfor comparison same test run against samsung pro gb microsd card dd ifdevzero oftest bs count records in records out bytes transferred in secs bytessec iostat d w diskdiskkbt tps mbs and so on until dd finishes writing gb of zeros to the card so samsung is on average x faster but more importantly its speed is much more constant and critically important it never dips under mbs
2,the design of this sweater is odd it made me feel very round when i put it on the sleeves were wide the other reviewers were correct in saying that its a thick sweater which i thought id like the torso was slimmer and longer than i expected it really was the odd design of the sleeves that made me not like this sweater
2,review title says almost all add to that that it is age appropriate unlike other kedia dresses for the very young just too cute for words i have all of the other tk peasant dresses and although youthful they are appropriate for anyone young of heart this however on an older woman looks ridiculous i would have liked it for those months but even then it would cover quadruplets
2,fun sexy underwear but rides up in the front will return
2,i purchased the dress with the bowback shift in peach because i loved its nautical theme pattern when i recurve do the dress i found it to be stiff and boxy being a petite shortwaisted person the top portion of the stress hung on my body awkwardly my bra strap was showing in the back and the dress needed to be pulled up about inches to properly sit on my frame i returned the dress
2,i ordered this dress expecting a cool lightweight summer dress i believe it says cotton in the descriptionhowever the material is a very heavy cottonlinen blendwould have much preferred a better quality fabricthe color is a nice green and is well madeit runs large except in the bust which fit well
2,the handmaids tale is a brutal emotionally charged show that left a lasting impact on me its especially harrowing for women portraying a dystopia that feels terrifyingly real watching it brought out a whirlwind of emotions anger sorrow fear and hope the performances are so powerful i could truly feel what the characters felt every scene is raw and hauntingly beautiful for me its more than just a show its a masterpiece that challenges provokes and stays with you long after the screen goes dark a mustwatch for its depth power and unforgettable storytelling the direction cinematography and writing are all toptier drawing you deep into its world its rare to see a series so emotionally immersive and thoughtprovoking
2,quality piece except the fit is way off i have a c bust and long narrow torso larger on the bottom i ordered the small i frequently wear a smallextra small on top and i was busting out of this in the chest area however the fit then flares way out from the torso and it just looked dumpy and overpowered my foot frame i marked it as running small which it does on top but then it runs very large on bottom wanted it to work but didnt
2,tasted okay my family liked but next time no thyme
2,i bought lenovo loq intel core i th gen hx came after days despite full payment battery drains really fast even when you are surfing only hrs to hrs backup that too only after light work attached are benchmark scores little low score compared to online reported results my laptop is working fine so far although lots of reviews online at other websites reporting issues with motherboard and display read those reviews before making a call i bought third party warrant read more
2,this sweater is thick and does cover the bra well i did not find it to be well made the ribbing seemed to be attached loosely in places i am a size large with a b cup and a bit thicker through the middle to my middle age dismay putting this sweater on in coral made me feel like a giant peach for those with larger breasts it is likely more flattering
2,sorry i wasted good ingredients on this recipe
2,i ordered this dress online the colors are pretty if you like pastels and the fit is true to size however it fits very much like a maternity dress for those of you rocking a baby bump this is a good choice for others who are not its just not flattering my figure got lost in the dress and the high waist did not look good on me i returned it
2,material is thin with a fleece like feeling on the inside hard to describe but almost feels like a really thin north face material the cut on the sides of chest area is super awkward shows way too much would never be appropriate to wear a regular bra underneath
2,not chargeing at all
2,windows not installed
2,i bought this to use as expanded storage in my asus transformer book t but it was unstable and i have had to return it although the tablet would see the card when it was first inserted there would be errors trying to copy files onto it and then windows would indicate that it needed formatting if i tried a quick format then everything seemed to be ok but the instability would return as soon as i tried to copy data to the card if i tried a full format it always failedi gave it two starts because it seemed to work using the supplied sd adapter in a windows laptop i was able to do a full format on that but when i put it back into the tablet the problems continued the tablet is compatible with sdxc cards and when i tried a different micro sd card in the tablet it worked fine so i assume it was a problem with this card
2,it was simple and plain in my opinion it tasted like a vanilla wafer cookie with cherry pie filling spread on it its so sweet you can eat it without the icing sorry to say i dont think i will be making this one again i would give it one star but my son said it should be a least two stars due to the sweetness factor
2,im upset i ordered the grey sweatshirt and while the description says the sweatshirt has a zipper the picture of the grey does not have a zipper i prefer no zipper so when it arrived in the mail with a zipper i was disappointed its going back why have a model where an item that youre not offering
2,the dress has a partially sewnin slip which really didnt work for me no matter how much adjusting i did i couldnt get the slip and dress to sit properly i ordered a medium and if it hadnt been for the slip the fit would have been good the length was as pictured for reference i am lbs ddd
2,i gave a lot of leeway to the show when i watched the first two episodes but after having watched them all i can honestly sayits very basic teen drama with some magical creatures a lot of the dialogue makes you cringe because years old people tried to copy teenager language of today constantly the cgi looks low budget i have seen better in movies from years ago you can see the plot twists coming like a street sign telling you where the story will go in five episodes there was a minutes episode of the fairly oddparents that basically had the same plot but we have an episode season here folks almost an hour per episode how yes it probably is for a younger audience yes it may be for teenage girls who want to feel special because they are just like wednesday but i honestly expected more than that especially because tim burton participated
2,its nice material but the design makes you look like a pregnant lady
2,its genuinely well made and written if you like star wars you will enjoy this
2,in a word clingy and not in good way long so you need it to flow not cling liked the back but front was just too clingy back it goes
2,wore it a couple of times it is cool and comfortable washed it and the raw edges are starting to fray i might get one or two more wears out of it hand washed and hung dry
2,bad finishing
2,i think i got or months out of this before it started to fail it is still working intermittently but my phone will suddenly stop being able to read it for no apparent reason designed for durability my foot it might survive in salt water but it didnt survive in a phone that frankly doesnt get a whole lot of use this is the first sandisk product ive ever had fail on me it may still be under warranty but i dont care now that i have to replace it im going to go with another brand
2,loved the sweater and the sale price was great but i could not take the shedding even after just trying it on the first time my jeans and top had shedding all over them this was minutes i could not imagine what i would look like if i wore it all day had to return
2,display is below average they used tn panel which will definitely disappoint you cant see from side angles and picture quality will be low battery is ok will get hours around performance is good
2,we did not like the pretzel crust way too salty for a desert
2,this top is beautifully made and designed material is soft and comfortable however its very boxy the details on the side stick out i just found it not very flattering for me
2,if youre looking for a realistic show this is not your show if you can suspend reality then youll overcome the biggest hurdle i had the premise of the story is decent on the whole the acting is solid the performance by willa fitzgerald roscoe as the female lead was the most refreshing female lead ive seen in a long time as she mostly behaved like a normal human being disappointingly the performance of maria sten neagley was cringeworthy fitzgerald played modestly relatable confident and strong in that she stood by her conviction without being a d ninja warrior alan ritchson reacher played the role as charming arrogant and highly confident it was a fine line between likeable and not had netflix made this series reacher would have ticked a box of some sort in this series you felt that box ticking was not important mind you one of the black characters was poorly done without any spoilers they were totally shallow i would have preferred more nuance the real problem with the series is the lack of logic people are being murdered everywhere by professionals crack shots and psychos however they never seem to be able to kill the three lead characters this made no sense the series is best summarised as follows the series avoids woke tropes reacher is not emasculated in any way the acting is decent mostly however the logic sometimes fails dont look too hard and you have a good series it was mostly great
2,tastes like eating melted plastic thanks to the velveeta next time i would use real cheddar and it might edible then
2,stops often when he has weight on it
2,entertaining and relaxing to watch some beautiful music and scenes every episode its nice with a well scripted thought out story and actors who pull it off great all except jennifer coolidge are great i just dont get why she is even in it all other characters stories get mixed between each other and she is just out on the side being cringy and annoying and i guess you can say thats the role she was given but i feel like thats all she ever is and i have absolutely no idea why they would bring her back for season as the only one hope for a season with complete new cast and a new location obviously
2,display is too worst battery is just ok we can use normally but not for gaming or coding overall ok but camera quality was too bad
2,i bought these last year and loved them however they came in tall sizes this year they do not and the inseam is just way too short even at im and they barely graze the floor with no break in the pant leg i prefer to wear them with boots and they will not be long enough even with a short heal
2,my husband used this deoderant and found on application was very uncomfortable under arms with a stinging sensation for quite some while after use
2,i liked the design and the shirt did fit well enough but the thin fabric does not justify the price it looks like it will get holes in it after a wash or two
2,it must be the weak script and poor directing that can make reliably good actors like connie britton and steve zahn seem so uninteresting this is neither funny comedy nor exciting drama but something blah far away from both the murray bartlett character is catatonic and the idea of sitting through six episodes with jennifer coolidge is uh not appealing the newlyweds are pathetic cant believe this was hailed as mustsee tv you dont have to wonder whether tv reviewers are paid off but how much
2,i dont get the handmaiden concept she obviously doesnt enjoy being a slave then why does she do it i obviously dont enjoy this show i just watched first episodes to see if a solid reason is actually presented as to why she is taking any of this but no she is just scared all time broken living in the past a truly living shadow it is my strong opinion that no life is this important certainly not this handmaidens life free people will not accept just living without any of their basic freedoms there are nuances here but the protagonist here is the ultimate slave on the bottom of the freedom chain people will just go down fighting or if this is not an option will just kill themselves rather than living a nolife wherever the slavery happens it is by choice some people enjoy being slaves or for religious reasons meaning they really have higher values that surpass their freedoms never to a free society and never with the gun so you see why i have a hard time to accept this concept more to enjoy it it is not my intention to pick at another overrated show or a political statement a philosophic outburst or whatever this is i just dont get the concept fear is no longer such a strong motivator to make anything like this happen you dont believe it just try it for real and see what happens we all die eventually anyway so what big cards do you think you have to bluff like that
2,i agree with the previous reviewer that the length is not at all what is shown in the picture much shorter than that and while the overall detail of the skirt is very nice the elastic waistband makes it look cheap considering the price
2,i was really hopeful that this top would work on me because it is so cute online however i was very disappointed when i finally received it the sleeves look soft and snuggy in the picture but are actually a bit stiff and scratchy in person i could almost get over the sleeves but the white part of the shirt was horrible i am and a size i wear a size small at retailer and i got a small in this top the bottom of the shirt was a tad short on me and hit just below my belt line which i
2,i love the product despite that fact that the box had only whereas package says
2,the texture was soggy the taste was bland the sauce only added more sweet to a really sweet cake and then throw in the fat and butter and there was nothing to find tasty
2,additional sugar raw is not an ingredient one can act on recipe does not say how much sugar and the multiple adds for print recipes is so annoying by accident i clicked on it and then had to spend time to take it out i just signed up for this site as i saw the recipe on my flipboard page but due to the navigation around ad challenges and inability to get accurate recipe ingredients i am seriously considering deleting my account frustration is not a customer service plus
2,i usually buy the mr muscle one ill go back to doing so
2,like another reviewer mentioned this shirt is way too short im only xs and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model also the quality isnt great as its very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front its a shame bc the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique sadly its going back
2,i was close to boycotting this show altogether i mean what on earth is this release schedule an addams family series directed by tim burton no less that gets released well after halloween i understand perfectly if the show wasnt completed yet lord knows ive roasted a fair number of straighttostreaming shows for seeming to have been released on a strict schedule rather than whenever its ready or if the creators wanted the image of a pilgrim statue set ablaze to better coincide with thanksgiving still releasing something like this in november just feels wrong wednesday is often enjoyable albeit not as distinctly creepy and kooky as it couldve been many of the actors sans jenna ortega are unremarkable and it doesnt help that the show often feels more like the umbrella academy or some cw superhero show than the addams family could burton not decide between an addams adaptation and a miss peregrine spinoff so he did both ive also seen some complaints re luis guzmán as gomez from longtime fans claiming that hes completely wrong for what the role is supposed to be i already pointed this out in my review of s addams family reboot but if you gomez addams fans out there are perturbed that he isnt tall or handsome anymore then youre not actually fans of gomez addams but rather the raul juliajohn astin variation that is decidedly less faithful to the charles addams comics than this is thats a good gomez too but if youre gonna come at this new show with purist pretenses i just want you to keep straight what the original is
2,the cut of the bodice is very strange and unflattering it is great quality but designed poorly returned it
2,i love this top so cute and comfy but i wore it twice washed it once on gentle and layed to drynow there are small holes in the front for as much as it cost i would have expected it to be more durable very disappointing especially since i dont live near an retailer and cant take it back easily
2,i served this for th of july yesterday i thought id like it better than i did it made a lot which was a plus but it was really missing something in the flavor i found it unappealing and wished id served something else inhad people for dinner people ate it i had half a bowl left over my husband said it was okay and that he liked it well enough but i didnt notice anyone really excited about it too bad it sounded like something id likeperhaps id like it with a different dressing i think the dressing was a deal breaker for me maybe ill try it again but use a favorite coleslaw dressing on it instead also i wasnt crazy about the chestnuts if i do it again ill use chopped jicama instead
2,im a fan of yumi kim dresses and consistently wear size small so i ordered this in a small and the top was a little loose but it was way too short theres no way i would feel comfortable wearing this in public im and the hem was higher than midthigh on me the waist is also billowy and has no defined shape
2,this nightgown looked so comfy and cute i ordered a large and it was so uncomfortably tightim and lbs it was such a shame size large should not just be really a medium
2,the last of us tv series emerges not just as an adaptation but as a masterclass in storytelling that transcends its origins pedro pascals portrayal of joel and bella ramseys embodiment of ellie are nothing short of revelatory breathing life into characters beloved by gamers and newcomers alike from the outset its evident that every frame of this series is crafted with care and reverence for the source material the meticulous attention to detail from the haunting landscapes to the intimate character moments creates an immersive experience that lingers long after the credits roll while some may quibble over deviations from the games narrative these departures serve to enrich the storytelling offering fresh insights and emotional depth that resonate on a profound level the chemistry between pascal and ramsey is palpable driving home the series central themes of love sacrifice and the resilience of the human spirit visually stunning and thematically resonant the last of us is a triumph of adaptation that honors the legacy of the game while forging its own path its a testament to the power of storytelling to inspire provoke and ultimately connect us to our shared humanity
2,read the reviews and thought i would just remove the label asap to prevent snags since i loved the item however the item came with unrepairable holes not just snags and they are either on the neck or front sleeve which forces me to return the item asap didnt even try it on so sad but i still love retailer
2,i wish this shirt would not have had so much material it would make a great maternity top if you are really thin it might work for you too
2,the material was thin showed every lump youd rather hide and clung to the body even the sleeves were tight looked inexpensive
2,i couldnt wait to get this dress i bought it and was instantly disappointed when i took it out of the bag while the fabric was beautiful the sizing was way off this dress claims to be long and i could tell instantly it wasnt it barely covered my rear i also know its supposed to be flowy but it was really really wide i can see this working for someone around feet tall who is wider
2,as soon as i saw this dress online i loved it and ordered it unfortunately it just didnt work for me i tried it in a small medium and large for reference im lbs d the dress is really pretty in person but i looked like a little girl in it my daughter who is lbs a also tried it on and she too looked like a little girl in it the material is beautiful along with the detail at the neckline however the neckline is not open like in the picture its more pushed toget
2,this dress reminds me of a fabric used for curtains it is sturdy beautiful and strong i looked like a large picture window in it if i was and pounds it may have worked
2,i saw this in the store and was glad i didnt order it earlier online i thought it would be beautifully stitched but it was rather flat and unimpressive in person i like more unusual and flattering pieces and this just wasnt it no compliments here
2,material was a tad rough for my liking the color did nothing for my olive complexion given the price of this shirt even with off i dont think its worth it if im spending on a blouse i need to love it and i do not love this onegoing back
2,sctrachy short boxy stiff loved the idea of this sweater but this was not what i was hoping for
2,although i am sure that some people would like thisit is not traditional in any sense of the word it is fusion cooking this is texmex cuisine which obviously has been tweaked from traditional mexican food made to please those north of the border here in texas people put beef in just about everything we always use cheese in our rellenos and enchiladastraditional enchiladas are made with corn tortillas as the author notedthe sauce recipe here is very much the same as canned sauce in that both use tomato products i can tell you with authority that most restaurants and mexican homes such as ours never use tomato products in our enchilada sauce california northern and central mexico dont use tomatoes in this way traditionallyas we live in texas i encounter all sorts of deviations from traditional mexican food some are ok but hubby will not eat enchiladas anywhere but at home due to the fact he is always disappointed in their preparation the same is true with many mexican families herefor my enchilada sauce i only use diced onion cooked in oil until transparent then i add the flour and spices to create a roux and cook for at least minutes i then add the broth better than bouillon chicken and simmer for minutes i dont add salt as there is enough in the broth my spice mixture is secret and handed down so i will not offer it here
2,i am of average height but these pants are so long i considered altering them because i like the print but i dont think its worth the effort for workout attire so theyre going back shame
2,didnt like the taste was kinda blaw
2,when i saw this jacket in store i fell in love with it the colors with the quilting and gold studs are gorgeous i am dd with petite frame i tried a m on in store and the sleeves were super long and wide the s was too small across chest and hung open oddly the jacket is a nice heavy weight and great quality i ordered a petite m and it was no better i literally looked like a big marshmallowa linebacker the sleeves were so unflattering where it looked like i was wearing pvc
2,didnt work on this curvy gal sizing up would have helped with the button gaps but the flowy shape of the blouse would have looked too maternity on a larger size major pass
2,i accept the fact that the other family members have like zero screen time okay so its called wednesday for a reason however it would be more enjoyable if i saw the other characters a little more a big reason for that is that wednesday is completely unlikable and thats a big problem what i loved about the previous adams movies is that the addams family had each others back wednesday hates her family and treats her friends like trash unfortunately its not done in a charming way i feel like they went too far with making wednesday cold and they took away her substance this is a huge flaw because you have to be able to like the character and care about them i think that the show could improve if they realize this and make wednesday more tolerable no one can play wednesday like christina ricci however the actress did a good job the problem lies within the writing i actually hope for a season but i hope they improve the actual problems because this could be a good show maybe give wednesday a soul and make her a bit more charming the adams were always good people who enjoyed being different and i embrace that in this one no one has a personality and all the characters lack charm especially wednesday
2,its a rather boring tank i thought itd be perfect under a cardigan for work but decided against it the fit is boxy and does not look good on a girl with curves
2,with all of the glowing reviews of this dress i so badly wanted to adore this very special cocktail dress it fit nicely the quality was great but there is a decorative line of hook and eyes down the front which come undone with the slightest movement i wore the dress out one time and was paranoid the entire time kept glancing down to make sure i hadnt come undressed i suppose i couldve gotten out the needlenose and crimped them all shut but decided to take it back i didnt see tha
2,the dress is extremely high quality i purchased the dress in black the white collared shirt that the model is wearing under the dress is not part of the dress the dress overall is like a balloon unless youre extremely tall and skinny this dress makes you look bigger i ordered the small petite and am lbs and i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately its going back the petite hits inches above the knee for reference
2,this show is spectacular and i highly recommend it
2,despite retailers claim that they have fixed the button issue on this coat beware they havent i ordered this coat november th feeling safe that the issue that scores of other reviewers had noted was fixed because retailer indicated rest assured this issue has been fixed as noted in the item description feeling confident that id get a nondefective coat at this late date in the quality assurance cycle i was severely disappointed to open my shipment tonight nov th immediately di
2,nice design but very wrinkly fabric that doesnt fall well also as has happened to me before retailer sent me a dress clearly wornused and returned by someone else with hair all over it you would think they would at least look at returned dresses to make sure that the returned clothes were free of stains and hair before they send them out
2,runs very large ordered a smaller size due to other reviews but should have ordered several sizes smaller
2,nd season syndrome where a tv show fails to carry on the same quality of storytelling as season im seeing far too many of these shows and unfortunately reacher is one of them im going to be honest the days of me liking lee childs books are over i couldnt even get past chapter of the last book i got i did however like season of reacher it felt like a lee child book the story and supporting cast for that story were great it held my interest far more than season season is another matter nothing about this is great i havent finished the season yet i probably will since ive made it through most of it i dont like the supporting cast they keep insisting on bringing neagley back she was the only supporting character who i didnt like in season so of course she is there in season and i see season as well reacher in the books didnt have this backup and i dont think she should be here either it defeats the purpose of the reacher character the story for season is meh i may give season a chance but i find when a show has nd season syndrome they normally dont improve again
2,i wish this fit me better i love the inside fur it is extremely soft but it doesnt look flattering at all it makes my shoulders look really broad and it was shorter in the length than i wanted it wanted it fit over my butt or cover half and it sits a little below my waist unfortunately i am taking it back great idea though
2,this has way too much lemon i havent tried it with reduced or zero lemon juice but i think it would probably be pretty bland it needs more garlic and something to give it a little zing granted though it was a very easy experiment
2,this tunic looks awesome in the picture however it is made of an uncomfortable sweaterlike material not left of centers normal skin cotton i was disappointed once i saw this in person not a great material for summer
2,meh meh meh tim burton and the adams family i thought there could go nothing wrong but and dont get me wrong it was boring and nothing like tim burton movies usually are wednesday was perfect and she really got it going but the story was boring and story was not interesting enough to let me love it i was hoping for seeing more of the normal school and not just minutes with the phiranas also expected a little blood or something i hope the last couple of episodes are not so boring and slow and a little less highschool serie like i dont get the hype and i am sorry for that but i will finish it
2,i really like this dressshirt its great for layering super cute and will hide my traditional holiday and this years pregnancy weight gain i think it will be so cute with some leggings and boots unfortunately the back panel of the dress does not seem to vary based on the size this may sound weird but ive tried on an and a and the ability to reach forward didnt change between the two sizes i just returned the and am hopeful the i ordered will be slightly roomier in the back
2,really cute piece but its huge i ordered an xxs petite and it was unfortunately extremely wide and not flattering returning
2,i waited a long time to get this top unfortunately i will be returning the sides are gathered and stick out a lot on the sides not as pictured the sides should have been pleated it runs smaller in the bust and when closed it was a little snug afraid this might shrink with dry cleaning or washing the design is unique and wish this top would of worked
2,i dont normally write reviews but i purchased this dress in white in different sizes and each dress had the same flaw the hems were very uneven on all three this dress was poorly sewn its a shame because it looked awesome online i was very disappointed
2,i just made these following the recipe exactly and they came out very thin not at all like the picture maybe refrigerate the dough next time
2,based on the other reviews i sized down from my usual p to a p but this dress was still ridiculously huge and extremely unflattering i could tell the minute i took it out of the package it wouldnt work i cant imagine this would flatter very many people the front photo of the model is incredibly deceptive very disappointedthis will be going back for sure
2,battery performance is very bad only hours
2,as a working cook for over years i was dubious about the idea of adding a flour slurry so late in the cooking process regrettably i was correct the flavor was overwhelmed by raw flouri would suggest making the rue thats what it is in the pot before adding the liquidsyou do that and leave out most if not all of the halfhalf then you will come closer to a perfect chowderother than those issues the flavor profile was on point i look forward to trying this again while trusting in my instincts
2,all is perfect amazing cash great screenplay amd a very well direction
2,waste of money
2,i made this recipe today and i would have to say its nothing great i did not add the potatoes and celery as these are not things i would typically expect in a cheeseburger soup however i did add the carrots as it is nice to have some veggies in there i also added macaroni so it wasnt just liquid cheese i was eating i guess i just hate american cheese its very fake tasting and leaves a sticky coating in your mouth i am going to try this recipe again with real cheddar and hopefully it comes out tastier
2,video hang problem
2,i was hoping that this recipe would be a real winner being that it got previous rave reviews but i was very disappointed this cake lacked in flavor and sweetness and was too dense the only saving grace was the frosting but then we decided that it still wasnt worth it so it went into the trash back to the drawing board
2,this looked like such a cute casual skirt when i picked it up but like other reviewers have said it runs small im usually a xs in retailer skirts but they only had a small to try on i was able to get it on but did notice it was snug pulling on past my hips however once on i couldnt figure out how id wear this i wouldnt pair this with a flowy top but tucking something in didnt seem like a good idea either between the pleats and elastic waist it will make almost anyone look like they ha
2,very cute top but runs very very big im ft in tall lbs i ordered the xs but it was so big it looked like a maternity top sadly returned the top otherwise the top was made of good quality fabric
2,in the words of my husband looks like youre wearing a bag im althetic and short maybe this works best on tall and very slim
2,i really loved this in the catalog the fabric and details are very pretty however its a lot of fabric without much form my husband suggested it for maternity not realizing it has fitted slip not for curvy hourglass had to send it back
2,the pattern is very adorable unfortunately the design is flawed sizing is great at the waist and hip and the length is spot on but the top is wide its strange because i dont think it would fit someone that was bustier than me either will return im considering buying again on sale and having a tailor correct it
2,i had a dress that felt like this in it jiggles even if you dont no amount of spanx can cure a dress jiggling of its own accord the neckline that i had thought would be classic instead veered into frumpy all in all i felt like it belonged in a discount store surrounded by polyester brethren
2,giving a review after one month of use for getting charged its taking hrs and battery is draining too quickly mostly in hrs not much hd clarity design is good
2,i was so excited to get these i paid for two day shipping and ordered medium and large sadly they did not fit i usually wear medium but ordered both just in case im very disappointed that they run so small and are not true to size they are super cute from someone skinny
2,battery backup very bad
2,i was hoping that this would be a nice neutral layering staple but it simply leaves a lot to be desired it fits tts length is finethe inside is some but the outside darker material is stiff and cheap kinda canvas feeling the material is super stiff which makes it flare out like like a tent in a super unflattering way it also is on the thinnish side it looks in the model shot like it would be a little thicker and warm this is definitely going back
2,im and bough a size regular this is so short that if you wear with jeans you can see a midriff cute pattern but im returning it
2,woah these jeans looked ridiculous on me i felt as though it was and i was raiding my moms closet the combination of the light wash the crop leg and high waist with the odd stitching around the midsection make this a no it really accentuates any pouch you may have i was looking for a high waisted denim but these are very unflattering i am curvy no no no
2,we just moved into a house we bought and it had apple trees dont know what kind they were but the sauce did not thicken up my crust was good does it matter what kind of apples i used i cooked it longer then what it said any suggestions for next time
2,this dress is cuter is person than online but it has one huge issue there is a teeny tiny button at the neck that is held on by a thread and requires fingers the size of a two year old to get open it fell off the minute i tried to undo it i cant believe these other reviewers didnt have the same problem or maybe they put a snap there instead too bad
2,the brown sugar needs to be mixed into the salad and there should be more of it stars
2,first of all mine arrived in a regular denim shade not the dark wash shown also the style is more like a blazer and it was huge i am and ordered the petite xs but even xxs would have looked like a baggy blazer as well the sleeves came barely past my wrists they are designed to cuff as the model has done perhaps on someone taller and younger it would look edgy and chic the quality is excellent with some nice details this might be one to try in person if you can
2,thought i would splurge on a tracy reese coat i got a size small felt huge on me and i looked like a wooly mammoth very unflattering another reviewer also mentioned on how it flairs slightly at the bottomadding to the overall bad look i had it on for about seconds and put it back in the bag to return dint have to ponder about it at all
2,love the fit of the jeans just wish there was a couple more inches at the bottom these jeans have a inch inseam not so they hit at a very odd place on my calf return for reference im
2,i built a new wardrobe around the three lovely velvet blazers moss copper and burgundy they are soft wellfitting pretty linings and very satisfactory this new version is stiff material and illfitting not coming in petite is a problem and it may fit others better but it is too full across the front with the stiff materials this is a bad fit disappointing and going back
2,in each episode at least minutes distributed to scenes in the episode have no effect on the development of events and it is possible to delete them easily and also from some of these scenes scenes between john and herself some of them really show what the character believes and some of them do not help the coloring is one of the distinct and distinctive signs in this series there are two colors in the series one in gilead which is coloring in dark yellow or dark blue which gave a feeling of discomfort and on the contrary in canada the coloring was saturated with colors and comfortable for the eye more and here lies the genius and it is to show the areas where they are resting and the areas that have discomfort and fatigue to the nerves by coloring acting in the series is a question mark for me for example the character of elizabeth moss was sometimes excellent and some of them are exaggerated acting accompanied by some of the exaggerations and the performance of the actress who performed the role of serena was above the excellent and is better away completely from weakness or vulgarity as for farids performance he was weak at times especially in the third season the other seasons were impressive flashback scenes abounded in the series and they were without any benefit the events that affected the building of the characters and the series failed to present it or its importance and i felt that it was just a waste of time there are many loopholes at the level of dramatic construction so i could not interact or be affected by any of the characters i will explain in the next point and from the loopholes of the dramatic construction are the reasons for this brutal world in a moment and the characters turned so quickly to all these evils and also there are problems on the level building science fiction and it is also linked to the children of the dramatic and the dimensions of this world and that brutality that exists among people one of the solutions that i would have put forward is for example that these people are drugged and are being manipulated and the series was able to present that due to the nature of its classification and it is science fiction building the characters themselves and their absolute evil and not explaining how they were transformed into all these evils montage clips have no relation to events and they do not even help in the development of characters or their expression such as repetition of the sense of suffering from people to the point of vulgarity at the end of the following season i began to be affected more by the characters due to the development of events series the series quotes some harriet ideas which are smuggling some persecuted people from their place to better places for them the series was clever in dropping some symbols on the islamic world and the arab world and i noticed that from the veiling of women aunts and the use of mothers and slaves and marriage for religious reasons and also when searching for the word gilad i found that it is a region in the arab countries in the past during the era of the islamic state and show the persecution of women in those countries
2,as a rule we love porcupine meatballs just not this recipe the cup of water with the beef makes them ridiculously soggy and they dont hold their shape while browning and end up as mush
2,this shirt is unflattering and boxy it does not look cute at all on me i am returning
2,wanted to love this sweater for its beautiful colors and cute graphic but the fit is uncomfortably small and it is so itchy i was yelling get it off in the fitting room bummer
2,way too sweet the crisp topping was nice there was a nice balance of oats to sugar and butter and flour the apple mixture was horribly sweet i love sweet but after a few bites i had enough my son and husband who usually pick away at the rest of the pan finished theirs but that was it i was ready to throw the rest away when i decided to use it as a topping for steel cut oats this morning with a ratio of two parts oat to apple topping it was perfect with unsweetened coffee next time i would cut the sugar in half it is also a nice mixin with greek yogurt but as a dessert a big disappointment for such great reviews
2,have just binge watched both series of reacher really enjoyed series the actor playing reacher is very different to tom cruises version loved the story the pace it moved getting to know the characters the twists in the story and the sound track looked forward to series what a let down i felt like i was watching a real life cartoon some of the dialogue fighting scenes and set pieces looked very staged one of the characters tells reacher that he looks tired and dogged and he does i believed him more in the first series and had no desire to champion him in the nd series will be interesting to see what they do with series
2,to sweet i added mustard and it cut the sweetness but still did not care for it
2,disappointed this top has a boxy shape and looked like a mini moo moo on me i have a similar shape as the model and it looked nothing like that on me bummer i liked the quality and weight not too heavy nor too light but shape is unflattering its going back
2,i purchased this laptop before daysbut now laptop automatically going into shutdownreally very bad automatically shutdown very poor laptop
2,touch pad is not working properly
2,i really wanted to love this cardigan and did until i tried it on the arms are so tight i ordered in a m which is my normal retailer size but couldnt move my arms took it back was going to try in a l but store didnt have any for the price i need to be able to move my arms
2,this dress looked great on the hanger but once on it did absolutely nothing for me navy is one of my most flattering colors but the navy in the dress did not make up for the yucky second color that was so blah it just reminded me of dirt that second color made me look drab i am with a long torso and wear a size in tts tops and dresses but the waist on this dress hit at an uncomfortable spot between by waist and ribs i really needed the waist to be dropped further or higher
2,i ordered this because the reviews were outstanding i am returning it although the embroidery looks fine on screen in person it looks cheap and tacky moreover the high ruffled neck goes a step too far into overthetop victorian cutesy overpriced to boot obviously mine is a minority opinion
2,as i was making the soup i was wondering why there was no garlic or onion looking at the spices i only see salt and pepper i just knew this soup was going to be bland and i dont want to make something and it not be great i melted the butter and added garlic and onion i also added crumbled bacon and cubed ham i used red pepper flakes instead of the hot sauce i also thicken the soup more to get a more like a chowder consistensy i chopped in some fresh parsley just before serving after my changes i loved it
2,not flattering and not the color it appears online this is really a pink shirt
2,i really wanted to love this sweater however it fell much shorter on my frame than it falls on the model between my belly button and hip and the sleeves ended just below my elbow and were much more voluminous than they appear in the product shot i do have long monkey arms though so on someone more petite it would probably fit more like the model shot the quality of the knit seems nice however the zipper used is very slim and light weight and got stuck twice just while i was trying i
2,i really wanted to love this dress but it just didnt fit in anyway i ordered an xs petite and it was very large the lacing in the back is completely useless and thats what i liked about the dress i was thinking it would be unlaced more at the top because of chest and then lace more tightly near the waist it was completely closed off and the dress was still very loose and unflattering beautiful fabric great color combo bad fit
2,i was missing a fantastic universe so i was excited when i heard tim burton but ive never expected this much for the time being i watched first episode but i can easily say wednesday is one of the best series ive seen in netflix jenna ortega gives to audience a good performance i see hopkins hannibal lecter in her face and eyes she makes me curious and exciting about the next episode she forces me watch every scene again and again also you can feel characters weaknesses interests and love from her face even she does not tell about them her future is so bright i think i hope she wil grow as an actress
2,very minor spoilers the beginning scene of episode one completely drew me in i thought cool this is going to be a fun series where were treated to wednesdays hijinx as she torments the students at a regular high school but that didnt happen instead shes shipped off to a school where she can try to fit in with other outcasts vampires werewolves etc i was so disappointed but i continued to watch and im glad i did what unraveled was a well written supernatural thrillermurder mystery the acting the writing the plot the cinematography everything was top notch the writers attention to detail was very welcome and their subtle and sometimes overt references to addams family lore was spot on on top of that jenna ortegas portrayal of wednesday was just perfect of course there were some small quibbles minor plot holes questionable dialog here and there and some forgettable teen angst that detracted from the viewing experience but overall this was very enjoyable and i would heartily recommend it
2,there isnt a whole lot that i did like about this dress the shoulders have large poufs the fabric isnt very soft and its not flattering maybe with a belt i could be tempted but i wasnt too fond of the dress
2,very nice fabric and quality but runs very large i had to return my pair of a size stinks to pay for shipping on a product that looks so different in the picture
2,i am obsessed with denim and have two other pairs of ag jeans from retailer that i am very happy with my recent preference has been for highrise skinny jeans and decided to give these a try because of the versatile medium wash when i tried these on in my normal size they were so cute that i bought them fullpriced i could tell that the material was pretty stretchy which is what makes them soft and comfortable but was not expecting them to stretch out and sag after a few hours by th
2,i wanted to like this top especially because of its comfortable material and color but the asymmetrical shape didnt hang well on me it also runs big i got a small and although the bodice fit okay the sleeves were long and the bottom of the top looked mishaped and dumpy this top will be going back
2,you have to be a contortionist to get this bra on it slips over your head and i needed my yo daughter to help me pull it down past my elbows ridiculously impractical why oh why didnt heather give it a hook and loop closure instead
2,i have to assume that the brand new gb sandisk ultra class sdxc card is responsible for the occasional video recording stutterpausing that has happened since i started using it today prior to that never had an issue with my previous sandisk sdhc card but today on its maiden trip it has led each video only minutes long each to have several performance issues that by default i have to attribute to the card since nothing else has changed and ive never had an issue in the four months that ive had my galaxy note no problems formatting this card though or installingusing it otherwise
2,camara not clear
2,i gave the otter to my nephew for birth after weeks the otter was broken so a new one ordered and surprised broken again after months it is a mystery to me how this can happen because it lies only next to a month old baby plays music every once in a while and simulates breathing movements the mechanics of the breathing simulation is also what constantly breaks from kulanz amazon returns the money for stars i resist to order the otter a third time but at the express request of the father since the little one likes the otter there is a third attempt
2,i wanted to like this so much its a great good girl dress church dress however it makes no sense its a summer dress with massively thick lining that snags im petite and busty and it made me look and feel very wide
2,do not add the water in the first step it renders the meatballs to a fluid and they fall apart during browning
2,i was disappointed when i got this romper in the mail the picture looks much cuter than in person although its true to size it looks pretty baggy on also i thought the grey top and blue bottom were too similarly colored more contrast would have been nice im returning this item
2,i could not get this brand of memory card to work in my roku it would not format correctly i had to return this for another brand which worked ok
2,i wanted to like this top as the fabric was nice and thick but found that it dipped too low beneath the armpits which would be ok if your lats are in perfect shape but ive always found that cut made mine look a bit saggy and im not heavy not great enough to keep in my opinion
2,i agree with the other reviewer the snaps at the ankle are a cute idea but bad in execution they look and feel odd when on these fit tts and they are soft with decent stretch but the rise is much lower on me than other rise jeans i have as a yearold woman they seemed inappropriately lowhanging on me as an aside these will def color transfer there is a whole lotta rinse on these and they have a strange chemical smell to them not sure if that will diss
2,it just isnt that flattering on me it looks kind of old and dingy even though its brand new it fits fine but doesnt do much to highlight my curves it just kind of hangs there the length is somewhat awkward i bought the petite version maybe it would look good on someone tall and skinny like the model its gathered around the stomach area and longer in the front which reminded me of maternity wear it does appear to be pretty well made top part is lined overall its not terrible
2,maeve is one of my favorite retailer designers usually fall in love with a blouse only to look at the tag and discover its by maeve go figure this top is just atrocious though does nothing for girls with a larger chest very boxy and unflattering gorgeous colors though and the sleeve concept is cute however where the sleeve meets the shirt looks cheap and thrown on not impressed
2,this is a crop top but super boxy and wide i expected it to be more fitted in the waist since it sits out away a from the body a lot it was not flattering i also felt the stitching to be a bit matronly for me too bad as i am having such a hard time finding tops and im willing to pay full price for something that works
2,not full hd display battery average
2,keyboard is freezingsound automatically freezing in that time laptop restart after restart its good but after using one hour problem again come
2,the message of the handmaids tale is strong and important especially now its well acted for the most part its plot on paper sounds gripping but amidst the gratuitous close ups of junes face the numerous dragged out scenes and the confusing and downright frustrating decisions made by all the charactersto the point where most characters become borderline unlikable it all could possibly be forgiven if the show wasnt so damn slow i think about how much of a compelling story and characters arcs that were covered in seasons of breaking bad by the th season of handmaids tale it felt like only a handful of episodes of actual progress in the storyline had occurred its a shame for such a groundbreaking story that it has been written into the wind
2,i loved the style of this shirt so much that i bought two of them unfortunately after washing the turquoise one it sprang several holes the same thing happened to the second one after one wash i purchased several of these shirts in the tank style over this past summer and they have washed and worn great i think the fabric quality and craftsmanship has gone way downhill at retailer lately very disappointed
2,it was watchable but i didnt love it im not sure just how involved burton actually was with this project it doesnt feel like he was massively involved because this series really didnt scream burtonesque to me he supposedly directed the series but a few different directors names pop up in the credits i was excited to see it when i found out tims name was attached to it but it ended up being far too teeny high school drama for my liking i did like jenna ortega as wednesday i thought she portrayed the character well and made it her own uncle fester was okay as well and thing but ya know hes a hand the casting for the rest of the addams however i didnt like they just didnt capture the essence of the characters in my eyes this series had its moments but as a whole i just didnt get what i was hoping for and was left a bit disappointed
2,these pants look beautiful when you first see them it goes downhill from there the waist is very small in relation to the rest of the pants it felt fine when pulled up but it is a struggle i could get past that but when i looked in the mirror i could see right through them no lining and not very thick material for this price a real bummer especially since it was a birthday gift
2,first off pie didnt taste bad however all this talk of grandmas special apple pie is disingenuous at best the pie came out with a lot of liquid i like a nice wholesome and crispy apple pie not a wet apple pie this pie is grandmas wap wet a pie
2,as a avid jack reacher fan its nice to report that this series has started with a bang hes so much more like the reacher of the books tall and strong and vicious
2,these look nothing like the picture they are super highwaisted longer than they look in this picture i felt as if i was wearing a pair of jeans from the s that just fit terribly i thought they were going to be a pair of cropped wide legs they are far from it the color was also much lighter than shown in picture super unflattering just not for me theyre going back
2,when i read car coat i expect a little more weight it really is just a thin long blazer also the colors appear different online i expected a redmaroon with bue and white stripe so maybe i misread completely it is actually brownmustardbeige combo not what i expected so it will be a return
2,what a pity this blouse has a beautiful design however it doesnt fit well on the body its not really a size problem its just not a well fitted blouse the color is very deceptive it looks white on the picture but its actually pink im probably going to return it
2,i disagree with other reviewers on this it looks a lot better in picture on the model i found it to run large and not fit in the most flattering way fabric feels great i want to love it but it is going back
2,this dress has a great shape and fabric but the v neckline is too deeplow and the arm holes are also cut too low would loved to have been able to keep it but had to return
2,i bough it because it said it was fast but not im only getting mbs with an galaxy note ii a very fast an excellent phone
2,looks like a pregnancy top a lot gathers in front and back added pounds to me not flattering on much longer than on the model and the color is not white its white with a weird tan taupe stripe i returned it same day i received it which was disappointing
2,i have hard time calling this the best ever it took min longer than estimated to bake and the top was all crusty and dark because of the high amount of sugar i also made a batch of the basic banana bread muffins and preferred that recipe a lot more
2,i dont know what is happening and i love it i would watch for the opening credits and the music alone but the talent and acting is also brilliant rated stars for now but may revise to once i complete the season
2,i really wanted to like this top in person though the fit was too large and boxy i did order a smaller size based on other reviews but it was still too sacklike i got the grey motif pattern which i thought was quite pretty and interesting the material was nice and lightweight perhaps it would look better on someone with a straight figure and small bust
2,i was drawn to this top because of the interesting and detailed straps which are embroidered with a lovely triangle pattern however the embroidery takes away any stretchyness or give in the cotton and makes the top a beautiful but illfitting harness for anyone with any breasts or fullfigured lusciousness the worst part is that the top hem along the top is embroidered and rigid just like the straps so it feels like you are wearing an uncomfortable strapless top i wanted to keep this but h
2,sweet otterbut after a very short time the cracking when inhaling becomes very disturbing as the engine noise overall really a pity great idea bad implementation
2,as a tall girl i was thrilled to see that these pants come in longs they are amazing for dressing up or sassing up and outfit i anxiously anticipated their arrival and wore them the very first night i bought them however as someone previously mentioned the quality is poor after wearing them to they symphony the knee tore while i was sitting in my seat i really dont see a way to avoid this from happening since i had not moved im sooo upset because i absolutely loved these pants
2,unique print but not great execution the pant legs are very tight i have average sized calves and i sized up one size the hook closure was oddly tight and difficult to clasp when i first saw the color it looked like burnt sienna or a dried blood color too bad this didnt work out
2,it just tasted funny to me
2,i bought this top in two colorsi think its a really cute easy top to wear but the fabric is extremely thin and poor quality i tucked the front into a pair of shorts and i can already see a small snag forming which im sure will be a hole in no time two stars only because i really do like the look of the top generally i just wish it was something that was going to last beyond a couple of wears
2,i used this product for last and a half year then the major issues i faced are with hinges they are very faulty and tight and secondly the keyboard which is now not working this brand has very poor after sales services
2,this would have been a cute top but the shoulder seams come halfway down the arm and give it a really weird shape it looks smooth and fine on the model but in real life they stick out and make you look boxy too bad
2,lightweight good looking good battery backup performance is very good due to ssd overall value for money only extra i needed was msoffice which isnt provided in laptop rest all is amazing another issue i see is with respect to speakers the sound is low could have been better update reducing another star as stopped working in months repair is taking normally days as promised by service centre team i now realise that there is a reason why hp lenovo acer dell are top bran read more
2,seasons one and two were excellent seasons two of the most compelling seasons ever for a television series season three started to get ridiculous and i couldnt fathom how june didnt get put on the wall and started actively hoping it would happen to bring some credibility back to the show i rolled my eyes all through season four and now im basically hatewatching season five as the show has devolved into a ridiculous wile e coyote vs the road runner episode such is the state of june and serenas rivalry add to the fact that people involved in this show seem to think that close ups of june seething are akin to character development and youve got one of the biggest drop offs in quality ive ever seen in a series plus every single character seems intent on taking the dumbest decisions possible so i have to wonder if the writers of this show are laughing at the audience the five stars given are all for the first two seasons
2,i agree with the previous reviewer that the fabric and details are beautiful but with the shirring from the neckline and absolutely no fitting anywhere my shape got totally lost and i looked huge the difference in length of the dress and slip really bothered me as well possibly great for pregnancy because you look like your about months anyway
2,ive read a few reviews about how this is timely because of what is happening in america this is accurate but it wasnt my first thought im a student of north korea in the sense that im a layperson who has become rather well read on the subject if you want to understand how the average person in north korea lives and feels watch this show the public executions the heavily patrolled borders the ritualized public and private behavior the rigid hierarchy and the utter lack of free speech come to mind its important to draw this type of analogy because its easy to look at this show and think of how utterly impossible it would be in modern times million people in north korea are dealing with this type of evil totalitarianism and it is arguably worse than the handmaids tale this is a dark show with heavy emotional content if you want something to escape and forget about your life this probably isnt it in the first episode i felt things that hit me harder than i anticipated and it didnt let up i imagine that for most of my fellow women this show will be difficult to watch at times lets get to the review though the cinematography is beautiful it manages a surreal ghostly type of feel it is very distinct and the look of the show complements the story perfectly the writing is nothing short of perfect in addition to the social issues this show addresses the writers have a great deal of skill with the simple craft of writing this is not true of the majority of shows for example dear white people deals with issues of prejudice and oppression but the writers havent mastered the basics what does this mean in practice the handmaids tale featured a simple game of scrabble between offredjune and the commander instead of being boring i was literally on the edge of my seat because the scene was fraught with tension suspense and mystery none of the characters are all bad there are countless moments of compassion for serena joy offredjunes arguably main opponent even though i hate her for tormenting offredjune i understand her plight she helped create a movement that ended up harming her and shes terribly conflicted about that im surprised at how nuanced the commander is and i love what they do with his character hes kind to offredjune he enjoys her company obviously hes one of the chief antagonists of the show because he is actively oppressing people but i think this is deeper than that this show explores quite effectively the harmful impact that sexism has on women and men too even aunt lydia has moments of caring for some of the girls the point is they could have created one dimensional villains and left it at that instead they chose to humanize the villains and the conflict is riveting
2,i love chicken noodle soup and was anxious to try this recipie i should not have added the sour cream i could not eat the soup because adding the the sour cream made it sour tasting i love sour cream but not in soup
2,love the tegan tunic version of this dress i assumed since it looked identical except for the length that the sizing was the same but i was wrong this runs so big i got a s in the tegan but the s in this dress looked like an oversized potato sack on i highly recommend ordering at least sizes down unless you want to look tenty
2,i ordered this in a small and medium hoping one would work but the previous reviews were exactly correct the bodice is way too small in proportion to the rest of the jumpsuit the bottom has lots of fabric which wouldnt be bad except you have to go up a size to make the bodice fit then the bottom becomes overwhelming i am and so i have a slim build and couldnt get the bodice to zip in a small the medium would have needed altering which wouldnt have fixed the extra fabric on th
2,the fabric and its texture didnt meet my expectations unfortunately there were too much fray and castoff of edge yarns of a fabric however this will fit if you wear over the swimming wears
2,unfortunately i didnt see that you have to pay the return shipment yourself the package had exactly the size that it can only be sent expensivelywe disturbed the following the breathing movements we find rather creepy and totally unnatural cant imagine that a child no infant our child is already months old does not find that strangethe volume at the lowest level was still too loud for us if you imagine listening to the music in a totally quiet dark room i would find the music too present and no background musicunfortunately you cant take the animal out and look at it rationally then you would irrevocably destroy the packaging
2,this whole order was disappointing the main piece i ordered was cancelled and the two remaining items this sweater included were poorly made there was a snagthread hanging out in the middle of the front of the sweater tried to tuck it in but it wouldnt stay so ill be returning it
2,not ok
2,one of mote favorite shows of all time my attention is directed at the screen the hole episode every episodes for every season
2,i have started watching this today for the first time just to see gina carano in this i loved the original star wars films i hated the phantom menace but loved the revenge of the sith and as a result i was very eager to see the new star wars films however all three were dreadful i therefore gave up on star wars i have watched this series today solely for one reason to see gina carano in this and i will say the series so far is fantastic and the best thing since revenge of the sith i love its gritty atmosphere as opposed to aiming for children gina carano is way better than daisy radley and much more believable an action heroine and has way more charisma disney are muppets for sacking the best actress suited for star wars
2,i followed this recipe exactly as it said and the batter came out more like crepe batter i had to add some extra flour to thicken it up still cooking so i have yet to taste
2,this sweaterjacket looks just like the photo in real life but the inside is so scratchy i physically recoiled when trying it on as the interior of the sleeves feels like sandpaper unlined and uncomfortable no thank you should you choose to proceed i found the fit tts im wear an and the medium worked for me
2,this show is mislabeled as a comedy or dark comedy the only thing laughable is that this script was greenlit if it werent for the caliber of actors viewers would see this is as nothing but vile and a waste of time
2,i like flowy tops because i have a bit of a belly and i like to camouflage it but this top was really flowy the fabric is great and the embroidery is beautiful i was hoping for this to be a holiday staple this year it has to go back though just too large i dont love it quite enough to order a size down
2,couldnt make it work even belted ivory color is darker irldingy light tan like dirty vintage drop waist is not dropped at all just a maternityish cut that starts boxyloose high up below bust then abruptly flares out at bellybutton level not low hip into the skirt i usually find aline cuts good at giving illusion of a willowy curvy waist but this does notadds ten pounds poly fabric heavyhot rayon lining awkward and doesnt flowdrape lb a tried xs
2,i gulped when i put this in my bag during retailer days because the price was still too much but thought this has to be wonderful to charge so much right boy was i wrong this is a sweater knit with a very deep vneck thats incredibly boxy and unattractive the knit shed all over my pants in the few minutes i had it on i ordered in xl having never tried this designer and that was a mistake because i generally wear large or medium it was swimming on me the stripes arent as cute in real life
2,dress appears to be slim fit but thats far from the case usually wear an xs regular because i have a long torso for my but it just hung on me like a heavy sack i have a hard time finding dresses now that im not working and like to have a couple on hand for all purpose occasionsweddings memorials special occasions i hoped this one would meet my needs disappointed
2,this is a beautiful dress but the fit was strange i have a small waist and larger hips i generally wear a in a fit flare style but styles like this i generally wear a for my hips even in a this was catching on my hips and looked kind of dumpy on my top half i really think this dress would be great on a frame that had wider shoulders and smaller hips it really is pretty
2,i love this jump suit sorta looks great on but the dye rubs off on your skin i washed it and its still happening when you put your hand in your pockets they come out blue knees are blue thighs etc i looked dirty by the end of the day wish i could return it fit and look great not great after wear
2,speaker quality is very bad guys plz dont buy this and flipkart also provide bad services
2,when i saw this blouse online i thought it was so cute i love the floral detail unfortunately it looks much cuter online than it does in person it has no shape so it is not flattering to the figure it might look better tucked in or partially tucked in as shown in the picture but it did not look good completely tucked out i was also not a fan of the fabric in the picture the fabric looks dressier than it is the front is more polyester and is a little dressier but not what i envisioned t
2,ive rarely seen such crap this is probably the most boring series ive ever seen in fact its by and for monkeys whose brains are not in their heads but further down fortunately i had only prebooked the series because after three episodes of the first season i had reached the peak of tolerance not a single truly intelligent line of dialog normally series improve after the first episode but here its one meaningless episode after another i dont even want to imagine what kind of nonsense the rest is you would have been better off donating the money or burn it that would be more entertaining than this one can only hope that no producer can be found to produce something comparable
2,worest battery backup charging only hours capacity dont buy this laptop
2,i really loved this vest online and decided to try it on in store it was really cute on and fit nicely so i purchased it in my normal size and took it on a vacation first time wearing it and the color transferred all over my white shirt even though it says it is prewashed i am very disappointed considering how expensive this was overall it is very cute but it may ruin your clothes so beware
2,i was excited to see this top ordered it and was disappointed it was too tight across the chest and had too much fabric around the bottom i tried this on times hoping for i had been wrong in previous assessments no luck
2,i really wanted to love this dress but i think the proportions are very weird im and usually go for an eight in unstructured dresses and a in more structured dresses it runs small throughout and is too short for me to feel comfortable wearing to work the front is nicely detailed but the back looks weirdly forgotten and could use more detailing i tried on three different sizes and and they all pulled weirdly at the chest theres a little slip that goes with the dress w
2,these looked really interesting online and with the multicolor stripes i thought it would pair nicely with many tops the fabric is nice and sturdy the colors are more vibrant than online the design however is terrible when i put them on i double checked to make sure they werent on backwards the back is flat as a board but the front has these poofy pockets the poor fit with the bright stripes gives a s circus diaper look which is not good theyre also really tight compar
2,loved loved loved the shirt butthe material was so thin
2,issue which im facing is i have purchased this laptop on but on website i have checked the warranty is showing from till so please look into it kindly update my warranty period as per my purchased date i have attached pictures for your reference
2,the fabric felt cheap and i didnt find it to be a flattering top for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are
2,it really was not as good as i was hoping it would be turned out okay but not the best
2,i originally got these in a petite and thought they fit great right out of the bag im usually a and within an hour of wearing them to retailer actually the knees had gotten so baggy that they looked absolutely ridiculous ive never had jeans do this the salesperson at retailer agreed that they seemed very odd i exchanged for a p at her suggestion and i just hate them id say the smaller size seems every so slightly small but nothing major but the waist actually folds over a
2,i love the pattern adn color combo but wowt really flatering on me too much fabric i felt like i was trying to hide wight gain or pregnancy or wearing a mumu anyway not for me but others might toll wnat to try in case it was just me too bad length was decent in regulat size though not too long just too wide
2,laptop is good in all the condition but you have to compromise with the product quality because i purchased this laptop in but after months one key of the keybord is broken automatically which key is used rarely and also the plastic material on the laptop is not of a good quality you will see many scraches on your body after some time please donot buy this laptop
2,i loke the idea of this jacket but it was executed poorly it makes me look like a football player i am athletic build and i was swimming in the m i tried a small on in store and it still looked like i was wearing shoulder pads it hangs and gaps awkwardly the sleeves are freakishly long and the overall length was too short
2,so impressive and the starting episode is this good im very happy right now looking and waiting for the next episode thailand look so beautiful and the scenery and quality of scene look epic this season giving us many meaningful natural suspension evil spirit friendship emotional comedy jealousy everything perfect mike is one of the best director his creative writing skills everything out of this world hes definition of perfectionlove the vibe of this season the family look very distance everyone living in their own world and the three besties theyre story look very different from others
2,wanted to love this top and could imagine lots of outfits with it the wide shoulders made my armsshoulders look big the ruching and extra flap landed at an odd place accentuating my belly it did arrive very wrinkled although a previous reviewer said she found it to be a wrinkle free garment maybe that made the look worse overall i felt that it made me look lbs heavier than i am so back it goes i am lbs dddd and the size large was the correct size
2,poor taste compaired to other recipes
2,the first episode wasnt goodit was sloppy bulky slow it dragged murky and generally not a good pilotbut daaamn did it pick up really quick and i know the space visualhow space appears as ships move throughi know its a tribute to the star wars thing from way backi get thatbut its extremely bland and visually unmovingits not impressiveit looks fake theres an episode that has this background music that is supposed to cue you to laughor cue you that hey look this part here is supposed to be funnyjesus christplease stop thatdoes everything have to be dumbed down nowadays the attempt at comedy in most episodes falls shortthe action choreography and fight sequences are very bulky and not seamlessthat mando armour looks like it weighs a tonnot impressive at all the dialogue is lacklustrethe characters lack any flavourcase in pointhow they talkscruffy and groanyits a real turnoff for methis is more or less sort of a procedural type of showwhich means it is limited in scope and versatilityits a limited sloppy plottype in its defence thoughit really really tries to outgrow itselfbut theres just too much working against itthe runtime was a great ideawrap everything up in thirty minutes which helps the pacingbut it still cant help feeling like a generic actionflick wet dream
2,dont even waste your money even on sale bought three in different colors because i loved the loose fit and airyness for hot southern summers unfortunately one of them ripped in the first wash i let it air dry and thats when i found multiple runs and a hole that i could put my finger through one of the other colors was fine yet still pilled pretty bad the third one still has the tag keeping the one that survived the wash because i like the color but will only be using it as a knock
2,pretty design and good quality but the medium was very balloony at the bottom fit my chest alright c but flared out way too much at the bottom
2,laptop not on and ssd missing
2,cup size is really small for a medium no way to adjust the back strap ended up giving it to my daughter cute but so poorly executed
2,there have casual issues but more important to to down its rating that is the we can play some of video its screen is going in black then we can not going into back we need to shutdown directly through power off switch its too much fastrated me its not support videos hang on issue
2,i am sooooooo massively disappointed in this purchase i thought i had found the perfect pant in this style both more comfortable and more flattering than similar styles in the store i wanted to wear them every day received lots of compliments felt that you could dress up or down etc this is where i have to admit that i wore them several times straight from the store before washing on the second wear i noticed threads coming out on the seams but just on one side of one leg this was irr
2,very late to the party with this one partly as we didnt have paramount until fairly recently partly as i wasnt entirely sure what the pretext to this show was that being said i am so glad that i was able to catch up with this minutes into the pilot i knew this was going to be great the cast the writing the music and the scenery omg the scenery montana is so beautiful absolutely breathtaking the story unfolds pretty steadily and flows along at a good pace each episode flys by so quickly and leaves you wanting more lots more i binge watched yellowstone at every available opportunity and before i knew it i was done i cannot wait until the new episodes are released and i cannot recommend this enough
2,first episodes and i can barely stay awake the story is non existent only eye candy why was that large creature there what are they doing why is that thing half robot half alive no explanation just empty cheesy eye candy season was good it seems like they totally forget what made the first good now it is in line with the latest awful ray trilogy i gave it five stars for the first season and for the third now that is five they should have finished after season one or it should have been an anthology every season different character if you thought second season was bad well this is worse
2,this is what i was hoping for when first hearing about the star wars shows on disney after suffering through the horrible storylines dialogue and acting on the mandalorian book of boba fett and obiwan kenobi although i liked ewan mcgregor ive finally been rewarded with a noncheesy plot intelligent dialogue and capable actors this is the first disney series that i didnt have to force myself to finishincluding the marvel ones i actually looked forward to watching each new episode rather than just trudging through them out of a sense of duty to the franchises well done tony gilroy
2,when i wore this the two times i did i got a ton of compliments it runs small and is a bit tight when sized correctly but its really stunning after the second wear the fabric under the arms frayed and its now unwearable i have to return it and am so disappointed sadly i would not recommend buying it for that reason
2,i agree with other reviewers it is beautiful but too tight around the chest i am usually an xsmall and the xsmall was tight in the chest i bought the small and it was still uncomfortable sadly i had to return it i am lbs and a c by no means i am considered big chested so this is highly unusual
2,this top did nothing for me it billowed in the front and was not flattering for reference i am pounds and small chested i ordered the smallest size the top came in cannot recall if it was an xs or i promptly returned it
2,peaky blinders has it all crime violence intrigue strategy history politics and more and it blends them all into a fascinating and gripping story flawlessly it hooks you from the first minute of the first episode and the actors are brilliant in their roles it was so real emotional intense and sadist at the same time overall this is an adult series with a lot of darkness serious matter political agendas this show is fokin brilliant do not give up on this show
2,i am a curvy girl and bought these jeans in a size i dont have stick legs and the jeans have worn right through were my thighs rub together with the old pilcro material this did not happen this is a super soft jean and although the fit was good they just didnt last
2,i love everything by cloth stone so was excited to see that they made a dress hooray i ordered it in the xl which is my usual size in their shirts when i tried it on i was so sad to see that it barely fit around my tummy and hips i am a true size and the xl just barely gave me enough room to move my chest also caused the dreaded button gape it is clear that they cut the dress for people with a stick straight figure so disappointing
2,nice fabric great color would be lovely on someone with a straightandnarrow body type for ladies with curves take a passtoo much like maternity wear and not in that elegantly slouchy kind of way the straightup is she or isnt she kind of way
2,i was so looking forward to wearing these pants on an upcoming trip i already had my outfits planned when these pants arrived however they were very different from those shown in the pictures online firstly the pants are in actuality quite cropped i am the model in the pictures is at least that height if not taller and the hems were several inches above my ankles secondly the pants appear to be an even wider cut than whats shown although the width of the pant legs may have
2,i want to love this shirt i really do but its huge the top is tentlike which would be adorable with skinny jeans however the length of the back dips so low the top kind of reminds me of pajamas the color is beautiful more like a light grey heather and the white piping is like a shimmery ribbon material overall the top is cute but it dips too low in the back and the bow weighs down the back of the shirt so it makes it hard to adjust it in the front sadly its a return
2,love this dress wore it last night for a musical event came home and put it on the hand wash setting in the washer with cold waterjust as the label states pulled the dress out and guess what the design is completely faded it looks years old so sad im going to call retailer and ask for a refund i live two hours away
2,i love these pants bought them in both black and burgundy but the burgundy pair split in the butt before i even made it to work in the morning they werent even tight so disappointing i will be returning them
2,worst battery backup lasts in only maximum hr
2,this is a great top but it is really big i have a similar top from the same brand and the size small fits as expected this top is easily inches wider everywhere i would love to exchange it for an extra small but am afraid that even that size would be too large the blue pattern is beautiful and the fabric is light and airy which is perfect for warm days but the size issue is out of control
2,i was not a fan of these leggings these were very unflattering i could see that after wearing these all day they could start stretch out i just didnt feel like they would hold up for even one season
2,rogue one is one of my favorite star wars movies when i first watched it i found cassian andor a very interesting character and i always wanted to learn more about him because he is one of the most important resistance faces then series andor came and my wish came true andor is a very good series episodes full of action that never get you bored the last episode was the best it contains all the fighting resistance spirit all cast was very good but diego luna is incredible i think this role suits perfectly to him i am looking forward to watch season especially after this credit scene
2,i really wanted to love this shirt the snowflake and stripe design is really cute and the fabric is of nice quality its a very loose fit which i wouldve been willing to work with but as mentioned in previous reviews the shoulder seam rests in an odd place on your upper arm and there are little bumps in the fabric on the arms that appear similar to what happens if you leave a shirt on a wire hanger too long it looks like you have nubby little wings coming out of your arms not attrac
2,i wanted this skirt to work it is soft comfortable and cute unfortunately it runs to short i am and would not be able to pull it off at work i ordered a bigger size and it still didnt work
2,i am lbs pearshaped i ordered the s and it fit perfectly just skimming the floor the material is a beautiful gauzy metallic material that is lightweight with a beautiful drape and wonderful sorbetinspired colors the waistband is elasticized but not elastic and there is no unflattering poofing which can happen with skirts like this the flaw however is in the decision to only halfline this skirt with an offwhite jersey material the halflining isnt horrible but i found it
2,i love the pilcro serif legging jeans but these were a big disappointment if you have any thigh at all dont bother
2,i thought this dress looked gorgeous on the model so floaty and light when it came i found it to be the exact opposite the hem is so heavy and laid on me like a potato sack it had way too much material at the bottom and weighed me down unfortunately
2,we just didnt care for the taste with the cream of mushroom soup it was just weird way to much work for something thats edible but not worth making agian
2,this shirt ran small and was more sheer than i expected had to send it back
2,poor quality i expected much more from the material
2,i wanted to love this dress however it has no shape to it it is also somewhat see through so something needs to be worn under it i feel like i received a dress that has been stretched out and returned im extremely disappointed i do not recommend
2,i liked the design and i didnt mind that is see through but i couldnt put it on not size what is my usual size not size or even my shoulders wouldnt go through the middle part and it is not stretchy so disappointed i really wanted to like it
2,so much heating problem in day one after using few minuets only they become heat and sound also came battery life is very poor gave only to hour backup after fully charged
2,this dress was my absolute favorite recent retailer purchase the fit is so flattering i think this dress runs true to sizei usually wear a size in hd in paris and thats what size i ordered i expect i could have fit in a but the is comfortable i am but i ordered the regular length and it hit just above the knee i agree that it could use pockets but no need for lining however i just laundered this dress for the first timehand wash lay flat to dry as recommended and this dr
2,the zipper broke on this piece the first time i wore it very disappointing since i love the design im actually going to try to replace the zipper myself with something stronger but annoying that its come to that
2,the first two seasons of white lotus were absolutely brilliant every episode brought a wittiness that was sometimes shocking and refreshing at the same time considering the bs that is pumped out on the multitude of channels that exist these days so of course i was very pleased that there would be in fact a season well i have just finished episode and not only has the plane not left the airport but i really dont know where the destination is and the writers of this season have not written well enough for me to even care as with the previous seasons the cinematography is of the highest order very artsy and a joy to see but the story line and the characters suck in season
2,i had great fun in the beginning of the series the morbid humor was addams familylike the world was intriguing and the characters were well casted especially jenna ortega as wednesday only gomez addams seemed a bit off however the last episodes were a dissapointment the great finale was full of illogical behaviour that should have killed wednesday at least five times and predictably boring it was unoriginal to the point where it seemed like a harry potter knock off especially the black magic that was going on at the and seemed highly unfitting the series surely has a lot of good reviews because a lot of scenes look great for standing for themselves but if you are looking for an original story that will keep you invested until the end you are wrong here
2,i had been waiting for this skirt to go on sale as i fell in love with the style and print on the website however after receiving it in the mail i was disappointed to find that the cut was all wrong for my body type i am size hourglassathletic the xs was too big and made me look like i had no shape would be cute on a girl with no hipsbooty but unflattering on hourglass figure
2,i bought this shirt immediately because of the pattern when it arrived i was super confused its not a tee shirt like it looks like in the photos its made with cotton fabric with a tiny bit of stretch i ordered the xl because i have brought shoulders and e bras size and it fits like a x or larger i would say order two sizes down also it hangs like a maternity shirt i might order it once its on sale which it definitely will be but even then am not positive i would keep it
2,im so upset that this didnt work out im petite at and ordered this skirt in petite however i felt like it swallowed me up the fabric is thick and warm so this is definitely only cold weather attire im the picture it looks like there is a little leg showing but on me i feel like a schoolmarm sadly this is going back
2,i thought i would give this shower gel a whirl as always looking to try out new ones friend had said it had been good for their skin so thought i would give it a whirl the scent is hardly there at all it doesnut last like i expected and as such doesnut allow me to feel like ium using anything i prefer when the scent lasts through the day as others do that being said it serves it purpose as a soap but i would not buy it again unless there were many other options not available this review was collected as part of a promotion
2,i totally agree with the last reviewer im pounds with somewhat wide shoulders the xsmall fit my torso but was so tight in my shoulders i couldnt move my arms the small was better but was too big in the torso the material itself was really nice too bad the fit was so awkward and unflattering
2,i have blazers in size from this designer and they fit with room to spare i understand this is a more fitted style but it is still way too small size and size were not much bigger great colors and cute design but just too small even if you do not plan on buttoning it i hope they bring back this jacket but make it true to size
2,i looked at this dress for a long time before i purchased it because of the money i wear a size p was entirely disappointed in the style and construction of this dress for one thing the lining is bulky and you could never wear it in warmer weather without burning up the dress as pictured looks very feminine and light weight silk but there is just too much material going on thick and heavy the overall fit was too big and very unflattering
2,the order of the recipe didnt make sense and would be more difficult for a novice cook to follow than it should i would melt butter then add veggies and flour to cook add broth and allow to simmer it definitely needs salt and pepper and maybe something else cups of wild rice is too much try cups omit the wine just use broth this recipe just needed to be simplified and add some salt and its good i made all those changes and its much better
2,very bad laptop gb ram i dont buy build quality is very bad
2,this tank is not very flattering there is a lot of fabric its very boxy the holes kind of remind me of a high school basketball jersey i even sized down and its still just wide im returning
2,witty addictive hilarious and a bit dark the white lotus is truly modern day satire at its finest if you dont like or understand satirical comedy you will probably hate watching it i loved this show very well written and executed so much fun to watch definitely weird and eccentric but also incredibly woke without feeling forced i find that people who dont enjoy satire usually just dont get it and theyre whats being made fun of so of course they cant dont appreciate it this series is very specific to current times and they did an excellent job of depicting realistic people of different ages generations and races ethnicities relating to relevant themes of today this show is relatable for many reasons and for many different types of people they added just enough general comedy and drama theres a little bit of a mystery that leads to a twist at the end the pacing was surprisingly perfect i thought for sure the end would seem rushed because its such a short limited series with many different story lines and main characters i kind of wish it went on a little bit longer because i feel like certain storylines and characters could have should have been developed more and i would have liked to see that
2,this top is gorgeous and i exchanged it times hoping it would work i originally got the size a would normally wear a and the arm holes and top were extremely tight and the top was short so i sized up and still had the same problem i then went all the way up to a size in order to get the length of the shirt log enough but now it is quite large around my hips i love the detailing of the shirt but unfortunately if you have any chest at all it will not fit
2,i wanted to love this top perfect weight length and shape unfortunately the seam goes right through the bust and just does not look right if you are tiny on top this will be lovely on you
2,henry cavill is magnetic the production design is awe inspiring and figuring out the storyline like a puzzle was incredibly satisfying i hope this runs a full seasons
2,the black and white photo of this sweater makes it look absolutely beautiful the color photography looked to be a beautiful rich burnt red color it simply did not match it was more of an almost faded version of the rich color the fit was ok just didnt love it
2,i agree with other reviewer the material of these jeans is not the same thin stretches and you end up pulling them up all the time i am a short curvy girl and would love to have the old jean fabric back this seems to be the trend in jeansnydj also uses this fabricstretches too much
2,i loved the way this shirt looked when i tried it on in the store buto when i got home i realized its extremely sheer you cant wear a white bra with it for example because it will show through taking it back
2,its going back because it doesnt meet spectested with htestw write speed is only mbs read speed is good at mbs although sandisk claims up to mbsmeanwhile a class gb transcend sd card i have writes at and reads at i also have a few class gb sandisk microsd cards writing at and reading speed is and i also have a class kingston card that beats this class sandisk
2,this recipe was not terrible however i do not care to make it again the family did not care for the recipe either
2,superb acting from all very well filmed and an interesting plot with both humour thrills and the unexpected plenty to keep you entertained very rarely do i blitz a series but this one i was intrigued all the way and watched the whole series in days im not an adams family fanatic so have nothing to compare or contrast to but equally if youre an adams novice like me dont let it put you off watching as this is super easy to follow from the off im sure ive missed loads of connections to the original but hey sit back and enjoy eps back to back and it will defo keep you entertained
2,like others i finally received my size p black pants after months of waiting for starters these pants run small so i ordered a size up but still in petite because i adored the red ones i got this past summer when the black pants arrived they were a full three inches shorter than the red ones which were also p and the fabric did not feel anywhere close to the same quality im debating ordering the regular length but im not sure ill bother based on some of the other reviews
2,reacher is different from the films he is big and intimidating he beats up the bad guys to pulp there is no need to sweat over the plot twists as reacher is there to bulldoze through all its been a long time since there is this guy in a series and its refreshing
2,i wanted to love this dress the material is beautiful but sadly i agree with other reviewer the model definitely has this pinned back i am on the small side lbs straight figure very tiny girls and this dress looked awful totally swallowed what little shape i have and the swing did make me look prego in front and back the fabric is stiff so i think that adds to the sticking out oddly as far as sizing the arm jokes fit great xs ordered and length was good but wish the swin
2,my system is with in over heat the system please resolve the problem
2,horrible recipe the sauce was a stark white tasteless paste that no amount of doctoring after the fact could resolve a total waste of ingredients and home made pie crust a much better option is to make your chicken stock or use storebought stock and thicken it using tbsp cornstarch mixed with cup cold water and simmer until it thickens before adding the chicken and vegetables that way you still have chicken gravy not flour gravy
2,i am typically a small in dresses but i should have gone with the other reviewers and sized down it had no shape but hung like a paper sack the armholes fit perfectly though if i had sized down they may have been too tight i am lb i will return too bad because it is a pretty dress
2,season one was good some of the best star wars season two is a spectacular work of art it is the best star wars ever made rogue one was always my favorite movie andor season two has topped it the way the writers laid the story is amazing the way it lays out the political intrigue of the empire is amazing then the music it is spectacular also my only complaint is in episodes its over if disney follows this play book they will redeem theirselves and return to glory the only thing that will hurt andor season two is five years is disney garbage they keeps people from giving it a try
2,mine came out super liquidity and my apples were still crunchy i have to bake it again the flavor was okay
2,i loved these and wore them once i bought the red ones and the stained my furniture and my shirt so i washed them a few times in hopes of getting out all the extra dye ruined yet another chair so annoyed i loved them but they are not worth it
2,as a huge fan of not only the addams family but tim burton as well this show exceeded my expectations i binge watched the entire season in one evening couldnt stop watching i honestly feel like those who complained about it being too far from the original addams family missed the entire point of it being a coming of ageteenage progression its not a remake its not even a sequel to the old movies it is its own entity shows the maturity of wednesday and her coming in to her own also those complaining about the casting especially with gomez obviously arent familiar with the original comics the show was based on to begin with the casting was actually pretty spot on with its own original flair added tim burton has always been imaginative creative and a visionary and wednesday is no exception fingers crossed for a second season
2,the length of this dress is bizarre i cant decide if its supposed to lay on the floor or not touch it at all im not sure if i like it either way also at this price point i would have hoped to have the included under layer to not be so transparent if you buy this dress be prepared to invest in a slip and then have the slip tailored to match the high low hem line so that people cannot see your underwear the netting and details in this dress are beautiful but delicate the one i pur
2,i really wanted to like this its soft and cozy and a nice shade of blue but thats where the positives end i ordered the xs and it was huge wide shapeless and way too long im lbs and even if it came in petite im not sure its worth the price because i can imagine the thin material losing its shape and getting stretched out
2,overly complicated for people who dont have a prior knowlodge ablot the witcher universe the main story doesnt really live up to the expectation the whole show actually feels like a compliation of side quests that are in the game not a bad show tho somewhat entertaining if you have spare time
2,simple c program not run this laptop iam really unsatisfied i still had to take a good graphics card laptop wast of money
2,i wanted to love this shirt its not my usual style buy it looked so great online unfortunately the actual shirt is much more brown in color and design than i thought looking online im fair coloring it just wasnt flattering im thin but have a larger chest and this style just wasnt right for me could definitely be cute on someone else but not a good match for me
2,i was working with a three of these cards using the included adapter and thought they were slower than they should be i just bought a full size sandisk ultra gb class all the same specs except size theoretically for a different project and it writes over twice as fast on the same computer the write speed on this card is between and mbs the read seems to be mbs compared to the full size card with write speed of to mbs and a read speed of mbs this is from an imaging program not a benchmark program so its not checking different sizes of transfer and the like compare that with a transcend gb class card the write speed is nearly identical to mbs while the read speed on the class four is to mbs significantly slower as expectedthe read speed is good but the write speed is abysmal if it says class it should be somewhat close to the class specim returning them
2,i like the performance and the look of the laptop but the battery drains so fast and the laptop is heating up so easily so i will give it stars for the money and the looks of it but the rest is just okaish
2,i refuse to waste anymore time on this show by writing a lengthy review so i will accomplish what this show couldnt brevity
2,best series ever watchedabsolutely a master plan
2,this product is worst and not working properly
2,reacher didnt disappoint i went in with low expectations surprisingly i actually loved it it reminded of show criminal minds the plot and reacher roscoe sense of humor was exciting im hoping to see more of reacher thanks prime video
2,overheating issue and battery drain too early
2,i see all the amazing reviews and on one hand i agree with them but these pants do run huge and they dont fit tailored like on the model on me they fit loose around the legs and thighs and theyre super wrinkly youll have to iron these after every wear and every wash im surprised to see the comment saying theyre wrinkle resistant they arent also the kahki is more grey which i dont love i got these on sale but even at i just cant justify keeping them theyre super comfy but
2,it is a beautiful sweater but it is cropped and boxy
2,wanted to love this i did love the color and thought the style would work for anyone but i tried it on and immediately took it off with a definite not keeping this the side zipper a complaint by many really made it uncomfortable also the detail under the bust would not lay flat and just looked odd loved the material and definitely the green print but i knew i would never wear it just looked blah
2,the top red is more like orange was disappointed and returned it
2,couldnt sleep so i turned on the tv looking for something interesting nothing really jumped out at me then i found reacher at first i thought it was a movie that had been out awhile and i had passed it up previously when i read the details of the movie i discovered it was new movie with actors i was not familiar with ended up binge watching the miniseries and throughly enjoyed it the plot is a familiar one but this was not a formula type movie script is fresh plot is exciting and the acting very good it is an action movie which isnt my favorite genre but i really loved this movie
2,way too longthe sizing is incredibly off on this product order a size or two down
2,i was so excited to try these on at my local retailer im so glad i did before i ordered them online because i found the fit to be totally off the pants bulged around my hips and looked very awkward they were also not as soft as i expected them to be
2,did not work for me material was a bit thin poor quality the tie doesnt quite work correctly had a cheaper look to it not the quality id normally expect this is going back
2,it is so cute in the picture but wasnt flattering on me it also felt like i couldnt raise my arms while wearing it i love retailer and will be a forever fan but this dress just wasnt for me
2,love the look of this and the fabric but runs way small i usually wear a ordered the then just got the and its still too small will be returning all
2,i thought i would love this shirt because it goes along with my style but i returned it immediately it runs so large the colors are faded and the trim of the shirt curl over so it looks cheap and frumpy i do not recommend this it hits in all the wrong places
2,good
2,it was okay but to sweet for my taste
2,things have not been great from the netflix camp of late so wasnt sure what to expect but have to say tim burtons wednesday has certainly given me hope that we may see some actual series worth watching on it once more it was funny emotional dark and really good fun lets hope tim burton stays on board for the nd series which there definitely will be but wont spoil things if mot watched it yet because i will definitely be watching it the actress who played wednesday was the perfect actress to play the part and the cgi for thing was just superb personally i dont think i would have picked catherine zeta jones as morticia but will let that slide because of everyone elses fantastic performances
2,based on the strength of the other reviews i thought this sweater would be amazing but i was disappointed the knit is very thin cheap looking and weak that it wont last a season undamaged it reminds me of a duster i bought years ago at a discount fastfashion retailer when i was a student sloppy looking with lots of creases out of the package collar is odd and the sleeve openings have an annoying flare the drape is not structured enougheverything about this screams over priced bath
2,it doesnt provide the correct storagethe laptop storage are very
2,recipe ingredient list does not include amount of chicken how many breasts
2,i bought this product on th september and now using this after the return policy date over the sound quality is very poor and bad not you can listen to a movie even in just front of display battery performance is also not good more details and review i will update after the month of using
2,i agree with all of the reviews the design and fit are wonderful if you can get it on the buttons are a nightmare whoever made these clesrly sewed the loopholes on the buttons closed with no thought as how to open them or get them off ridiculous they need to put a side zipper on this as i will probably check into since i really want to keep it so so so disappointing
2,this dress has a beautiful fabric i really hated to send it back it was just so unflattering absolutely no shape to it i bought a p im and lbs and it looked like a maternity dress on me
2,one of the best series with a tremendous production regarding footage art direction aspects like costume and wardrobe also the videography presents good image composition and editing works establishing that characteristic filter and memorable overall appearance its a pity but it falls short in scenery that is huge and rich idealistically but totally fake and poor visually the storytelling is super interesting and delivers lots of intelligent action criminal and military strategy twists surprises some history data all in a juicy setting conceiving substantial characters to which the actors gave life brilliantly first seasons are better in relation to script and content in the last ones it seems to be going round to keep walking and sometimes there is too much going on without satisfactory elucidation specially about the th and very last one there is a lot of over spicy dialogues in constrast with other very slow scenes super boring musical parts dreams and more dreams spiritual fantasies leading to a despicable or garbage end the daughter warning him from the beyond and the indiscreet coincidence of the partially burned newspaper in the ashes almost made worthless all the effort furthermore will the big philantropist for the working class bang the fascists when everythings wrapped up at the true final in such a movie to be released
2,battery low
2,i was so sad not to love this dress it is beautiful but is so unflattering on there is a lot of material under the arms and it gathers up due to the smocking so it just made me look incredibly frumpy i dont really think a petite would have helped the gathers just bunch a bit and so rather than hang the dress sort of clumps i am lean but broad shouldered and maybe that is the problem but i was super disappointed narrow shouldered people with long torsos could pull this off it is a t
2,i bought two as a back up for my gopro hero one from amazon the other was a gift from bbboth did not work in my cameras thinking it was gopros new updatekept getting a sderri returned other and it worked with no problemnote to all there are bootlegged products out there it is hard todetect but of all the items ive received from amazonprime and beyondhave been great i just got stuck with a bad batchgopro recommends hxhcxc and extreme micro cards
2,i ordered two gb and two gb versions of these memory cards but i can write only one review per amazon two gb cards went into a camera and a cell phone which only accept up to gb cards and one gb card went into my samsung galaxy s cell phone the second gb cards a sparethe galaxy s phone accepted the gb microsd card with no problems except for the fact that my galaxy s only recognizes gb of the gb microsd card i have no idea why it does that and why i lost over gb of an empty microsd card but im okay with that i guess gbs is still plenty the transfers of music videos and pictures between the phones internal gb memory and the gb microsd card is wayyy faster than the old sandisk gb microsd card that was in there the same noticeably faster speeds between my desktop computer and the gb microsd card were also smile inspiringas for the sandisk microsd cards they work great and seem to operate pretty darn fast theyre definitely faster than the old gb sandisk microsd cards i had installed in my camera and cell phonesnow as for the shipping dismal i ordered two gb along with two gb microsd cards on august during an amazon gold box sale according to the tracking feature they didnt even transmit the shipping info to the carrier usps until august all four were shipped together i didnt receive them until september a full days after i ordered a little over two weeks for four tiny items that were indicated on the amazon page as being in stock ships from and sold by amazoncom at the time of purchase they also shipped all four tiny microsd card packages in a way oversized box which the usps couldnt fit into the mailbox so i had to make a crosstown trip to the us post office and stand in a very long and slow moving line to pick up the box they could have all four easily fit in one small envelope even a small padded envelope i left packaging feedback on that alreadythis is the rd straight time that amazon shipping was horrible over the last several months and that is why the star rating this is not the amazon shipping that i remember
2,this item is huge im normally a medium sized down to a small still massive couldnt go too much smaller because the buttons would pull at the chest but the sleeves are very wide as is the waist way too much fabric i had high hopes for this one but it just doesnt work for reference i love billowy and flowy tops but this was a tent
2,i started this because of all the hype created the dark comedy factor is pathetic and definitely not worth watching its really slow and gets boring the so called suspense in the end is not worth waiting to watch all episodes all actors have acted great and that is why i have given four stars and not one star however show tries to describe all character with odd personalities and each one associated with their specific issues not common one hbo trying to bring all in one rich people happiness issue indigenous people affairs mental health after watching season definitely not going for season
2,beautiful dress but have to return way too big long for me medium is the size i wear but i think i would need an extra small
2,before doing research i assumed this card would support my brand new hero camera considering it was sold off the gopro site it was a no brainer or so i thoughtanyhow the card seems to preform well under most circumstances without using the protunes settings the problems with the hero where due to the slow write speed of this card under protunes settings without this setting the hero works finehowever after a few timelapse issues sec timelapse which is well in this cards speedsi noticed the card is corrupt i tested this in other cameras and found that this problem still persists i trust sandisk as my top choice for all my professional work however this card has failedi would not recommend this expensive card id jump for a samsung or even the transcend cards they even come with a better warranty then this cardnothing but problems and lost memories that i cant replace
2,i loved everything about this dress the fit the style and the ability to wear in the fall i wore it once washed it in gentlehandwash cycle in cold water and laid it out flat to dry per the instructions and it shrank at least a full size its going back i am so sad as i said earlier i really loved this dress
2,sorry but the lady who said its not new england is absolutely right half the ingredients in this recipe do not belong in a true ne clam chowder thyme chicken broth garlic bacon half
2,value for money
2,great actors excellent character development and an evolving story one of my favorites to watch currently it starts a little fast but slows down to allow characters to develop if youre a realist move on of the bad reviews here are related to cows dont do that or this character is unbelievable and it is frankly annoying go watch a documentary its a fictional story that is intended to be entertainment if i wanted reality id step outside and stare at a tree
2,did not squirt very well
2,worst ever experience in flipkartwhen the product was received at me everything looks greatbut when i started configuring an initial setup i found out that there is some problem in screen and one black horizontal line is visible as you can see in the screenshotso i thought that its better to replace this laptop with another one but as we all know the product value is one lakh so they have disabled the return option then i tried to contact customer care and they logged one ticket on my read more
2,sadly enough for season reacher seems to think the viewers are stupid or not able to think or make conclusions every time somebody gives info he describes the conclusion or idea in detail every timeconclusions most viewers should be able to detect themselves easily if paying attention to the series and having a minimum of logic deduction capabilities it seems they want the die to attract people who do not want to think when watching for those like myself who do want to put our brain at work it becomes almost a story of an insult and paternalistic worst of all it becomes really annoying besides that the action is not realistic it does not deserve an
2,the only reason i gave this stars is because the flavor of the sherry over powered the other tasty ingredients i feel as though using the chicken broth would have been a better choice for me will be trying again
2,i saw this dress and immediately started daydreaming about wearing it while honeymooning in italy along the amalfi coast or the cinque terre with my husband and then i tried this dress on and immediately woke up the cut is a disaster the quality is terrible and the dress just plain didnt work the strips of elastic were sewn unevenly giving the appearance that there was one large breast and one nonexistent breast the neckline was so long that it had to have the elastic run over the outsi
2,very nice plush but unfortunately no longer works after a monththe mechanism is not very reliablevery little used in additiondamage because we liked it well
2,i have used many laptops and pcs this type of performance i had never seen very laggy slow booting it has a gigs of ram and gb of ssd even it works worst than my pentium processor i would recommend to not buy thia laptop
2,i dont have a large head but i could barely squeeze this blouse over mine i also ordered the xs even though im usually a small and it was still blousier than i would have liked already returned it on the plus side its gorgeous
2,i loved this shirt so much i bought it in colors however two of them shrunk i was very disappointed
2,i ordered this sweater in the pink color in a small and xsmall in order to see which was the best fit i was really looking forward to getting it because it looked so great online like it had a nice flow the cute zipper and was a good match for a pink and grey skirt that i have i was really disappointed the sweater doesnt flow like it does in the picture it kind of billows out in the front and back and isnt flattering i have a small build and frankly i usually look good in sweaters
2,i love this brand and the material of these shirts and have a ton similar and thought this was adorable with the sweet detail but it is super short and boxy and i felt uncomfortable with the length on me and it also made it so it wasnt so flattering on such a bummer cuz its a sweet spin on a plain basic tee
2,i was really looking forward to these tees working after reading the reviews unfortunately they had slits on the sides that came up higher than i was comfortable showing my sides just above my jeans trying to keep it age appropriate
2,needs a thickening agent i let this pie sit for over a day and a half and it was still way too runny had a decent taste but the cinnamon and nutmeg was a bit over powering
2,i love the material on these shorts unfortunately thats all i love the fit is awkward and im an easy fit theyre boxy in the body legs and a bit tight in the waist causing me to not be sure whether to place the elastic waist higher or lower and neither one works well sadly couldnt keep these just for the pretty fabric
2,no no noi dont know if it was the way it got flattened out in the packaging or what but it sticks out like a tent from the hips down im about c usually wear a or in dresses this thing barely buttoned over my bust and then flares out to a tentlike triangular shape at the bottom i dont think it would come out by washing and ironing it im afraid it was just cut poorly i looked like a sad prisoner in stripes unfortunately i bought three different dresses in the
2,i loved the look of this sweater online but it just didnt work for me the fit wasnt good enough the style okay the color fine the feel scratchy overall it did not work for my body
2,this top was gorgeous and fit perfectly right out of the bag with only a quick ironing unfortunately the first time i washed it cold water hang dry it shrunk so that it no longer fits across the bust without tape where it was once roomy is much shorter and feels rougher to the touch like another reviewer said unfortunately after i had purchased and washed i wish the label would have just said to dry clean only because i regret washing it and would have done otherwise if i had kno
2,the blouse is lovely but after washing it exactly as specified it shrank more than a full size this is an expensive handmedown for my daughter
2,this dress was adorable fit great regrettably i had to return it since it wasnt lined
2,you think this cant really happen if you come from the third world like i do then you probably know that this on a much smaller scale is already happening do not take anything for granted other than that this is an incredible production with great acting watch it make a note of it
2,battery is very bad only hour run time
2,this dress had beautiful details and the material was better than i expected however it was huge it completed swallowed me i am about pounds with quite a bit of muscle i ordered a p and it still looked like a sack
2,runs large very boxy white fabric on lower portion of the shirt extremely thin it did not look as good as in in picture very disappointing
2,this dress is beautiful and unique the cutouts and lace really stand out however the dress was huge on me and that is rare with moulinette souers i usually get a or p in this brand due to the bust sizing being generally smaller but the regular was huge and the armholes really big the petite may have been better but felt that it would have been too short while the design is beautiful there were several areas on the dress where the threads were unraveling for reference i am waist
2,i wanted to love this as i love bright colored patterns however when i received the pattern was different than the one pictured and didnt appear as bright and the material was much different than i expected could almost see through the shirt where it is white and is very thin also i have a larger chest and a smaller waistline and the cut of the where the peplum began made me look larger than i actually am i am a ddd and i normally where a size medium a medium fit but like i said made
2,i ordered the black and white pattern which was ok i got a small but the shirt was very square with a short and wide fit i doubt an xs would have helped with such a boxy shirt sent this one back
2,the show is not terrible well a little terrible had this show not been under the addams family banner it might have just been another netflix series an okay watch my problem is that they and when i say they i mean tim burton took some iconic characters and distorted them into rather dull and dreary nobodies not the first time he has done so turning the charismatic willy wonka into a sinister creep i have no problem with the casting but where is the charisma the joy the wicked sense of humour that the addams family are known for they revel in the macabre the absurd i am sure that morticia and gomez probably would have chuckled at wednesdays antics not sent her to boarding school the show is way too serious it went from kooky to emo i am not saying dont watch the show you may like it it has some really good elements but it is not the addams
2,cute in theory i love the bright colors the tied black collar sash and the s vibe however the fabric is cheap and the worst part in my view is that the seams that run along the front center of the shirt do not align the pattern maybe this was intentional but with the shirt i received it looked horrible i sent it back i notice in the picture that the black ties are strategically placed over the center front seam so it is a bit deceiving i wouldnt buy this top at any price based on
2,i ordered not one but two sizes of this dress to try on and was hoping to ultimately wear to an event one petite one the style color and cut are all perfect one not so minor downfall however the zippers on both dresses were faulty they both broke in the same spot both during the first time just trying them on i cant get either of them to even budge now will either need to take back or get fixed very sad about this
2,this is way cuter on the model it runs so big that it is very unflattering perhaps on someone tall it would look better but sadly it looked dumpy on my frame it also arrived with some black stain on it it is going back
2,i love love love this print and had to have it when retailer had their off sale i think regular price is way too much for this dress as the dress isnt even silk or a better material but once i got this i was so disappointed i ordered my usual size and it was just a balloontent on me i felt like i was wearing a maternity dress plus the ruffle at the top which i thought was a sweet feature felt really awkward and like it was grazing my neck and chin in an annoying way i dont even want t
2,laptop good fod basic internet surfing and watching movies laptop build quality and keyboard very very poor front cameea doesnt have cover
2,the pattern and colors are very pretty and the material is soft and silky i returned it though because it is very lowcut in the front it comes down to between my breasts which is not going to work for me
2,the battery is so bad it drains out so quickly and the adapter tht i got is chicony idk if i cn get get another adapter or not after replacement this adapter get hot within just minutes of charging n tht too i dont use it while its on charge
2,this show is wildly popular with liberal coastal elites and those who admireimitate said elites the rest of us recognize this as a boring sloggy cinematically pretentious snooze but with season three they did make two big improvements first they didnt bring jennifer coolidge back her act was getting old and she was becoming a distraction from the story parker posey is hysterical and hopefully she can breathe some life into this zombie schlock fest the second is the location using thailand as a backdrop almost makes the show interesting but these improvements are cancelled out by the shows predilection for notalent nepo nonsense casting hollywood is well into its poop addiction phase see season and hopefully well be spared the indignity of watching conans son taking a dump at some point to mitigate the absence of storyentertainment fingers crossed
2,this romper fit like a dream it is gorgeous unique and sexy i am rating this stars because it took me minutes to try it on there is no zipper and the only way to get it on and off is by buttoning and unbuttoning the small buttons on the top nobodys got time for that i wanted so desperately to wear it to my friends th birthday party but i imagined myself spending half the night in the restroom trying to get this romper on and off no thank you i considered buying the romp
2,battery not so good
2,i was so excited to order this sweater i thought that the moss color would make it a great basic for work or casual days ordering it on sale made it all the better however when it came i was so sad to see how muted the colors were with little definition the sweater itself lacks definition as well just shapeless and hangy i also did not expect the angora like hair on the sweater which bothered by eyes as soon as i tried it on
2,i really wanted to like this dress but where the skirt meets the top of the dress in the back creates sort of a hunchback effect in the back will be returning
2,the sweater material was fragile there were already two picks in the fabric when it arrived i felt like it would not wear or wash well i was also disappointed in the shaping or how it hung on my body i am returning the sweater
2,back side cooling fan very loud noise coming
2,after exactly month and a half this card is doneand with it i lost all my pics and videosjust after the return policy expired card is not recognized by my phone or pc trying to get rma from sandiski own the s and have read extensive problems with the and gb card class samsung says is sandiskand sandisk says is the phone but ive seen other cards failing with different phones all android by the waywhats the problem
2,i saw this dress online and i thought it was perfectly cute however once i tried it on at home it just didnt work one of the buttons broke in half as i tried unbuttoning and once i got it on the dress was so small that the cuffs cut off circulation to my forearm im and lbs and purchased in size i didnt even try buttoning all the way i took it back and i dont even think i want a larger size the buttons are just too fragile
2,maybe i shouldnt have sized up to an xl but im not sure a smaller size would have solved the weird fit the vee is quite low and im busty itll be really low if youre smaller on top the fit from back to front where it ties looked horrible on me not tight at all its almost balloon like around the hem and from the side view i looked like a really wide green apple i hate leaving a bad review because i know someone may love it but i wouldnt recommend it
2,a brutal but beautiful view of a modern cowboyranching family kevin place an amazing patriarch to the dutton family and looks and walks talks just how i imagine a cowboy should but the real hero is beth what a mean hard soulless woman
2,a series with precise actors i enjoyed every moment
2,the otter looks very cute the little night light on his belly is practical for the night and as a music box i find it not bad because the melodies are very nice and soothinghowever i bought it first of all because i thought that these breathing noises and lifting and lowering of the belly could be calming and helping to fall asleepmy child months first laughed and then she found it kind of stupidthe engine is very loud because you dont hear the rest of the noises well anymore unless you set the volume relatively high my personal opinion is that this part is not so helpful in sleep problems
2,this is rated good grief are you kidding me season has to be one of the most boring things ive ever watched granted i am sticking with it til the end but wow it goes nowhere and is slower than molasses this makes severance which i do like look like an action movie characters on this show have any redeeming qualities the guard the massage therapist the daughter exploring buddhism the british gal everyone else in this show exhibit the worst of human qualities i find it disturbing that this is one of the biggest shows on tv i will say that through the entire third season there was one good line parker poseys maybe jesus will save her from those buddhists hilarious line but the rest of this i have to ask myself why am i watching this garbage the first seasons were better by leaps and bounds i will say that the cinematography is really good and the soundtrack that people have griped about is really pretty interesting to listen to very unique the rest of it blech
2,loved the open shoulders but not how large and flowy the rest of it was i could have worn it months preggo
2,sandisk quality has failed me moving on to another brand ive had three of these memory cards fail on me in very short order
2,i ordered this online and took it back the day i got it i could not fit the neck hole over my head therefore i couldnt even see how it truly fit i had high hopes for this dress
2,this looks great on the model but when it arrived i couldnt believe it was the same jacket it looks a bit like a really loose garbage bag on me and no amount of adjusting drawstrings is going to fix it i really wanted to like it but even the xss was too baggy also a bit worried based on other reviews that it isnt actually a rain jacket and wont keep you dry
2,i bought two of these memory cards for use with my logitech alert e outdoor master security cameras so far i have found them to be unreliable i am not entirely certain if this is because of the camera system or the memory card themselves the camera frequently will report a memory card error that indicates the card has to be reformatted this is problematic as if the camera had recorded something that was important the failure of the sd card would be very troublesome indeed
2,this top is absolutely gorgeous but i followed the care tag to a t and it completely fell apart in the wash will be returning
2,i ordered the orange in size xl the fit on me matches the model other than being a little shorter in length the quality is bad i ordered two of these sweaters and both arrived new in the packages with one having a small hole the knit is so thin as is the base material the arms are basically seethrough it doesnt offer any warmth because of the thinness i layered a longsleeved white tee underneath which helped the edge of the sleeves stretched out within an hour i also had two area
2,this is my review on the last of us first of all i love the show it gets confusing at first if youre coming from a game but cast is amazing pedro pascal is the best joel for the show also acting of bella ramsey stunned me she went from badass to soft like clicks cast and crew for me is top tier plot is amazing whole setup and cgi is amazing i havent completed the show yet im in watch full and half th episode but so far the show is doing a great job as i said it gets confusing if youre coming from a game but so far this is by far the best show ever coming off of a game
2,such a low quality laptopafter one month power button is not working properly please dont buy this laptop pls trust me dont buy this laptop
2,over heating slow processing
2,i wanted to just love this show but i didnt it wasnt bad i think i just couldnt get past the misrepresentation of modern teenagers i felt there was a disconnect anyways i loved jennifer coolidge she was great at playing her character it felt so natural to watch her be awkward and cringy it was interesting watching something where it felt like nothing is going right not many shows are like that if youre looking for a good watch i recommend this
2,i was aware of the split sleeves when i purchased hoping to try something new theyre not attractive the slit stays open with any movement i dont think it would be appropriate for work overall the fit is true to size i otherwise liked the design but the sleeves made this a quick return
2,a simple minded and vacuous plot of the unhappy rich folks none of whom deserves much and the only character with a conscience and positive spirit is the spa manager watch if you enjoy train wrecks
2,i saw this dress online and really wanted to love it unfortunately it wasnt at all as expected in person as the previous reviewer mentioned it is extremely itchy material which was already pilling on many of the dresses displayed in the store the neck was extremely tight a problem ive never encountered with any retailer dress additionally it seems to have a kangaroo pocket located right underneath the bust line which protruded in an unflattering way the pocket is not at all not
2,this top is beautiful even more so in person however like a previous reviewer the fit is very boxy there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you cant see in the photos due to the models cardigan and arms if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted without all the excess fabric at the bottom it would have been perfect again the color the lace the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came
2,this sweater looked so promising with the tie waist and pretty lacy edging but turned out to be a disappointment it was much shorter than it looks in the photos and barely came to my hips and the plum color was much darker than i expected more of a dull brownishburgundy
2,when i saw this item online i ordered it right away loved the color and the oversized comfy look to it the pros very softthe color a deep cranberry as pictured the cons the low back in the photo the models arms cover it up when i put it on it looked like an oversized flap that stuck out on the sides and was very visible from the front and because the material is unstructured that made it look worse i loved it except for this one feature but because it was so detracting i had
2,i bought a size small in this dress even though i am usually a large at retailer it just hung strangely and clung to the unflattering parts of my body but seemed very large i loved the feel color grey and style of the dress but i ended up returning it because of the fit it also requires something under it since it is fairly seethrough
2,battery full heating battery problem
2,i purchased this sweater in a small nothing on the web site states it has dolman sleeves it looked sloppy and made my bust disappear it went back i hate dolman sleeves
2,ill start by saying the fabric and concept are beautiful the top is sheer but thats pretty clear in the images and not surprising for a lightweight white blouse the problem is that the arms are more fitted and the torso not the chest but the midsection is cut fairly wide im b and usually wear a or a smallmedium depending on how relaxed i want the fit i purchased this in a the arms were workable but slightly fitted and the torso fit like an chest was as expect
2,the designshape of the dress are quite flattering flirty and feminine but there is no way that the dress i received is new the color is a faded washed out red and there are black stains all over the belt area there is no tag the fabric looks droopy and laundered and is not crisp stiff or new i am very disappointed by the quality of the item that i received undoubtedly this one is going back dear retailer please make sure that you do not send preowend clothing articles to
2,i loved the fact that this dress is cotton it is a thin cotton and you can see in the photos that she is wearing a black slip with a thicker strap mine came with a nude slip im thinking they all come with a nude slip im not sure why they showed the dress with the black thick strap slip unless it was to show the dress as a thicker cotton than what it actually is the dress is adorable though which makes it hard for me to decide whether to keep it and hope mine wont tear easily or to retur
2,camera poor
2,proformance is not good
2,i really love the pattern and the look on the model and i thought i would love it i ordered online so i did not try on in store when i tried it on it has way too much fabric around the waist and skirt it is thick fabric as well and has a lining and the waist has extra fabric for the design and it has pockets so it all adds up to be way too bulky it is not flattering at all and made me look pounds heavier i am returning this dress sad because it looks so lovely on the model i am
2,this shirt runs very large i will be returning for a smaller size
2,i bought this online in the grey and blue and had high hopes it runs big so size down at least sizes i didnt realize that the sweater looking part on the forearms was part of the coat that part of the coat is really nice and comfy unfortunately the rest of the coat the wool part is very itchy it wouldve been awesome if it was lined on the inside but its notso im taking them back
2,appears much more sleek in the photograph in real life this shirt looks more like a pajama top thin extremely casual not worth the price i paid even in black will be exchanging it tomorrow
2,bringing more western and samurai tropes to the space opera whod a thunk that we would be able to empathize with a character with a completely masked face
2,dont buy display bleeding problem
2,we found this to be bland and rather dry especially with next day leftovers its a time consuming recipe but its just okay tasting and not worth the effort as is i added garlic cloves and some salt and pepper to the hamburger while cooking it but that extra seasoning didnt go far enough to make this have real flavor if you like plain food then youd like this but if i were to make it again i would use spaghetti sauce rather than diced tomatoes for sure the casserole doesnt really have any sauce to it and the shredded cheese disappears when you bake the casserole leaving you with layers of dry spaghetti noodles with some bits of diced tomato there are other spaghetti casserole recipes i would try here before this one its really not that good
2,for the model to look like this pros nice quality the colors of the blue version at least are rich and beautiful note that the dark color pictured is really brown not black the colors are also much brighter than they appear in the picture it is a medium to heavy weight sweater knit which is well suited for fallwinter it is layered over a bright navy poly slip cons i am i looked like i was wearing a circus tent in med the sleeves were more dolman than fitted i imagin
2,way to sweet for me the cornstarch and sugar overpowered the apples
2,i followed the instructions exactly and baked for even longer than the recipe said the video says the written recipe says i did it was brown on top i took it out cooled it put on the glaze and cut it it was still raw im baking it again but it is probably ruined since it already glazed havent even gotten to taste it
2,very easy directions and a simple pie but the pie was a little too eggy for me it wasnt very appealing when i sliced it the pie looked more like scrambled egg than a cheesecake mixture
2,i grabbed this dress to try on in my usual size because i needed to see what the hype was about this style of dress and it left me puzzled the print was pretty but no amount of tailoring could save it for me it was wearing me maybe it could wear three of me i feel like this is a way for clothing manufacturers to cut corners by making a garment without details no installing more time consuming zippers buttons or snaps and making something that fits a wide range of sizes because it
2,material is hard to wear a bra under it
2,unfortunately the dress is pulling apart after the first wash gentle hand wash cycle also there are no brastraps holders and my bra straps did show up a lot
2,it is an used product it doesnt works properly i needed a service to use battery life is too short when compared to the given specification suddenly it turn off itself when using for more than an hour
2,disney absolutely blew it with the skywalker saga thankfully their side stories have been mostly solid without spoiling anything i will say this show does a fantastic job of telling its own story while providing plenty of fan service and i mean good fan service and remaining true to the real star wars universe absolutely love the show and cannot wait for more kathleen kennedy ryan johnson and jj abrams better start taking notes
2,these would have been the perfect black pants great cut love the wide band in the front true to size quality construction but a zipper in the back i had to ask my husband to help me zip them up perhaps they would be easier to put on if my bum were a little smaller but the pants fit perfectly they were just too hard to put on sending them back since i dont have an assistant to zip them up whenever i need
2,the design of these ankles pants is very cool and the rise is perfect however the fabric despite spandex has absolutely no give from the knee down the extensive stitching probably contributes to the lack of stretch while i was able to pull them on size for lb i could not bend my legs at the knee comfortably with longer wear i think they would cut off the circulation please post if these stretch for you enough with wear and become softer
2,i ordered this card as part of a lighning deal back in november the card was working fine in my galaxy s until a few weeks ago where it would intermittently not be recognized by my phone or my desktop computer and today months later it died completely i guess you really do get what you pay for
2,worked great for about six months in my s and last week it started having device connectivity issues the phone keeps saying ad card removed resetting the phone lets the memory card work for maybe minutes very frustratingi have gigs of media i would appreciate scan disk resolving this issue with me and the product
2,it has excellent writeups so ive given it a few goes i really cannot see why it is grindingly slow somebody explain why the good reviews im clearly missing something
2,my laprop camera not working and battery backup average
2,display is not comfortable with eyes it should have ips display system
2,not ok with gopro hero black edition the speed of this card is below other brands class standard when i use this card with gopro and protune on it will stop recording after mins or so i already returned this item and bought the samsung class memory card instead
2,money wais
2,i had really been hoping to enjoy this more an addams family related property in the hands of tim burton how could it not be amazing well unfortunately it was very underwhelming overall look is pretty good actors are all pretty good but the script was maybenot what it could have been honestly not surprised i later found the writers also worked on smallville and the level of quasi teenhigh schoolish drama is sort of understandable once i learned that it doesnt make it great it makes the character of wednesday feel less like an addams though and more like a teeny bopper detective i would recommend trying it if you havent i was really wanting to like it more for the as already mentioned addams family connection and tim burton in directors chair i couldnt make it past the first episode but dont let that discourage you even though it wasnt for me it looks like it definitely is finding traction so id say worth trying at least was really hoping to at least make it to that dance scene that looked great on the youtube clips
2,products sold in flipkart are not genuine worst laptop issues were started with laptop right from day usage issues with usb port bluetooth connectivity etc
2,i had high hopes for this top but once again it is just a big boxy too much material top i get the style but if it adds lbs to your middle area its not for me it is a thin material so it does hang nice
2,i was expecting elbowtofulllength sleeves and like a previous review noted they were short very weird look for a wrap returned
2,i thought this skirt would fit just over the knee with a nice flowy build instead it fit rather baggy and was longer than i expected i felt dowdy in it
2,battery performance is extremely poor received laptop in bad shape it was deformed however after pressing the cover all went fine
2,i was very excited to add this memory card to my g and finally not have to worry about used up memory anymore this was short lived however as maybe a few months had passed when the memory card refused to write anymore data i tried formatting it never could wipe it using it in a thumb drive reader kwpould not delete data all to no avail luckily the data i had on it was still salvageable
2,i love the idea of this top but wish there wasnt so much fabric i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are
2,no keyboard light
2,this recipe was not to my liking i found it to be overly sweet and i did not care for the crisp part it was not crispy enough
2,although the story was great and the acting was okay but it wasnt the addams family the story was far too serious and lacked most all of the kookiness five episodes in and im wondering what happened to the real wednesday the fellow that played gomez was terrible for the part pugsley and morticia were vague shadows of the characters they once were i feel it was a let down as an addams family spinoff although as its own show it wouldve been great so imagine children of today would enjoy it but the children of yesteryear are just glad to feel the nostalgia of watching something old being brought back
2,pretty color but i was hoping for a thicker higher quality material for the price the material is lightweight and isnt tailored well looks kind of sloppy
2,stopped working and could not reformat didnt have good luck with this item or the vendor selling this item hopefully just a bad onesandisk is usually pretty good
2,was excited to receive this dress as i got it at a great price on sale the colors are great and it fits pretty good but it came without a slip so disappointing to not receive the entire dress hence the stars may send it back for this reason
2,ive seen this described as the best star wars series and what star wars should be lets look at what it is a story about how the rebellion raised funds the prequel to a previous prequelrogue one is it necessary in the star wars lore no is the story original no pretty much a heist in space with no pivotal alien characters thats about the bones of it the acting is good but its not enough to save a fairly boring story there is none of the charm of the original movies nor any major characters youre rooting for if you want to compare it other scifi thats out there one word severance now there is an original exciting series with great characters
2,watching the last episode had to take a break the writing is so sloppy and so so bad so predictable very disappointed in favreau and his team sometimes i wonder if they got their children to write the script almost every scene i find myself bewildered at why characters arent using what little brain cells they have other than bo katan there is no character development its more like character deterioration even bo katans story is very weak and feels forced at times the choreography is also terrible throughout the season they are very fortunate to have an endless budget that gave us stunning visuals because theres not much else to praise this season after this season im left feeling as though they stopped caring and started collected the paycheques still cant believe how much worse this season is compared to ss s s s would be much lower without the beautiful visuals
2,i cant believe you cant unscrew the top to get to the last of the lotion i have of lotion in the bottle that i cant get to what a waste of money will be switching body lotions with my next purchase
2,but common human citizens can be all races for sure but i havnt ever seen a black skinned elf same would go for dwarves etc but all american moviesseries are unfortunatelly same please for god sake dont mix your propaganda with fantasy genre
2,the story is great the execution is okay and the dialogue is bad its predictable and condescending at times its an okay show just not that great
2,the otter is very soft and well processed the inside is removable so that the cuddly toy can be washed operation is simple and easy to use nevertheless this sleep aid is only partially suitable for babies the engine that lifts our stomach is unfortunately so loud that it completely overcomes the soothing sounds when they are set to a quiet volume if the sounds are at maximum volume you still hear the engine this is quite annoying since we cant use this product to fall asleep with all the functions only lift and lower the belly we decided to return the product
2,love the top but very small to the size ordered a medium and had to send back in exchange for xlarge
2,the minute i put this sweater on i couldnt wait to take it off it was way too scratchy for me so for those with any type of sensitivity to wool this is not the sweater for you otherwise i thought the design was quite cute
2,the logo is in the middle for this laptop for me iam confused after seeing other review
2,i have always used cif and thought it a great product however now the micro granules in it are no long plastic you have to be careful where you use it as it does cause fine scratches be wary of using on stainless steel
2,i finally found this dress in store today and wow i cannot believe this cheap looking dress is from ms they have been among the top at retailer and this unlined baggy cheap velvet sub is a shock what happened only the color is nice please get back to yourself ms
2,these were great pants that fit well had good rise perfect stretch for my curves and i was really happy to get them on sale im lbs with a pear shape after only three months of occasional wear about once a week at most and following wash instructions perfectly they started deteriorating the pockets are becoming unsewn the fabric has overstretched in little sections that bunch and the bottom hem is coming unraveled these are the most lowquality horrible pants ive
2,this shirt was on sale and it was a good price that is where the goods ended the shirt was not flattering i sent it back asap
2,for hard water areas which is most of england you need to use two capsules in a wash giving only washes in this packet not the advertised
2,beautifully made shirt however the sizing is way off the sleeves and across the chest are really tight while the rest of the shirt fits fine if you get a size larger then the shirt in the body is to large would recommend if you have really tiny shoulders arms and chest such a shame since i really love the shirt
2,not for photography purpose photos looks too much bright on display not recommended for content creation and where true tone colors are important
2,quality jumpsuit but poor design the green made me look a bit like gumby the cartoon character
2,star wars has always been hit or miss regardless of what people say about the movies that came out when they grew up the originals they were great because they were fun andor its great because its dramatic star wars andor is a show that explores the dark themes of revolution that luke or the jedi never were exposed to and that weve never seen on screen the characters are some of the most complex of characters ive ever seen in star wars from the unspeakably excellent writing i e the character luthens speech in season one which anyone who knows it will tell you the same its a marvel of story telling to the cinematography i e the parallels to the french revolution in season two as the rebels work under the shroud of darkness risking their lives for their cause the beating heart of andor lies in the emotion you feel by sympathizing with the characters like cassian bix luthen clea mon and even the opposing empire characters like dedra and syril culminating in a story where everyone is on edge including you andor is not like the other star wars media its bitter and brooding just like the revolution
2,there is problem of battery backup hrs hardly goes if you full charge your laptop rest function are good
2,thad castle finally got his big break always thought he was a good actor finally got a big lead role he deserves it cant wait for big lead in a movie
2,i have purchased it on jan and now today it is september im not satisfied with battery because whenever i fully charged the laptop and if i not use it for day automatically charged dropped to zero again i need to charge it and another case is when i fully charged the laptop and if i open one browser in chrome and close the laptop without shutdown for hours then charge dropped to zero again i need to charge it remaining everything is good with that amount of money
2,im petite but even if i werent i think this runs very large isnt form flattering at all and overall looks dull it most definitely does not justify the price material is thin
2,within washings the color faded to a not so black black like a pair of pants that has been washed over a years use after or so washes the hook and eye closure began to fall off the pants fit well albeit a bit short im and they run small i sized up to a when i usually am between a or i let the hem out sewed the hook and eye closure back on and redyed them and now they are good to go but for nearly i dont expect to have to do this much work these are not my first
2,i have had this shirt for a little over a month ive wore it maybe times and there is a small hole in the middle of the sleeve on my shoulder its not even on a seam so i cant fix it i expect much better quality from retailer dont buy this the quality is very disappointing which is really unfortunate because this is a very nice fitting shirt and goes well with pencil skirts
2,dont buy this laptop audio quality display qualityvery poor and not worth full for this price
2,i loved this skirt so flattering and such a beautiful fabric unfortunately after only wears the waistband stretched out so much that it was falling off me literally i bought the right size and it was not too tight the waist band material simply lost its stretch very quickly very disappointing
2,i am a pretty curvy girl and thought the ml was gigantic i returned and was afraid to exchange for the smaller size thinking it would pbly be very large as well it was not flattering because it was so boxy
2,not worth at all laptop is slow even asphalt sometimes runs slow and if you open multiple tabs in browser laptop becomes slow
2,really like this dress but the dress is lined in a heavy fabric and weighs a lot for a summer dress worst of all there is no chance at all of getting the buttons through the button holes impossible has to go back
2,i wanted a comfortable and loose casual dress i liked the pictures and decided to give it a try the dress turned out to be too loose i got size after checking the measurements chart im lb and usually wear s i could practically wrap myself in this dress besides it looks a bit too long well im not as tall as the model in the photos and i dont like wearing high heels the material looks faded not as bright as in the pictures i like distressed and vintage style but this
2,i am now awaiting a replacement from sandisk because it failed after the amazon return period always had good luck with sandisk cards until now phone and pc simply stopped seeing the card lost all of my data which i fortunately had backed up elsewhere
2,regretfully this dress is on its way back for an exchange the dresss is beautiful and fits true to size i ordered it in both colors however the black has a defect in the lace right on the front of the dress and the white was tearing in a few spots under the arms and on the bottom again the dress is so pretty and i am hoping retailer will find me one without bunching pulls or tears for an exchange but i cant pay for a dress that is already torn
2,battery back up is very low
2,i suggest this tv series to everyone coz i learned too much from it and it is the best tv series ive seen
2,not good quality of display
2,i cant stand buying pants and i can see the pockets lining and my darker skin through the fabric i dont consider that highquality
2,this is reached this can be like series hes born for it i loved it prime make series hes physically so much better than cruise his accent demeaner and the way he talks is like james bond met jason bourne met the hulk hes the modern day hero a better actor than the rock
2,this dress is great if youre very skinny and have no chest otherwise it makes you look dowdy the colors are also quite washed out and do nothing for my complexion this one is going back
2,the title says it all only episodes in and ready to opt out even with everything going on it feels like theres nothing to it i know a lot of the cast and that drove me to it but they all seem wasted others lesser known are just bad actors
2,i am a very seasoned cook make everything from scratch made just as written cake sunk in middle and icing is like soup
2,was excited to try this interesting skirt as a mega bailey fan however this skirt didnt fit well the waist was fine but it then was boxy and shapeless on me in an xssize my piece also had a wrinkle from folding and im not sure how it would easily come out but the main thing is that the lines werent flattering to the body the vegan quilting isnt luxurious i thought the diagonal zipper style was cool but it doesnt lay to advantage when worn and im an easy fit length is soso
2,if you are thinking about purchasing this dress without trying on in person i bet you arent going to be happy with it for a phisique that is and lbs this dress is not too short however the back key hole design is just not flattering i felt like clothes in the back shoulder area is not fitted well and the zip up closure is not all the way zipped up even though it was so
2,display quality is average all is ok
2,this ran a bit small im normally a this was a and just fit the pattern was very digi the length was shorter than i hoped im and the fabric while structured was just cheap and acrylicfeeling pass
2,i loaded this memory card into my tft and could not get it to install i found it to be a format issue and could not reformat it to get it to work i sent it back and got the class sandisc card non ultra and it loaded perfactly
2,i absolutely love this show there isnt anything that compares to it
2,this dress was so pretty on the hanger but a saggy sack on even the sz was too loose and shapeless there is no waist as pictured the hilow hem loose fit and wavy waist seam see in the third closeup picture make it look like the dress shrunk oddly in the wash its really too bad its such a pretty combination of patterns
2,i used this for a few months in my phone then it decided to quit mounting i lost some pictures of pets who died shortly after i got a replacement card but i had to send in the old one giving up any chance of recovering its contents the new ones worked fine but failing after months in inexcusable
2,very cute dress but fabric is very flimsy and seams were very puckered which couldnt be pressed out
2,i was so excited to receive this top the material and design is gorgeous but it is way way way too short im with an hourglass shapeaverage build and it barely hit the top of my pants it otherwise fit true to size so disappointed and for the price it really should be cut better
2,going in i had reserved expectations usually shows of the bingable type are overrated i was pleasantly surprised at just how enjoyable this show was and how well casted its characters are jenna ortega is the perfect wednesday playing her with a refreshingly morbid sense of humor and dark yet wry outlook this is where the series sold me its increasingly rare to have a show where the protagonist is smart capable and endearing instead of onenote whiny or just simply unlikable i correctly guessed the overarching mysteries and plot twists fairly easily and early on but i didnt mind because i enjoyed the journey through the series and through wednesdays character growth another rare quality in modern tv protagonists cough cough shehulk cough cough the production as a whole is quite well done as is to be expected from cinematic mainstays like tim burton of course there are some cons it has the usual hollywood political overtones but it doesnt constantly beat you over the head with them some might say that a few characters are somewhat cartoonish or exaggerated but i take that to be in the spirit and style of the show as a whole and overall quite fitting i mean its the addams family not twin peaks the supporting cast including gwendoline christie luis guzman catherine zeta jones and other newer talents nicely round out the supporting characters the entire addams family was perfectly cast and thing is still one of my favorite characters in the show for those worried about waiting for a second season to conclude the story arc fear not this season is fairly well contained coming to a satisfying conclusion in the finale overall i was pleasantly surprised
2,keybord not working continue
2,useless productdonot buy its a honest suggestion also exchange value is also very less
2,ac power adapter error not charge issue
2,i thought the italian dressing totally overpowered the casserole i already have wonderful enchilada casserole recipes three of which i got from this websiteso i will be sticking with those it would probably be ok without the italian dressing but i wont be trying it again
2,but it runs super small i wear a medium for everything but couldnt come close to buttoning this the buttons were about inches apart horizontally probably should have ordered an extra large in order to fit the quality and styling seemed great but ordering online requires truth in sizing
2,i wanted to like this show give how many people praise it but having seen series as good as breaking bad chernobyl first half of game of thrones better call saul sopranos and others this show is not among those actually good shows but it is as good as lets say westworld though for entirely different reasons characters are solid the acting is mostly good i specially like hardy but some characters like polly are very inconsistent and becomes pretty annoying for no good reason other than to keep conflict going in the family everything is a little too dreamy plotwise and puts me off with a slight cringe from time to time its a bit hard to care about the characters when they dont have enough depth i think it just needs better planning to be what it wants to be though overall it is good enough i can appreciate the level of production it has and is undoubtly better than many other shows out there just not quite among the best i am very surprised it has an average at this point its more like an
2,an enthralling series that captivates the audience from its very opening scene to its final moments the debut season delivers an intensity that is both captivating and masterfully executed presenting characters who are intricately defined and rich with depth however regrettably the second season falters in its narrative approach particularly for those like myself who possess an intimate familiarity with italy its reminiscent of the misstep that woody allen encountered with to rome with love an outcome born from tired and overstated clichés about italian culture these portrayals likely stem from thirdgeneration italians residing in the us influenced by stories passed down from their parents or grandparents thus in an era increasingly marked by revisionism aiming to eradicate outdated racial representations in older films and even replacing the roles of the seven dwarfs in snow whites tale perhaps its now imperative to undertake a concerted effort to genuinely comprehend modern italians forsaking the antiquated stereotypes consider the reference to romes fiumicino airport and lost baggagean outdated notion as it has held its position as one of the most distinguished and wellequipped terminals for years with dozens of five stars international awards for excellence likewise the trite depictions of the mafia harken back to the s while the mafia endures it has shifted its operations towards the political and contractual sphere similarly the frequent emotional transitions of sabrina impacciatore undeniably adept at capturing even the minutest facial expressions are undercut by her abrupt mood swings and nearly childlike insecuritiesqualities that seem incongruous for the manager of a threestar inn let alone a luxury hotel these unpredictable and inconsistent emotional shifts also plague other italian characters showcasing commendable acting but hindered by lackluster writing moreover there are glaring missteps such as the final scene in which the container holding tanyas remains is positioned with a grace that suggests it is as light as a feather or the more overt depiction of quentin serenely smoking in the opulent hall with a conspicuously placed cigarette pack clearly marlboro a product placement perhaps changing its flap orientation five or six times within mere minutes nevertheless these may be trivialities however in my experience not all minor errors are created equalsome stand out glaringly due to their inconsistency a production of merit should meticulously attend to every detail in summation i can only surmise that an american viewer when observing this second season might not wince as an italian audience would given that these stereotypes likely circulate in the united states nevertheless i remain intrigued to discern the opinion of a hawaiian reviewer concerning the first season
2,so im not sure if its just my body type or what but this did nothing for me the bottom which i thought would be too big was actually too small in both the small and the medium im a size bottom and then when i sized up to the medium it was still too tight and then the top was loose i just think this one is going to take the right body type it could look really beautiful on the right person just not me
2,very disappointed in this top i have a short waist and it was still too short for me
2,ive read books im a fan of video games especially the rd part so after bingewatching the entire season im really sad to admit that the witcher tv series is a major disappointment the root cause of most problems with the series is without a doubt bad writing it is because of poor writing that fantasy series with a great storyline huge fanbase and developed universe still feels like a b grade tv production no matter how much money netflix has poured into the witcher series the lack of character building the plotjumping the laughably unrealistic dialogues all of it makes it nearly impossible to enjoy the show
2,description is wrong not a swing tunic more long and straight keep that in mind when buying this if you have hips this might not be the top for you
2,i typically wear a size xl in anything from retailer and i ordered this top in an xl its more of a tshirt with buttons than a blouse and it was overall too huge its nice to have extended size options but even if i went down to a size l this would have looked like a maternity top on me
2,i wear med or large in most items the medium was huge fit like a moo moo size down by at least two
2,i dont get the hype both seasons are about vapid americans staying in luxury hotels theres no humor no real satire its just uninteresting boring and pointless the actors try to be entertaining but the characters are empty unfortunately jennifer coolidge is not very good or believable the first season is rather homophobic with the constant clichés the second season is even less interesting i sat watching the white lotus thinking how boring can you get on the other hand the hotels are in lovely places and pretty to look at but id rather waste my time looking at pictures of hotels on a travel site rather than spend time on the white lotus seasons and
2,battery is way too bad
2,this dress is very cute and well made unfortunately it was too short waisted for me and runs small in the bust the arm holes were too big yet the bust small very weird fit on me i am six feet tall with c bust maybe if you are shorter with smaller chest this dress will work for you it has a thin lining and is not see through even though it is white fabric i love the dress it just wasnt made for my tall figure
2,fits large wrinkles easily and not what i expected for the price
2,this would have been cute if it was more fitted i am and lbs and the small was too wide i didnt try the xs because the small was almost too short in the sleeves and so was the length
2,working very slow
2,season was really really good season was not barely worth watching not even a shadow by episode of season it was barely watchable having watched reacher season it pales in comparison to its first season season was pretty captivating with a very interesting storyline that was both intriguing and complex in contrast season is a big letdown the characters once full of depth and development now seem flat and unevolving the storyline which previously kept me on the edge of my seat now feels empty and uninspired its a stark contrast to the excellence of the first season which skillfully blended action with characterdriven storytelling
2,by itself after this so heavily hyped girls women and seahorses nonsense a young sinister lady shows how emanzipation gets done right way kick umbrella and their attempt to brain wash in bin all efforts to have super hero girls being so important and unique with a much lesser budget this show here nails it wednesday has no need to please mainstream she does not even think about it as character she plays all other addams family to wall jenna ortega must be born wednesday or at least sharing soul her acting catches from first till last moment if some need a female idol within super heroes to me wednesday is one regardless if boomer millenials or kleber generation
2,these run at least sizes smaller than other styles of the same brand mother such a bummer because the quality is totally on point im going to exchange them for a huge size i guess whatever i dont mind having a size thats so much larger than all my other jeans i just mind the complete hassle of the exchange process i wish mother would get their sizing issues under control its not retailers fault so annoyed
2,i ordered this dress in my usual sz it seemed to be tight on the hips then i tried the next sz and it was tight because i realized that the lining was very sticky and would bunch up underneath making the dress look defective on me not for curvy on bottom i think if you are more slim down below this will maybe work but i had to return for this reason i was considering cutting out the lining because it was so cute and i really liked the look of the dress if it goes on sale i may purch
2,i am a fan of the jack reacher books and was deeply disappointed in the two movies with tom cruise i was very excited when i heard they were making a series starring alan ritchson this is the adaptation that reacher fans have been waiting for the inclusion of the flashbacks of his military upbringing really fleshed out the character the fight scenes were excellent the musical score was superb
2,osm laptop but to install the apps need to reboot systeam and need to allow so many steps not gets good opinion on it and also when use putting charger its hanging so wiared also good looking laptop but expectation not upto the mark
2,lower scored reviews are accurate this tries above average to be something but not only does it not know what it is but has no idea how to get there it tries to have an air of mystery but instead feels like a sad sitcom that isnt really funny but depressing the actors were good with what they had but they can only do so much it barely gave you sentences at the beginning to keep the mystery that is the point of this show in existence i would rather avoid this resort at all costs i thought this was a new apple show see also the awfulness that is misquito coast in that its confusing plot and slow pacing with nothing to look forward to led me to wonder what the hell the point to all of it was the writer forgot to add something to make you want to watch it further
2,the battery drains too much even with normal usage fan noise also irritates more please dont buy this model
2,both seasons play out similarly quirky cast and story that builds intrigue brilliantly as story lines intertwine sadly when you reach the crescendo in the final episodes it is not as clever as you would hope each episode adds another perspective and builds an intriguing picture of where the story is headed sadly its not really leading anywhere necessarily it sets up as if it is going to be phenomenally clever and then its pretty uninspiring characters are colourful and the ost is catchy season is slightly stronger and wouldve warranted a higher score on its own characters in season two are less well established and do chafe a bit both build well both end ok
2,i ordered this vest in xxs since i am usually an xs and was looking for a bit of a tighter fit on such a loose vest even then the vest looked like a large not only was it incredibly loose much looser than in looks in the picture but the arm holes were huge too it just looked too big not artfully drapey
2,really wanted to lovebutthe way it fitlower part a tad too flowyalmost maternity like to hide a belly and the top area feels like my chest is being smushed despite my bra size being a modest bthe look it gave was square on top almost block like with bottom that had flaresuch a pretty top unfortunately the overall design just didnt work me
2,i purchased this in the yellow xs it is very comfortable but extremely seethrough youd have to wear a slip or something underneath it but im not sure what would work based on the style and even if i wore a strapless bra it was still seethrough unfortunately i had to return it
2,i tried this on in my regular size and was able to get it on fine but the cup portion of the suit was just crazy with the straps tied tightly around my neck it was like the cups just flipped out and open i am a regular b cup and i dont think it was sizing though i did not have the opportunity to try multiple sizes the cup did not right and for this reason would make this absolutely impossible to wear unfortunate because the design is so pretty
2,i too will be returning this sweater love the style shape and fabric but after one wearing it has pilled terribly and now looks old and cheap
2,i was forced to watch all seasons recently and season was by far the best as it had some suspense and thought provoking scenes but when looking at the entire showits literally about nothing most of the scenes are not linked or have any meaning people going about their lives imagine watching a movie and the actor goes into a store thats it youre left sitting there askingok why as a viewer or audience ironically its the very definition of time wasting as we sit in front of a tv all seasons seem to share the idea of having at least characters being able to trigger the audience in some obnoxious way make everyone a potential candidate for death have some sort of self redeeming or realization moment then ultimately some lack luster death the white lotus cookie cutter recipe would not recommend watching there are better shows with substance
2,im at pear shape the pockets really opened up when i put them on and didnt lay flat loose on leg opening which i liked but the pockets sticking out around the hip area made my pear shape even wider i got a medium
2,not for codingi thought it would be good if this laptop is expensive but it is nothing like that its performance is very bad battery backup is very poor i never expected it to be like this totally disaster
2,the pants are pretty and run true to size but the fabric is bathing suit like very thin and sheers in the butt when you squat i wouldnt recommend for anything but waking
2,i ordered a size small usually i am ps but wanted the extra length usually i can get away with a regular small but not this time such a cute style but made me look short wide unfortunately its going back
2,this dress looked gorgeous light and lacy in the picture but when it arrived the lace that appeared gold and black in the photo was more a solid brown pattern against the black which was not attractive the inner sheath was made of a heavy sequined material it was uncomfortable scratchy and felt like i was searing chain mail it also added bulk to the dress so that i looked ten pounds heavier i cant imagine why they would design this delicate dress with such a heavy inner slip the si
2,i love almost all tops from retailer however this one was just enormous it is beautifully designed but it was so huge when i tried it on that i couldnt believe it was sized i even checked the tag to see if maybe they placed a size tag on an xl shirt for reference i am and lbs i would have loved this shirt if it hadnt been so big
2,works very well but buying november does not work anymore it is expensive for only month of use really disappointed
2,how does this series rate so well with people absolute garbage only rich affected white people eating and drinking no plot terrible acting i watched both seasons it should have been cancelled after the first pilot nothing but sex drugs and rock n roll the only requirement to making a movie or series i am particularly offended by the series exploiting the local people outside the four seasons hotels the series pretends to feel sorry for the locals while cluelessly making look naive and ignorant the four seasons organization should be ashamed im sure the hotel chain funded the filming to plug their resorts
2,i really like both colors in this top i love the way it lays the length the material etc what i dont like is that the arm holes are very large and shows the entire side of your bra this is definitely a summer top so why would someone want to have to wear a cami when its warm enough to go sleeveless too bad i would have bought it for sure
2,i recommend this product but with the following reservations the dye from the product colors my skin every time i wear this outfit i love the fit and make of the jumper but i hate that my skin looks blue by the end of the day this is still happening after several washes which makes me feel disappointed it will dye your undergarments so choose wisely
2,i liked this top okay but i did not think it was worth full price i thought it was only average
2,i bought the shirt in ivory and went down a size per the advice from other reviewers what i should have done was go down sizes runs huge my husband said i looked pregnant and thats never a good look if your not sent this back the same day
2,i was so smitten by this shirt when i saw it online i love embroidery and purple is my favorite color i am a size and decided to order an l the shoulders fit well but the rest of it was hugelike another reviewer saidlike a maternity top i would also concur with the reviewer who said what takes away from the lovely purple flowers is the blotchy moss dye finish on the fabric this is so true the embroidery does not stand out is not highlighted like in the photograph they hav
2,i never review anything i watch but after completing the last episode and i genuinely created this account specifically for the purpose of writing this review because i dont know if i have ever been as angry as i am now at a show if you have ever waited on hold for tech support for three hours only to have the person tell you to unplug it then plug it back in again then have your call drop you may have already experienced something similar to watching this show i gave this two stars instead of one because the acting is actually really good with the exception of alexandria daddario i do not exaggerate at all when i say hers was likely the worst acting i have ever seen in anything of her scenes feature her at atleast one point but usually severalmany points slack jawed blank staring and forcing words out as if she is a toddler learning to speak for the first time and i know i know her whole thing is that she is in a life crisis and she is supposed to look confused and lost but this is so so ridiculously cartoony and over done i hate how this sounds as i type it but genuinely if i did not know better i would think she was playing mentally impaired the writing throughout the show keeps you watching because the show starts with the finale scene which leads you to believe the ending will definitely be a twist then the show is so anticlimactic you feel each episode you are getting closer to the twist ending suspenseful music even plays throughout the entire thing leading you to believe this is alll just build up for the last episode because of course nothing could be this meaningless then sure as sh there it is the most pointless most meaningless ending you will ever see in anything surely this is the point and yes i do get that is the artistic appeal blah blah blah im sure someone would argue i just dont understand art i do i do i just absolutely can not stand stuff like this if i watched it and was fully prepared to be disappointed by the ending i might have enjoyed it more so for any readers out there trying to decide if youre going to watch this or not i say do it but prepare for a let down
2,performance wise is not good and the battery is also not good the charging time battery and adapter is too hot totally a waste of money dont trust the lenovo
2,i tried giving this show a try i gave it episodes and it was just sooooooooo boring i usually give shows a episode shot maybe if i can but if im not hooked i cant watch anymore because of all the hype on social media about this show i stuck it out for episodes and i just dont get it whats so good about it what am i missing i just find it so dull and boring i usually love jennifer coolidge but in this show shes just like other characters shes played dialled up to trying too hard and really i could have done without steve zahns penis like gross i did not need to see that
2,one of the best series ive ever watched baby yoda probably the cutest thing ive ever seen great action and great work by everyone this is how star wars should be
2,i wanted to love this sweater but the fit is just awkward it is very short and box and ends up being very short in the back i am going to return this item
2,i loved this shirt when it first arrived and i couldnt wait to wear it after one day of wear i went to hang the shirt back up and it was ripping on both sides of the middle back seem this shirt was not tight on me at all very disappointed
2,if you look at the th photo of the grey shirt and zoom in you can get an accurate view of the back this shirt is attached in not one but two places in the back in the photos of the black shirt it looks like it is only attached or knotted in one place and that is not the case disappointing unless you want to wear this as an offtheshoulder shirt with a strapless bra size down caveat sizing down will become problematic though for those with large arms as the sle
2,heating issue
2,this top is a good concept but the structure of it is not for all body types i am and and wear an xs to a s in retailer tops and i ordered this is a small and it was huge in the chest and tight at my hipswill be returning
2,gb card works fine in the device but this gb card will unmount when moving or copying large amounts of datanever tried reformatting or indepth troubleshooting but i expect products from a reputable company like sandisk to just work
2,the flavor was good but i did find it a little too moist and left me feeling like it was too oily
2,these are my all time comfiest shorts and i am obsessed with the lavender color sadly using free and clear detergent on a cold delicate cycle made the color turn splotchy and they are unwearable this happened once and i exchanged for another pair but ill be returning this pair ill be sad to see my favorite color go but there is obviously a defect in the dye used maybe ill try another color
2,hi when i received this top i tried it on looked in the mirror and packed it up for a return the quality is excellent but it just too boxy fits nothing like it appears on the model
2,theres a glaring lack of vision into what security would likely be like in the future in this series the surveillance and attempted seizure of andor by the imperial authorities as depicted is antiquated and doesnt even compare with surveillance and seizure capabilities of contemporary society in china and even in usa china has known pervasive surveillance and fbi has demonstrated alarmingly efficient abilities to identify and arrest hundreds of likely well armed individuals recently and so i ask where are the surveillance cameras where is the surveillance of communications and social media and for that matter the imperial authorities would have no compunction to insert homing devices on everyone those lacking it would be immediately be arrested as suspects then we havent mentioned the block captains lackeys of the regime that communist regimes have employed for decades once again imperial authorities are sketched as bumbling fools
2,reviewing after watching episode i dont get it i simply dont get how a prestigious show with incredible writing and acting like this was produced by disney i consider myself a big star wars fan ive eaten all the slop thats been spat out since disney bought the rights but my god ive grown tired of it the prequels had a good vision but fell flat on their feet the original trilogy are great cinema classics and the sequels had good moment for every bad moments ive watched it all and as a star wars consumer for me most star wars content ranges from okay i guess to just good with a lot of not so good sprinkled throughout i thought rogue one fit into the just good category it did nothing wrong i liked its tone but the movie really didnt feel like much until its third act the mandalorian is okayjust good its fun at times but bogged down with cameos and baby yoda so when you look at disney star wars track record and say heres a whole show about the secondary protagonist from that one just good movie you cant go into it expecting much but here we are disney seemingly put all their focus and effort into producing kenobi only to give us one of the most disappointing pieces of media of the s and left the andor team to their own devices probably thinking no one will care about andor as much as kenobi well that team makes you care im going to assume unlike every other star wars production thus far disney meddling was little to none there is no hey remember this or no this is a cute creature meant to sell hundred dollar toys no instead tony gilroy has brought to the table one of the finest television productions of the century thus far everything is crafted with such immaculate purpose in the show every shot musical composition line of dialogue it all matters nothing is wasted everything has purpose and it is all so incredible to watch unfold i get the same feeling in this that i get from watching say breaking bad what a bold comparison im aware where youre constantly wondering what happens next where the story and characters are gonna go and when you get to it you go wow the payoff was absolutely worth it it all feels so lovingly created and performed nothing about this show screams star wars yet its the best star wars has ever been every character thus far old or new is interesting every actor is bringing their a game and beyond i mean andy serkis performance in just three episodes really i watched that in a star wars production it just doesnt seem like reality its visually gorgeous the compositions are well done the lighting is great and fits the mood when it needs to the costumes are great the props are great its all great i cant say it enough andor should not be good by all accounts this should have been disneys biggest miss yet yet its their only hit and its a bullseye ive never written a review before ive seen amazing shows and movies but everyone knows theyre amazing what can i say about goodfellas that hasnt been said before so ive never felt compelled to review it despite how much i adore it but andor i just needed to review it i needed to review it because i shouldnt have had to because i expected not to this review is messy and all over the place but if youre here you need to take one thing away watch this show if you havent
2,i finally ordered a pair of these jeans after seeing so many rave reviews and when they went on sale im leaving this review for women who share my body type im slim with longer legs and dont really have curves i typically dont purchase jeans with an inseam shorter than for reference i really love the fit of paige and mih jeans these jeans have an inseam of which i thought would be fine but for me the cut wasnt flattering at all i typically look for jeans that
2,i was attracted to the feminine design of the dress the silhouette the flouncy skirt however i ordered the red motif pattern and hated the splotchy dark colors
2,i am and the arms of this sweater run at least inches past my finger tips if the arms were not quite so rediculously long then i would definitely keep it but unless you are tall it just doesnt work also i felt the length of the waste was a little shorter than what is pictured online sigh
2,the quality is good as is the design idea but practically it doesnt work ordered an xs and the top still ballooned out stiffly this top is not soft or flowy it is stiff and very wide
2,i had high hopes for this tunic for an upcoming ny trip to look stylish and beat the heat it is huge the tunic swallowed my whole it came down nearly to my knees im and it was gigantic shapeless and did not look stylish at all on the model it looks like it hits midthigh i am a size and the l was like a giant trash bag on me if i had time i would try the medium
2,the storage works for my phone but when you install the storage into the sd adapter my computer doesnt read the data
2,i was very excited about this product when i saw it the pattern was beautiful in the romantic floral and the bottom band looked like the bathing suit was a little longer so i felt it would be good for a large chest when i received the package i knew instantly it ran small i tried it on and it barely covered half of my chest also the band at the bottom is actually very small and not what i expected the print is just as lovely in person as it is online i dont even know if sizing up will mak
2,this dress would have been gorgeous and consistent with retailers aesthetic if the designs had been embroidered onto a thick silkjacquard fabric to give it texture which is how it looks from the photo obviously it would have been more expensive but in any case this was just a really expensive polyester dress which it says in the product description but i gave retailer the benefit of the doubt thinking if anyone can make even polyester look like a quality product itll be retailer but now i
2,sound is very low display is not so bright as nits
2,i was glad to see that this show managed to overcome my skepticism with tim burton this seemed like it should have been a perfect match of artist and muse but the trailers had me concerned i still find the casting of the majority of the addams family as the biggest disservice to the series but they play such brief supporting roles that it allowed jenna ortega to be the primary focus and do an excellent portrayal of an older wednesday addams thanks to the amount of screen time she was allotted there was ample time to overcome the odd casting choices of the rest of the family the writing was also exactly what i expected for the character cold and sharply cutting quickwitted rebuttals that ortega delivers with the emotional vacancy needed to fit the role the overarching story is a simple who dun it plot that limited the chances of being exposed to plot holes while serving as a vehicle to explore the expanded setting with all new characters are pretty much high school tropes even falling into nicknamed cliques and social circles based on what kind of spooky monsters they are but thankfully burton dialed back the teen drama that tends to ruin shows like cobra kai i still cant get over the fact that gomez looks like a meth dealer and morticia went from being agelessly regal to looking old and tired overall it still succeeds in being entertaining and accomplishing what it wanted to with enough plots lingering in the background for more seasons each episode had a lot going for it making them feel longer than they were
2,i tried this on in a medium in the store and it was too big overall i thought it was a nice concept for a feminine whimsical top so i ordered a small online but even then a small is still too big and i usually wear a medium or an in tops maybe if it was slimmer through the ribswaist area it could work but it just ends up looking maternityish and too voluminous everywhere below the bust the front was too short as well stopped higher than what is shown on the model and im assuming sh
2,just found this show and binged watched seasons in a week really good actors on this series but kevin costner and cole hauser steal the show with their performances the filming is done well to give you a sense of how sparsely populated and vast the ranch is it gives you a sense of what a world without feels like in the current time where death can come for you easily whether by coincidence or at the hands of another a place where its still the wild west first two seasons are a bit slow paced and takes its time to develop character backstories but man is it worth it come season season should be wild right from the start taylor sheridan is a master storyteller and everything with his name on it turn to gold wind river no country for old men hell or high water if youre looking for a new show to watch this wont disappoint
2,i really like the look of the top when it is photographed on other people but it just isnt for me the fabric is stiffer than i would have expected and not very moveable the fit is not quite right on me the longer sleeves detract from the look of the shirt i also generally prefer things a little more form fitting of which this is not it was not very comfortable for me either so this was clearly not a win for me
2,the horseradish was not a great compliment to these sandwiches at all all the star ratings fooled me the horseradish taste like how it sound it has a very strong taste and is spicy i would make this again with all the other ingredients i highly recommend finding an alternative to the horseradish
2,three strikes and retailer is out for me i am so disappointed i really liked this dress and was looking for a fun distinctive new shift dress got it tried it on took it off went back to look at the listing onlinenowhere does it mention that it has a dropseam in the shoulders i guess you can see it if you zoom in closely on the image but its not mentioned in the text who on gods green earth actually looks good with a dropshoulder it hits every woman under right in the middl
2,i loved this tunic the first time i wore it i ordered it in the red and it was very flattering on my postpregnancy figure and extremely cute with leggings and boots just what i wanted it fit true to size even with a few extra pounds around the chest area imagine my horror when i pulled it out of the wash having followed the directions on the tag exactly and discovered it had shrunk and no longer fit properly in particular the sleeves became incredibly uncomfortably tight and much sh
2,i loved the idea of this dress and was hoping it would be worth the astronomical price tag for what really is a cotton jersey dress unfortunately this dress missed the mark in the pictures this dress looks like the fabrics are navy blue and some sort of white well it is not white or whitish at all but baby pink bright baby pink even the light pattern on the navy background is actually pink huge disappointment my other issue is with the length of this dress the description says that the
2,the fabric is great the design is fun i thought the dress would be perfect for work and also wear for a fun night out the fit was perfect up top but the bottom part was to full and a lot longer then i expected so i had to return it
2,no free ms office included
2,im using this card on my galaxy note but its slow and phone constantly unable to read the card
2,this recipe was very easy and looks good i only changed one thing and that was just using half the salt which happens to be way too much also you should add salt last the cheese can have lots of salt and the butter too it is ruined and will go in the trash and i hate wasting food sad sad
2,screen freeze on first day and trackpad not working
2,i loved the aesthetic but as a true hourglass shape i was frustrated that it didnt have a little more give as i tried to pull it over my head the fabric was stiff and seemed to be lace over cotton not entirely sure i couldnt get past the feeling off the material
2,i was so excited that retailer finally had some bermuda shorts for those of us that are older and dont want to show off that much leg anymore and are curvy on the bottom and really cannot wear the shorter shorts i ordered these immediately in the navy i usually wear a in pilcro jeans and like the other reviewer observed as well i was floating in these not only in the waist but everywhere the legs are big but its supposed to be a boyfriend cut so i get that but they just are
2,the engine is too loud and unfortunately too big for the whole
2,before making these recipes i always read the reviews since this had good ones and i love cherry desserts i made them they seemed baked through and browning on the top but as they sat they just kept getting softer and softer they taste good but you have to use a spatula to serve them
2,its only been on for two episodes and i have no idea what this show is supposed to be about because its so damn boring im not even sure id care if i did know the only thing i know is that all of the characters are deplorable and i hope they all somehow get killed
2,worst display colours look so different not suitable for web developers designers and graphic designers not even suitable for watching movies or pictures
2,ive only watched season three but i dont have any desire to watch any others the reason is i have no desire to watch a show about characters i would cross the street to avoid i dont understand making unlikeable characters with few to no redeemable qualities the focus of the show the last episode of season three did it for me the situation was way too contrived for the climax and so clumsily done and character logic made no sense at times with a little finesse the climax couldve been a lot better the climax also showed the least offensive characters became the worst and what was that wrapup some storylines werent resolved and some characters walked away from carnage like it was nothing i dont know if this show was to illustrate that people are just scumbags because if it was mission accomplished hbo does need to something about its shows from the last few years way too many center on miserable and unlikeable characters character depth isnt measured by how much of dick a character can be
2,followed the recipe resulting dough was too slimy and runny added cup more flour to thicken the dough helped to shape them and get them on the baking sheet cooked for minutes on as directed when i took them out of the oven of them had burned on the bottom they also look nothing like the picture at least the part of the cookies that were not burned taste good i guess
2,i wanted to like this sporty dress too i teach at an elementary school and like to get down on my knees st my students level plus we can get messy most days with our learning and most days are go go go being on every secondthe armholes were cut too big and weirdly squared i didnt like the middle ridge either as it was unflattering it was returned
2,my husband did not like this and i would use corn tortillas instead of flour
2,i did not care about this show at all nothing about it interested me i did not find it funny and didnt think it was well written the only reason i was curious to know what happened was to understand how people were enjoying it so much knowing how it all turned out i still dont get it i think that people will sit through just about anything if it is on tv and looks nice
2,the peplum for this time hit me in the middle of my rib cage not at my natural waist so it looked very odd when it flared out with the peplum so high up i am busty so its possible this would not be the case for everyone but i generally can wear peplum tops with no problem i was disappointed to return it the fabric was very nice and the concept behind the shirt was a good one
2,first its huge im not big busted but its so roomy that i looked like i was pregnant not exactly what i was going for nice color and soft fabric but would only work if you plan to tuck it inand im short waisted so no tucking for me back it went
2,mine came smelling like gasoline not sure why but i would have kept it otherwise its a smell that will be really hard to get out looks like the picture
2,i ordered online i sized up one size it fit perfect so flattering and so pretty then i tried to take it off and the zipper stuckbadly minutes later i was sadly packing it up to ship back the zipper is that awful
2,i ordered the white and the light blue in size xl both are cut much smaller than is typical for my other retailer xl blouses everything the first reviewer wrote is true the photos of the white top show a detailed back when it is plain like the blue the back is just a solid kind of slippery material its strange because its not seethrough in the back but you need to wear a tankcami for the front so it makes the shirt that much tighter since you need to have the extra layer i would
2,so much extra fabric not something i would recommend buying online
2,beautiful fabric unfortunately i had to return it after just one wear it had pills all over the side fabric is too delicate sad to return
2,i bought this shirt after reading so many positive reviews it looks much thinner and cheaper than the photo depicts like many reviewers have said it does hit just above midriff but the fringe covers your belly it didnt hang right on me and i felt like i was wearing a rug
2,i was so disappointed with the quality of this dress especially because it looks so beautiful on the model the fabric was so thin that after one hand wash its already developing a tiny hole and pilling also it is definitely not a day dressi wore it as a swim coverup but it is much too thin and pajamalike to be worn as an actual dress the color is much different in personthe blue is brighter and for lack of a better way to describe it cheap looking the white banding around the t
2,this is a really cute dress just did not look flattering on me at all i suppose i could have gone down a size however i just did not love it i am athletic build dd i read the other reviews and everyone loves this dress here is what i did not like there are pockets which i cannot figure out the purpose that lay oddly all bunched up right at the hips due to the shape of the dress it bunches out on my short frame it made me look shorter and wider the fabric is a lightwei
2,but like other reviewers said it looks nothing like the picture of the model i am and lbs i usually wear an xs in maeve and i ordered the xs petite the straps are not adjustable so the top part of the dress is up too high and then there is just so much material it looks like im months pregnant and i usually love loose dresses like this but the way this falls really does make you look like you are hiding a sack of potatoes so bummed because the material is beautiful and i lo
2,got a defective memory card showed only gb instead of the gb returned it for a replacement and never got the replacement got my money back and went to walmart
2,functional carillon my month old girl falls asleep listening to the melodies that play sweetly for minutes i find it useless everything else breath and various sounds and i dont know if maybe the light can serve later the design is bad this animal nn is not at all nice to see for the little ones so much so that i had to make some changes put a pink dress add a bow in the head and create the eyes the controls are inside the puppet and therefore not practical if the baby sleeps awake with the noise of the tear that gives access to the various buttons for what it is it is really too expensive
2,no backlight keyboard no ms office activated very bad
2,i bought this online this looked like a sweater that was accidentally shrunk in the dryer when i received it i will be returning this
2,big pockets make it look more like a bathrobe than a coat there are no internal pockets and the loops for the belt are pretty skimpy just a bit of string the color is great but the quality leaves something to be desired
2,i got this top to wear with shorts as the color goes with a lot of different prints the quality is excellent this top runs very large as in three sizes too large for the record i am a and ordered my regular size the xs and this top makes me like im pregnant with twins also the layering looks nothing like it does on the model it looks sloppy unkept and a general i think this would still be great for ladies who are bigger in the chest and waist otherwise it just doesnt wor
2,i watched a few episodes in but i wasnt able to watch any further because i was at a relatives house but i enjoyed those episodes and wanted to watch more well when i finally got hulu in the handmaids tale was the first show i hopped on and i binged it through from season in a matter of two months and i loved every second of it id say that season is my least favorite and season is my favorite my only problem with this show is that yes june made some of the dumbest decisions that had me yelling at the screen but other than that i loved this show to pieces and i was so upset that it ended even though it was a satisfying ending i cannot wait for season and im impatiently waiting
2,unfortunately not so good for the priceone easily gets to the inside lying mechanics adjusts easilythere is still a lack of protection i would say also bad to close still capable of development too bad
2,will not be making this again coming from new england this is definitely not new england clam chowder
2,i used half the sugar so it wasnt overly sweet for me but its corn meal white flour ratio is off i think it tasted more like a yellow cake than corn bread to me not great as a corn bread
2,i used this laptop for one and a half year and right after the warrenty battery started swelling the battery is worth and u cant find it anywhere only u might get it in service center so i am using it without a battery now i am scared when power might come and blow my laptop away totally avoid this one unless u wanna take a risk of repairs every year
2,i bought this skirt in my usual xxs petite and the waist was way too small i could not even pull the skirt all the way up returned
2,the dress arrived with a few snags and the fabric already pilling the fabric will only get worse with wear return cute concept poor fabric quality
2,battery health is ok but charging not staying as per norm getting off hrs of use
2,this is not even a dolman style sweater because its loose fitting everywhere around the arm the point of a dolman sweater is that the sleeves are fitted around the wristforearm but this is not the case with this sweater its super loose around the wrist area i can fit both of my wrists into a sleeve
2,i just got this and couldnt wait to wear it to work today it is such a pretty designed top unfortunately it is falling apart as i write this review one sleeve is unraveling there are strings hanging off all over the lacy arms am so disappointed in the quality ill be sending it back when i get home
2,this shirt is beautiful it is flowy and light a perfect piece for transitioning from winter to spring however do not follow the washing instructions on the tag it says you can machine wash tumble dry low and despite going one step further and washing on my gentle cycle in cold water and drying it on extra low it came out of the wash so small that a child could barely wear it it went from being a tunic to an inappropriate crop top i will never wear again if you do order please take the
2,perhaps i should have gotten two sizes smaller but the knees on these were baggie by lunch they are very soft and comfortable but i wouldnt buy them again
2,i always make mine in a crockpot i thought last minute i wanted this and gave it a try sorry was not happy it looked odd to not have an egg to hold together but i gave it a shot
2,there is a fingerprint option while buying the laptop but after getting the laptop there is no fingerprint so dont buy this laptop
2,i usually love a cowl neck sweater but not this one you cant wear it off the shoulders and its weirdly sheer too the only pro is that it doesnt include wool or fur
2,unfortunately this sweater let me down i love retailer especially their sweaters but this one fell flat it was tight on the arms and didnt hang well on my body it was odd in length and added about lb to my frame i kept it because i wanted to force it to work alas i just donated it hopefully it fits someone else better than me
2,i love this brand i literally live in their tops this one is a bit of a disappointment it is made out of fabric that feels cheap reminding me of a tissue tee instead of the normal thicker quality of all their other products its very thin and see through unless wearing a camisoleslip underneath you have to have the perfect bra and pants situation going on underneath no muffin tops or back fati got the black and am keeping it only because i love the design need a black top desperat
2,i am usually a size o and ordered and xs due to the band in the center not much give it was a little difficult to shimmy over my hips but the body fit perfectly when i got passed that part that being said the cup design is a hot mess i am a bc cup size and the top on this could not handle it i felt fully exposed i thought maybe if i went a size up i could get a little more coverage the body felt ok on the small but the cups were still just too small i still felt to exposed they are
2,this cardigan is made of nice materials and is lined but it is boxy and totally unfitted i swim which means i have large shoulders and this thing makes me look like a boxing champion well a fat boxing champion as it has not wasteline the sleeves are too long and as usual retailer saves on money by using little cheap hooks instead of buttons as a closing system so if you choose to close this cardigan it just looks awful
2,bad product hanging problem
2,all i have to say is very powerful in many ways than one a bowto the mind of the writers with worries of your sanity lol great stuff all who created
2,this did not last very long would not work in any of my mobile devices i tried it in different ones and the only place it now works is in my desktop in the adapter sleeve not much use there since i already have tb
2,first the fabric is beautiful and lovely for spring and summer i really wanted to like this top but the fitting is so awkward for me i typically where a xs and sized up in the shirt to a size it was very tight and pulled funny across the chest size a i also found the cut at the shoulders very narrow need a strapless bra and made it look unflattering overall had to return this one back to the store
2,didnt like the service there was a scratch mark on the upper body i requested for the replacement but they took so much time and asked for the images repeatedly and didnt respond on time they just kept procrastinating
2,i wish i could deep fry my brain so that i can forget and watch this whole show again for the first time what a masterpiece wonderful characters premium story and cillian murphy putting on the greatest acting performance of his life as tommy shelby show matches the hype and this is easily one of the greatest shows ive ever watched i give this and its welldeserved i cannot wait to see how it all ends
2,the color of this dress is gorgeous and i really wanted to love it but it was awful i am and the length was fine the problem is the lack of shape which made me look lbs heavier than i am it would make a great maternity dress since that is what it already looks like
2,this is one of those you can tell from the hanger that its not going to work too boxy too short and the girlish ruffle makes it look like an oversized childs shirt that got all messed up in the washing machine
2,i wanted to love this coat so bad the material is lovely and its beautiful on the hanger but being tall and skinny is a must to pull it off if you have any hips forget it my hips are you end up looking incredibly bottom heavy the jacket also ran funny across the shoulderslike the underarm was sewn low down the arm so arm movement was restricted it was weird but it buttoned nicely without any pulling so it wasnt a size thing i bought a size medium at and pounds
2,very cute tweezers light and soft music negative points it is impossible to use also duvet because it is very heavy because of the box inside it is necessary to remove the scratch each time to adjust the teddy so it serves as decoration in the bed of my son
2,although the material of this top is beautiful and the quality is nice as well it really did not lay right on me im a d and i got my usual size in a small the arm holes were a bit too big the waist was too wide and it overall looked like a bib on me
2,well even if it was not the same as the addamss family of tim burton i think the wednesday of addams family movie was much dark and more dark fun even if gomez was close of the book i preferred raul julia rip and even with those remark its a really a very good show and i was impressed by the story and dark investigation that was remind me the tim burtons sleepy hollow intrigue and investigation wait for the saison and another investigation hope netflix will not kill it as they love to kill tv show because its cost so much special thumb up for jenny ortega for her role of wednesday and cameo of christina ricci as vilain
2,not extodenery product but valu for money
2,this dress looks so cute in the picturesi love the style ordered typical size and it was hugefelt like many sizes too big
2,the laptop is good in performance but the battery backup is not satisfactory it only discharge in hours
2,this product runs either really small or is super high waisted either way not for me
2,these pants looked worn washed old looking when i received them the quality is super thin cotton as if its been washed a million times is about to fall apart the workmanship is terrible you can see loose stitching all over the top portion is too tight looks terrible stretched out i liked absolutely nothing about this pants except the idea of them from the picture online
2,these are very flattering thick leggings that would keep you warm in the fall and winter but when i pulled them up i got a big hole in the seam at the waistband at my first trip to the bathroom obviously you might expect a rip if they were too tight but these fit perfectly even on the looser side and ripped effortlessly pretty embarrassing given the price bringing these back for reference if you decide to try your luck i am and my normal size s was perfect
2,i want to like this top because the idea is cute but i ordered the small and it might have well been xxxl with sizing like this one size fits all could just about do it
2,way too much fabric sticks out like jodhpurs but from the hip eek might be a great dress in rayon or a drapey fabric but the extra fabric just piles up on itself the outer layer also doesnt feel like it will breath add the cotton lining and i think it will feel miserable in the heat of the texas summer returning
2,this should have been cute but the fabric choice ruching design made me look like i had elephant skin rippling around my waist super unflattering
2,was very disappointed with this dress its very baggy no shape felt like an oversized sack purchased in med bust area was only semi good fit all else flopped
2,i bought this in size xl it is so much bigger than i expected there are panels of material it really is huge not flattering at all still i kept it the material is so soft flowy ive gotten good use wearing it around the house doing chores resting etc i wouldnt wear it out doing errands but around home its perfect for feeling cozy such a strange cut i dont know who would look good in it since it can look sloppy i think many would enjoy wearing it at home
2,these were perfect in the legs nice and stretchy but problematic in the waist im generally a size but i had to squeeze to get them to close theyve already gone back if you have a tinier waist theyd probably be fine
2,the cut of this dress is gorgeous and it could be great if it were made of quality silk and was lined although the color is beautiful the cheap fabric has no variation is too saturated and lacks any sheen of quality silk shocked at the price i still have beautiful silk dresses from retailer pre being back the quality
2,i was so so excited to get this sweater in the mail unfortunately the sweater is lined with the same material very soft and warm btw as the polka dots which sheds like crazy i wore a white tshirt under this for the first time and my shirt was covered in black fuzz by the end of the day so much so that i was gathering balls of it to be thrown away very disappointed a lint roller cant even clean up the tshirt in terms of sizing this fits tts i normally wear a l or xl got this in an
2,the bottom part of this romper is easy to put on but the top is very poorly designed it needs a zipper at the side or less of a yoke along the back you have to wrangle your limbs in somehow and i was afraid it might tear once i got it on it fit perfectly though getting out of it was a disaster i had to ask a saleswoman for help and was so afraid it might rip overall i was crushed that it didnt work out because the print is super cute and it is very flattering
2,i waited six weeks for this dress to arrive and was so disappointed loved the skirt part of it but the top which i guess i didnt see in photo was pleated as well made my bust look huge and it puffed out on sides would have been a wonderful summer dress flowing and cool
2,purchased this in two colors online purchased in an xs i am usually a s or xs the fit was really large in the xs and the seam on the front of the top was in the wrong place and was really unflattering returning both
2,my rating has to do with the equipment used this is supposedly a recipe is for beginners how many beginners have a dough mixer instructions for making the bread truly by hand would be wonderful
2,with in a month of use the display panel detached hinge problem detected after contacting customer support came came to know that this is my fault saying i dont have knowledge of using laptop and it will be repair on chargeable basis worst experience ever with asus what kind of military grade quality that is which easily degrade by own
2,wednesday was one of the best films ive watched on netflix not only did jenna ortega did a fantastic job of portraying wednesday the whole plot of the show was really fun too i really liked how jenna took her own turn on the character i heard that she didnt talk to any of the past wednesdays so that she could portray wednesday with her own style i liked how she always had those big eyes and she would rarely blink her whole mood and tone of her voice was perfect for the role she really was the spoiled and weird teenager also i felt like enid also did a very good job acting her own role and even though those two had two very different styles they had a really good friendship and it was so heartwarming when wednesday and enid hugged at the end if you like adventure and thrilling high school kind of films i would definitely recommend this to you i give this show a out of
2,the machine keeps hanging it has been only days now no apps are installed its already hanging every now and then the battery life is only half from what was mentioned
2,i really loved this top online and wanted to love it in person it is soft and the patter is okay in person the neckline is higher than i am used to also there are two buttons in the back that must be unbuttoned in order to wear the top it is difficult to button them behind your neck with the top on unfortunately i had to return this item
2,very quiet and makes a popping noise
2,i was so excited for this kimono i thought the colors would be lovely i was looking for a unique wrapvestkimono i ordered this online expecting to be dazzled sadly i was not this arrived and fell short on all measures the colors were flat the fabric felt cheap and the construction did not scream it felt like something i would find in a college importhead shop back it went i ended up buying the silves wrap which i love
2,too big and its not secure enough to wear for swimming
2,good product that i have used before came in wrapping all around but one leaked
2,i had been looking at this dress online hoping for a popback and when i went into my local store today there were two on the rack and one was my size i found the colors and print a bit blah i felt like it could use a little detail for the pricebead detail or embroidery in real life and i didnt love the fabric in my opinion it is a bit too stiff and doesnt drape particularly well things got worse in the dressing roomit was a disaster on me im busty and while the top fit because
2,i havent made this yet but plan on it does anyone know if i use olive oil if it will make a difference
2,unfortunately i had to make the return for product not working
2,this is a beautiful skirt but runs very small i usually wear a size and could not get the side zipper closedat all
2,if these jeans work for you youre a lucky girl the fabric is really thick and soft pocket detail is cool and the hidden multicolored button placket is a nice detail i ordered down a size theyre tight across my thighs and seem shorter than a inseam the fit is boxy and not flattering on me but pants are so cute i may keep them anyway
2,i followed the directions no adding or subtracting and this is the most tasteless chowder ive had looking through other recipes now to see what i can do to doctor it up will give it stars for creaminess but so bland
2,really enjoyed the first episode its like a deeper fantasy island with quirky real layered characters the acting was good all around and i actually enjoyed the orange filter it kind of set a certain mood that worked for me i will definatly watch the second installment update i just watch minutes of the second episode and almost nuked it really bad writing and really bad acting regarding the drug scene i am going to turn it back on and finish the episode then decide if i will give the rd episode a shot
2,its a beautiful lace designed tank top in a vibrant navy blue however the lace on the hemlines were snagged the top was much shorter than i had anticipated im returning it to the store unfortunately
2,i was really looking forward to this chili but was sadly disappointed i used ground turkey because thats what i had on hand but the flavor just wasnt what i was expecting at all i might try it again and leave out the oregano that just doesnt say chili to me based on all the good reviews i really thought i would love it but didnt
2,continuously crashing wifi laging sometimes keyboard not working overheat delay start control center worst software optimisation in power saving mode laptop hang and crash in normal task
2,i was so excited for this dress but sadly it did not meet expectations the gauze fabric already had several snagspullers in it the underslip was very short and just cleared my derriereim i normally take a and ordered this in a l it was somewhat clingy in the hip area but yet bulky on top also i like to have the first button open but you could then see the v neck of the underslip and it looked hokey its definitely a thicker material than the previous plaid tunic holding
2,season two not so much reacher is not one to take prisoners lol although i havent read the books i did think season was better overall and it is the one that kept me watching over and over again the series took a big jump in unnecessary murders in the second season the shooting down of the helicopter with the scientist and pilot seemed excessive but probably from the book it is suprising the series is not very popular in my region but is worth the wait for season looking forward to if reacher and roscoe will reunite sometime and in which town this time they did great together overall reacher will make the audience watch out for the next episode
2,monday november i put this in the galaxy s without formatting restarted the phone and it showed g gb of space i transferred all the files from the old gb card and then moved all my music to the card with the phone connected to my computer by the usb cord still lots of space left and the various music players seem to see all the musictuesday november the card didnt show up on the phone this afternoon no message just no songs to play and no card according to everything i could check on the phone i restarted the phone and got a notification that the sd card was corrupt needed formatting and that i would loose all data on the card i restarted the phone again without formatting and the card came up like it had never been missing i am writing this on thursday and i have not had another issue with the carddecember well i dont know what to think the card disappeared again and i reformatted it fat in an attempt to fix the problem the whole point of getting this large card was to have my music on my phone and not have to stream it from the cloud i tried several music players and went with poweramp because of the good reviews and that i could specify the folder to play from so poweramp is looking for the folder mntextsdcardmusic and playing the songs in all the subfolders it is poweramp that tells me that folder is not availablethe card has gone missing one other time and restarting the phone fixed the problemtoday poweramp would not play and when i got home i found the music folder was gone i also had ringtones folder and it was also gone now i may not be the sharpest saw in the shed but i know i did not delete those folders the card had other folders but not those two so it had not been reformattedi am starting to think the problem is with the galaxy s i had a gb fat card in this phone that had been in my previous htc phone that card was not large enough to held my music so i dont know if it was disappearing or not i wish this combination of phone and gb card was more reliable but just dont know where the problem liesi lowered the stars from to but i really dont know if the problem is with the card the phone or both all i know is that they do not seem to be playing well togetherdecember there was a notification on the phone this morning that the sd card was corrupted and needed to be formatted i restarted the phone several times and got the notification each time i reformatted the sd card using the phone a step i dont think i have tried yetdecember another minor problem i have is that the message counter gets stuck on when i have no new messages the only fix i have found is to restart the phone that happened this morning and i got the corrupted card message again but restarted again and the card came up okdecember so the files on the card keep disappearing the card is mounted and the phone shows the correct free memory but poweramp and file directory programs do not see any files on the card i restart the phone and the files come back very strange i played music on and off all day today without a problem and then this evening all the files disappeared again restarted the phone and all is well againdecember my phone upgraded to yesterday and the same issues remain it is a crap shoot as to if music will play i take a lot of photos and use the service zenfolio to store and display them i have an app that syncs with zenfolio and keeps a phone size version of the photos on my phone i set this app to store the photos on the samsung sd card and have similar issues with it when the data on the phone goes away this morning the sd card came up as corrupt again after a restart to get the data back it took a total of restarts to get the music and photos backdecember i have been trying to play music stored on this card today and my phone has reset several times very frustrating i ordered a sandisk gb mobile microsdhc flash memory card sdsdqgaffp today for about and ill see if i have the same issues very disappointingdecember i purchased and installed thesandisk gb mobile microsdhc flash memory card sdsdqgaffpand copied all the files from the gb card to the new gb card no formatting no fuss no muss i have not had a phone reset since have played music through bluetooth for hours in the car have viewed photos everything just works half the memory but what i have is always available and the phone works a good trade off i am still disappointed that the gb did not work with the sg i have purchased aelago mobile nano ii usb microsdhc flash memory card reader blackto use the gb microsdhc card as a thumb drive
2,dave filoni and jon favreau bravo you guys are killing it i am one of the biggest star wars fans on the planet but also one of the biggest sequel haters you will ever meet because the story sucked the writing was awful not the case with the mandalorian funny and touching the perfect balance of new and classic star wars the sounds the music the sets it feels like star wars and its all sooo good and the nd season may have been better than the first thank you to everyone involved with this production
2,this dress was too cute to pass up i loved it online but when i got it home it was so tight i couldnt zip up my normal size the length was perfect on me being the fabric and detail was beautiful if you have a bust order a size up beautiful dress just really snug up top
2,like some other reviewers i too have to comment on the dresss fit the dress doesnt fit right around the bust or the waist as a seamstress myself i know that the problem is that it doesnt have any darts in the bust and thus the bust and the waist are just about the same size this dress really just needed a few of these extra hidden details to fit right while a belt helps i dont think it helps enough to justify the price its too badi think the concept of it is cool and i was rea
2,i returned this dress because the material is so flimsy and thin i was expecting higher quality especially for the price i was disappointed it is a pretty dress and fit great but i felt like i was wearing tissue paper
2,welcome back star wars of course the bad reviews are probably from fans of tlj this series is great after two episodes and i hope it keeps it up
2,this is a very pretty sweater a bit boxy and short but cute i am and ordered the regular xs in black the thing i did not like about this sweater was the gold thread through the back lace i would have kept this if it was plain black lace just did not like that look
2,i really wanted to love this waistcoat i purchased this online and tried it on as soon as i received it it runs large but i should have realized the horizontal stripes sitting on the hips is not a good thing the fur adds additional bulk where it is not needed the hip area i purchased a small and could have purchase a xs but i think the problem would still be there in a smaller size its going back but i am disappointed as i really wanted a something a little alternative
2,cute in the on line photo but in person it looks cheap and has gold running through it if you look really close in the photo you can see it
2,everything is good handles basic gaming on high graphics camera quality must be improved too worse one more thing improve the packaging and thats it for me although i liked the product and ill use it for my studies
2,very very boxy designcut try on first or buy knowing you are likely to return beautiful skirt but if you dont have the right body typemeasurements will not flatter you at all
2,this shirt was a cute print but it was too boxy and hit too short on the thigh i considered having it taken in the waist but ultimately decided it wasnt worth paying the extra on top of the
2,i initially liked the feel and quality of the top but once it was on it was much shorter and looser than the picture of the model it flowed out from my chest with one central pleat in the front and my husband said it made me look pregnant then came the tedious task of taking it off with such a snug fit in the shoulders im regularly a size xs d and lbs and both size and did not work for me
2,i dont know what i did wrong but these did not turn out very well used sweetened flaked coconut instead of the shredded and extra large egg whites because thats what i had on hand they spread out bottom of cookie on the baking sheet and were impossible to get off the greased baking sheet maybe too much egg white anyone else have this problem good taste though
2,i loved these pants super soft and cozy and perfect for winter ive worn them a handful of times and have washed them maybe twice max and they already have holes they dont say handwash and my washerdryer is brand new and pretty gentle on my clothes maybe i just ended up with a bad pair but i found the quality to be disappointing
2,i purchased this dress in the green and while the print and material were lovely the extra folds in the neckline made the dress look frumpy up top the billowly bottom made it look like a bag i am ft d and waist and the size fit which makes me think this runs large ill be returning this dress
2,so this product is a large disappointmentbought it to use in my tablet but the card is forever getting corruptedive reformatted the card a few times but its to the point now that even a reformat doesnt work wasted moneydont recommend purchasing
2,i might be the only odd person out there who think this jacket is not perfect at all a lot of other reviewers said that the jacket runs small for me its not true at all i had to go to xxp petite to find the fit acceptable but it was simply too short rather than as it states on the website its more like which is a thing i almost never experienced because i am a petite person i dont even want to go regular size because it wouldve been too big i saw some photos that others po
2,too much fabric not a flattering top for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are
2,i have a holding horses dress similar to this one from about a year ago i loved the swinging fit without it looking like a maternity dress the fit and style of this dress is wonderful its the color that killed it for me i ordered the orange because i liked the photo on the model when the dress arrived in the mail i could hardly take it out of the package and try it on the color is almost neon orange too much for this redhead hard to wear that bright neony color not sure
2,doubled this recipe to make loaves i cooked for minutes took out of oven and began to cool it realized that it was not done and put back into the oven baked for another minutes and took out still did not seem done followed the recipe to a t do not know what happened maybe too much oil any suggestions will not make again
2,this runs super big and it just wasnt flatteringway too much fabric i wanted to love this dress
2,my baby does not like it maybe when she gets older
2,after reading the other reviewers i decided to try this out unfortunately the material does not fall nicely on me and the belt hits in an unflattering spot i like the idea but its just not a flattering cut or material going back
2,this top is too short so much so that tucking it in would be difficult the designs are lovely but the short length is putting this top back on the rack
2,its hang time in a month dont know why
2,only heating problem
2,what this show has done is recreate the magic of george lucass original movies the style and feeling of this really is amazing i absolutely love it
2,dont get me wrong this is probably cute on someone else but not me i looked in the mirror and just laughed it was that bad so if youre considering getting this size down ordered mine in large and it looks like im wearing a barrel the pink is pretty but the horizontal striping did nothing for my shape the fabric is soft im just over trying peplums
2,i love this tank it is so comfortable but it does have its flaws it rolls up every time i walk or do anything it becomes very bothersome
2,i really hate the fact that asus and flipkart are selling this device without any accessories there is no case for sale the rog tetra headphones are not for sale neither is the dock or controller anywhere to be found the lack of accessories really limit what the device is capable of you cant really connect this to your tv and enjoy it without the dock and controller and carrying it around without case might damage it the device itself is great but for anyone on the fence to purchase read more
2,the laptop doesnt come with hz as mentioned it just has hz
2,i love this series because i like the violent series and with a real scenario
2,just give star wars to filoni and john they know what star wars is and should be this is the way
2,fabric is not as rich as shown in photo dress much shorter than shown in photo shoulder area is tight and really doesnt blend with the material below this isnt going to work on very many people pear shapejust not what ive come to expect from retailer
2,i really loved this dress in the store when i tried it on the color and fabric were perfect for summer but once i got this home i noticed the placket wouldnt lay flat across the bust like shown in pictures when i went up a size it was too large under the arms so this one will sadly have to go back to the store
2,i am an very old school star wars fan i have remained a fan through all the ups and downs that the star wars universe has been put through of late even after the stomach churning nightmare that was the last jedi im still a devoted fan i really wanted andor to be good especially since obi wan was a wonderful surprise and so much better than i thought it would be unfortunately andor is just sad it like someone pasted together all the b roll footage of characters walking places and figured that the story would just write itself all and i mean all the characters are so forgettable my heart only lifted slightly in episode when the rebel camp got a fly by from a tie fighter its like getting a bowl of lucky charms with absolutely no marshmallows i cant imagine how this show can get better at this point but as i mention i am a fan so i will hang in there until the bitter boring end
2,the chevron pattern on the mintseaside version needs to be centered in the front to look right mine was totally off so i returned it and had them overnight me a new one to my vacation address unfortunately the nd suit i received was also off center that one is going back too would have loved this otherwise a quality check on this is definitely needed beware
2,seems battery issue
2,buttons were broken off when i opened the package stretchy at waist not good quality for the price
2,i have nothing to use this device with i ordered by mistake im sure its a great product but not for me
2,don t know what has happened here tim burton was part of this as far as next stupid netflix production does not surprise me still in shock that t b was involved in this and to leave a review here i need to have signs jeez oki so what else can i write not funny at all the history was not interesting at all apart from some scene it suppose to be movie for years old music was ok and probably the best part of this actors nothing special dialogues was there at least one apart dialogue there no episodes and found nice comments the last episode the worst one wow finally signs
2,it is a very neutral product itus cheap but you get what you pay for the smell is niceish but very natural not more special than any other standard shower gel the positives that it doesnut have any artificial perfume colour or chemicals in it this review was collected as part of a promotion
2,there were just too many pleats to this thing it was not flattering it looks fantastic on this model but not on me oh well
2,sadly this dress was trashed after wearing it for an hour it snagged on everything my watch my purse my necklace i had to go home change and return the dress later impractical fabric ruined an otherwise lovely dress
2,i ordered this in size xl the ivory was as pictured the lace details were welldone but the length was much shorter than on the model im ft in for reference even the sleeves were on the short side above my wrists the main problem is how much it shed just in trying it on there was fuzz everywhere so i returned it i love when retailer mixes lace into the knit of sweaters this one just didnt work out
2,i thought this would look great with skirts but all my skirts are too dressy for this tshirt thats really all it is a nothingspecial tshirt and it runs so big im usually a large or xl in tops but for this one i bought a medium and its still too big i think a small would have been fine but as i mentioned it doesnt go with any of my skirts so its not worth looking for a small
2,great fabric and color but fits like a potato sack so sad bc i would have loved it
2,i ordered this after reading through the reviews i realize the reviews were mixed but thought id take a chance unfortunately there were more things wrong than right with this dress right i loved the various colors yes it shows black but is actually brown i also loved that it was lined and the lining was semiattached to the dress with the same hitolow hemline wrong as said by others the sleeves were very tight the dress is roomy and does swing but unlike the model it isnt real
2,the quality of the shirt is top notch the fabric is lightweight and comfortable now the cons this top is cut like a square and fits wide which is not apparent in the photo definitely not for me
2,if you are over this top probably is not for you it is absolutely seethru great style and beautiful light fabric but you can see right thru it
2,i thought i would love it but it was too soupy and spicy with no pumpkin taste if i were to make it again i would another can of pumpkin one less can of tomato and one less cup of broth i would use ground turkey and no oregano
2,this tank in black is nice quality most of the fringe hangs straight and seems to be attached well its just too short and too boxy for my figure curvyhips would look good on someone who has straight hips and is not long waisted since that doesnt describe me it has to go back
2,i was so disappointed the long grain rice did not get cooked inside of the meatballs even after an hour my family tried to eat them but no one was able to finish or enjoy them since the texture was crunchy rice i did not see one other comment with the same problem what did i do wrong
2,performance wise it is beastbattery drains very fastmux switch helps in saving battery speakers are rich in sounding equal
2,the button fell off when i took it out of the bag and i noticed that all of the thread had unraveled will be returning
2,i was sooo excited to buy this top and it was such a bummer this top hangs so poorly and is so droopy under the arms its clearly poorly made and the sizing was way off on me i ordered my usual medium and it was so large and wide that i had to return it it weirdly fit perfectly in the shoulders and arm length as mediums do for me but was so wide and unflattering for my figure and athletic i really wanted to like this top and considered ordering a small to see if it would fit better bu
2,the show is directed good but it is very cliché and the social message it tries to deliver passes every other aspect and gives disturbance i cannot see anything pass the statue burnings and social constructs that this show is trying to crash it is like every other netflix show just but the difference is in this one tim burton made it more dark and twisted thats all awful scenerio with cliché characters and easy to guess plot couldve been way better thinking these people been working in this industry for years but then they bring out a highschool gen z drama and ruin the whole addams family for this small show the points i give is for the sake of good old tim burton however this is very disrespectful to bring out a show this stupid to the addams family fans such shame
2,i will not suggest to buy it because laptop inch is vary big screen and speakers are not good
2,i ordered two sizes when the package came i was skeptical as it was very light and thin both shirts were in the bag the style is just okay the shirt is extremely light weight i was not impressed with the fabric i am returning both definitely did not think it was worth the price
2,good one
2,i love the coh fleetwood jeans and since i was looking for a pair of notsoskinny skinny jeans i thought these would be great but unlike the fleetwoods which are a substantial weight denim these are very soft too soft and bag out in the first minutes the style is okay but the fabric makes them unflattering maybe if youre looking for jeans you can lounge in these will be for you because they do have the comfort equivalent of sweats
2,i was bummed about this top detail on back is pretty even so not worth it im usually an xs im lbs and it fit true to size guess i had higher expectations im feel consistently let down with what the pictures convey and the actual item when it arrives in person
2,the back of this tshirt looks cute but the front looks really weird the material in the back is quite stiff but the grey material is soft so the front gray area ends up hanging weirdly and looking uneven and messy i appreciate asymmetrical clothing but to me it looked like a patched up rag from the front it fits true to size
2,so i really loved this dress i am tall ft and the size was perfect length i would have worn it with flat dressy sandals i would say it is true to size i am not a flowy dress kind of girl but this was just the perfect amount of flow without making me feel like i was wearing a long potato sack the back is just gorgeous and unique here is why i couldnt make it mine the tube top part is completely detachable and extremely thin there is literally not much to it and im not sure it wou
2,so yellowstone its a show about an america that a lot of americans think used to exist and wish that it still did exist everyone is an arrogant ass everyone is a bully but bullying and violence and competing to be as unpleasant to your neighbor as possible is cool and results in being a winner so usa usa in the world of yellowstone all of the cliches roam freely on the plain of soulless and predictable plot lines chinese people being stereotypes on a tourist bus check biker gangs that must be beaten up for being too bikery white collar metrosexuals that must be mocked for their effete flat white drinking ways ohhhh yeah ironically this show is so successful because it gives americans a stereotype that they want to believe in everyone involved in it should be ashamed of themselves welcome to the united hates of america
2,ive been eyeing this dress for months so when it went on sale i finally purchased it now i see why its on sale the dress runs extremely large and has no shape looks like a potatoe sack and i feel like moomoo in it this will be going back to the store
2,i probably should have gone with petite this dress was just awful on the waist was nowhere near where it was supposed to be it hits me about thigh level its very unforgiving clingy and shows every bump i found the material tolerable but if worn for long periods of time i have a suspicion that it would begin to irritate my skin and be scratchy its going back
2,huge bummer this top is definitely a cropmiditop plus its cream not white like shown in the photos im returning it today
2,i brought in bbd sale the warranty of my laptop was already activated for approx days before purchase i ordered on th sept and recieved on approx days later and warranty was started already from display was look like refurbished the seal was already opened i thought of posting a return but i was already delayed in my work so i thought it better to leave pros performance beast cons battry heating issue weight of charger
2,i really wanted to love this but it was just too voluminous to be flattering i am typically a size or in dresses and jumpsuits and the medium was billowing around me alsothe elastic waist hit me low and bunched in an unflattering way it had to go back
2,i love the design thats why im going back for a smaller size i bought a medium and that size was made for someone lbs heavier than i usually im good at choosing my size online but not today if you are curvy and round like me still go for a smaller size because this dress has a lot if room also i wish more clothes would come into the stores to try on please
2,so youre thinking this is a red and black skirt right nope its an obnoxious cherry red netting with cranberry crushed velvet insets overlaid on bright red actual spandex spandex that shows every wrinkle and panty line its really god awful
2,this recipe looks exactly like the one on foodnetworkcom for paula deens pumpkin bars
2,i loved this dress when i saw it in the store the colors weight fabric love love love unfortunately i have to agree with other reviewers the pockets and the positing of the draw string made my hips look unflatteringly large i tried on a size petite which is my usual size all flowed nicely except for when you get to the pockets truly disappointed as it was beautiful in every other way but in the end i had to pass
2,this skirt is very short i ordered my usual xs petite and it was so short that the longest part ended above my ankle thats quite off because im only feet tall and i wore it pretty low on the hips it also flares out awkwardly below the knee there are vertical seems and they exacerbate the jagged appearance of the hem i was drawn to the edgy style shown in the photo but in person it looks like my year old cut up a skirt plus the fabricwhile thick and beautiful and stretchyhas a
2,i chose this one of many i found because of its rating however it was just barely okayi reduced the sugar in the syrup by a half theres enough sugar in the crumb mixture and the apples and it was still a bit too sweet the topping was heavy in both texture and taste perhaps too much oatmeal i noticed more dessert left on the plates of family members who usually clean them down to the porcelain ill look for another recipe
2,i bought this because i am very fair and hide from sunshine however this product felt good as a moisturizer however felt clingy and greazy after a few minutes after hours of waiting the cream remains sticky also no change in my skin colour i am really disappointed i advise not to buy this product
2,i was planning on wearing this at the office but it looks like a maternity blouse not flattering at all i loved the concept silky loose fitting professional but they didnt succeed its a big mess return
2,we didnt care for this at all
2,the fabric and colors of this dress are beautiful but the fit is terrible i had to go up a size to get a fit in the waist but it was then incredibly loose in the shoulders what a pity had to return
2,the show is dark dramatic exciting thrilling and highly addictive some scenes are a little too well acted and it can be a sa trigger other than that this is the best damn show ive seen in years i watched the whole show over week
2,i love the design and the fabric but the fit is just off on this dress the area around the bust is just not fitted well the wrap portion of the dress in this area gaps and does not lie flat that is an easy enough fix with a good seamstress but the waist also sat too high on me maybe im long waisted who knows so between the super high waist and the flanneltype fabric it just looked kind of like a bath robe on me i wish it werent so i was so hoping for a cool plaid dress that i cou
2,backlight is not there and its heating after using some time only
2,as soon as i pulled these pants from their packaging i feel in love with them the fabric was so soft i could not wait to get them onyeah that was not going to happen i could not pull them on not even a little bit these pants run incredibly small i ordered them twice once in my regular size and again in a larger size unfortunately i am sized out of these beauties
2,too too bad battery backup
2,maybe its because im but this top was underwhelming i felt like it was a cheap tee with a big obnoxious bow on the back it does look cute on the model so maybe its a younger top i would have felt silly wearing it
2,pthis recipe was not terrible however i do not care to make it again the family did not care for the recipe eitherp
2,worst battery backup hour hours without gaming
2,battery is very poor and refresh rate also poor
2,it stops constantly due to a resistance of the fabric that covers the button onoff it is really tiring otherwise pretty soft and its adjustable
2,two months and its already broken my kid barley used it and it still broke after less than two months
2,charging issue and battery back up also not good
2,average
2,i normally wear a medium in retailer dresses but ordered a small due to the reviews that stated how large this dress is they werent exaggerating the small was way too big for me and the xxs and xs are already sold out beware that you will have to size down at least sizes to make the dress fit similar to the model pictured it is going back for me
2,then this one is for you so disappointed upon receipt of this skirt as i had been eyeing it for a while and was excited to see it on sale based upon the pictures i thought the black stitching was just an interesting outline detail but it is actually masking this skirts ugly secret a pouch yes it literally has a pouch smack dab in the middle of your abdomen which does not lay flat the material also looks rather snag prone and already had a few pulls in spots this one
2,i just didnt like this one too rich and too seafoody and i love seafood
2,i own many blouses by tiny the arms on this blouse billow out which was not flattering or thinning on me the shirt was just blah
2,the plush is much less cute than on the photos big head and is too heavy for a baby the box inside is very large the motor of the snoring makes a lot of noise especially if you put the rest of the sounds not strong to change the noises you have to open the back of the plush each time which is not practical the only positive point in my opinion is that the sounds melodies are pleasant and well adjustable in volume i had heard good opinions about this plush but i am very disappointed and i cannot return it once opened given how you have to open the cardboard to access it very bad
2,as soon as i saw this dress i ordered iti didnt want to miss out on it i loved the lookthe colors were so fun and brighti thought it was going to be my perfect dress for an upcoming trip to hawaii i am about i ordered a pxs when it arrived i loved the feel of the fabric and the colors but was wondering what it would look like on as it was a lot of fabric i know it is to be flowing but on me it was just awful part is that the ties on the shoulder are sewn in place so i c
2,this show is phenomenal a large cast of rich complex characters evolving fullydeveloped humor when you least expect it lush settings and costumes just want you want in a period piece cant take your eyes off the screen incredible cinematography and the soundtrack though not period is perfecttop quality acting even from minor characters multiple story lines that dont compete but play together perfectly stays away from clichésexy exciting and addictive in a competitive genre this show still rises to the top truly satisfyingcant wait for season and many more after so glad i found this gem
2,heating issue at the back
2,this really was nothing special for there are much cuter tops at retailer it wasnt particularly flattering as it was very boxy so it added volume it was soft and felt like decent quality which was nice i agree with another reviewer that the ruffles feel too big overall this was just a miss for me
2,the front cream panel is completely transparenti didnt purchase because my bra showed and it would ruin the look with a cami underneath i wish the fabric were translucent not so see through
2,couldnt find any in shops so bought online thought it was fake branding because it smelled similar but not quite africa poorer product since the new labelling
2,i ordered this top in white along with the meadow rue lace sleeve top while they are the same price they arent even close in quality this top is one of the sheerest tops that i have seen the trim pocket and the laceup tie are made from sheer type material that was twisted and didnt lay right and the tag sewn inside was sewn with red thread and showed through very visible i don t think it would hold up after many washes i returned this one and ordered another color in the lace sleev
2,hitting problem and hanging laptop keyboard not working very bad experience
2,generally i am not inclined to watch series of such length but the handmaids tale left me absolutely floored it peeled away my emotional layers mixing feelings so intensely that i could hardly believe what was happening to me the character of june leads the series and you find yourself sympathizing with her admiring her and even judging her interestingly i experienced similar conflicting emotions towards the negative characters as well many times i questioned what was wrong with me but i realized that i am just an empath who experiences cinematic reality in a unique way despite this the scene where june tears fred apart like a hungry shewolf gave me a swan song of satisfaction especially with the realization that serena is becoming a handmaid herself by the way serenas portrayal was exceptionalso elegant so beautiful so unattainable and so cruel excellent the series vividly depicted the hypocrisy of humanity in each character in their own way the main theme was the struggle between two women for a child the emotions experienced in this series were nothing short of a volcano of emotions
2,britness not change
2,so disappointed in the abundance of polyester fabrics that retailer carries these days especially at this price point the pattern and style of this dress is beautiful but i will never spend two hundred dollars or even half that on a poly dress please add more linen cotton and silk
2,i really didnt expect this sweater to be so short im and there is no way it would fit me properly i honestly didnt even try it on i pulled it out of the bag and put it right back in and returned it it looks like a crop top i bought the blue which was not as rich and nice looking in person as the picture i love most things i buy through retailer but this was a swing and a miss
2,ordered this top online as i loved the colors and design but i should have listened to the other reviewers i ordered my usual size m and it was just very unflattering it was short and wide not at all like its pictured on the model needless to say it was immediately shipped back
2,not good pro
2,as a child i always felt that society subtly brainwashed girls into believing that it was their duty and sole reason for existing to procreate it was never said or directly suggested but my greatest nightmare was to be an incubator as i have never read the book i cannot say it was my awakening however watching this show has made physically ill it is everything my adolescent mind had ever dreaded and more brought to life i hope that everyone reads the book andor watches this at the very least to understand what must never be allowed to happen people must be allowed to choose their own destiny and not impose their ideology upon others i hope this is a wakeup call against complacency at the very least
2,i loved the story and the places are so beautiful i want to take screenshots as i watch it kevin costner is also great but i keep skipping the parts where monica appears because the character is so boring she is always unhappy and always complaining and keeps distracting me i am not saying i dont want to see unhappy characters but monica character is a bit cheap and too simple writers could have made her a bit more complicated but instead they went the easy way and made her always sad always complaining
2,i ordered these cards at a great price during black friday weekweekend i began loading some files music videos pics etc the first card worked without any problems the second card started giving me cyclic redundancy errors at first i thought it was my hard drive that was failing and tried to copy the same files to a flash drive which worked just fine ok maybe i received a dud and tried with another card from my purchase same results cyclic redundancy error i started searching online and found a utility via one of the reviews on amazon called htestw ran the test on both cards and it reported errors it also reported write speed of only mbsec which is way below advertised speeds these items were in retail packaging and i remember reading about the bulk package items being fakes i guess the retail package cards arent any betteri should have waited to do the refund because now i have to process the refund seperately i will test another card to see if i have better luck i wanted to leave a star but i gave stars since card worked so far i have more to testvery dissapointed because i was a fan of the sandisk ultra series for being reliable but i guess they are cheaping out on quality to increase their profit i would have been extremely upset if i used these cards for anything important
2,i was disappointed easy to make but very bland even with hot sauce i added bacon and still no flavor
2,it was just ok
2,just dont buy track pad is worst you can see in the market it will start jerking behavinh randomly after sometime i am using it by disabling the track pad with a external mouse updating intel graphics driver will disable the screen brightness dimming option no support from manufacturer to fix this issue it appears they updated the motherboard for intel th gen but other io chips are years old
2,this top was just not flattering im and medium build and the m was very bulky and the fabric didnt fall in the right places made me look very round and im not so its definitely going back
2,unfortunately we didnt like napkins my son was rather irritated by him than calmed down
2,i was given this card in october to add to my new samsung galaxy s i was thrilled i copied a ton of music onto the card and used my phone as my mobile ipod substitute leaving my ipod classic on my desktop in its speaker system cradleeverything worked fine until a couple of weeks ago i started getting messages that seemed to say that i had removed and inserted the memory card of course i hadnt touched it then a few days ago the phone told me that the card contained unsupported files and that i needed to reformat it well i tried reformatting after that nothing nothing at all i pulled the memory card reset the phone reinserted the card nothing i tried the card in the adapter on computers it wasnt even visiblei called sandisk tech support it didnt take terribly long to convince them that i had a problem but they quickly offered me two gb cards as a replacement i literally laughed at them i got the disturbing sense that this is something that they are required to try if so thats a lousy business practice after bouncing me around a few time they agreed to send me an rma and a shipping label i duly sent the card off a couple of days ago to be frank i have no idea at all when i might receive a replacementif i werent already in the grips of sandisk i would buy another card the fact that of the comments here are negative is an indication of a real quality control problem a fail rate is simply unacceptable for a product such as thisupdate well i do have to give sandisk credit for customer support i returned the card using the supplied ups label on a tuesday and i received a replacement by ups on the following monday thats very good service it does however increase my suspicion about the offer of two gb because the gb cards were out of stock if they were out of stock they sure got in stock in a big hurry in any event ive upped my rating to two stars
2,this tunic only barely resembles the photo in person first the color is much less saturated and more orangey than it appears in the photos second its huge im and typically wear or p in retailerpolgies shirtsdresses i ordered the sp and the dress was at least times wider than it needed to be it hung off me completely boxy and shapeless and the style doesnt really lend itself to use with a belt
2,i was so excited to receive this dress i got a petite as i am it was very hard to zip up the side zipper but not impossible it didnt look good on me the waist line was a bit too highmaybe a regular would have looked better also i thought it was a cotton dress but it isnt also i looked like i was going to a nordic folk festival to do a traditional dance i had been so excited to receive this but sadly it just didnt work for me and i had to send it back
2,not convinced that smell matches original seems less thick than previous why does description refer to batteries other reviews show as verified purchase but none have names
2,made this for christmas and nobody liked it i thought it was okay but nothing special enough to make again this is not going in my recipe book needless to say
2,the quality of charger is too low there are power indicators on the keyboards and charger the rj connector is poorly built the touch pad right click is too hard to press
2,unforgiving to even your smallest imperfections
2,weave on the sweater quite open and easily snags the first day i wore it the seam on the sleeve began to unravel needed to use a crochet hook to reweave after the first wearing not confident that it will hold up well to its first wash
2,the fit of this top is nothing like in the photo the blouse on the model must be pinned back to achieve that fitted silhouette in reality this top is baggy and boxy and runs at least one size large the embroidery details and soft material are great but the fit is off entirely this item is going back
2,i so wanted to love this tank and was so excited to get it in the mail i got a size small my usual and it ran so large i wasnt even sure an xs wouldve fit properly the material looked lighter and blousey on the model but in person is much thicker and sort of hangs underarms run large and are gaping from the body i am sad to return this top because i love the color and idea of it but it just cant work on me
2,the slumbery otter is a good idea and my boy finds it classy however our otter either has a wobble contact or is already broken after a very short time instead of min the functions run out within secondsfor the price not again disappointing
2,display quality is not goodam not satisfied with this
2,i noticed a long time ago that even when not really running at very fast speeds and im mostly talking about reading as mostly it was playing music and video files this card seems to get fairly warm after a while pretty much just outside the point at which i could rma it it started randomly disconnecting at first i thought it was my phone though i had no clue why it would ever do such a thing so i wouldnt have sent it in at that point anyway it always seemed to be fine when i plugged it into my computer over time it got worse and worse and i would have to remove and put it back in quite a few times to get it to finally work eventually it started doing this on the computer too and thats when i realized something was fishy i switched to another card in my phone and the problems went away on the other hand this one stopped working completely a bit later even in the computermaybe i just got a bad one but right now id rather get a different one instead if i were to buy a new one
2,these were too sweet for me
2,i couldnt wait to try this on this sweater sadly it was too large in all ways the sleeves are adorable but the ruffle overwhelmed my arms this was much longer on me than the model it stopped midthigh the quality seemed fine but it is a thin sweater
2,these have a very interesting cut it seems like they were made for someone extremely tall im about and the size fit in the waist but fell way below where they do on the model on the picture its hard to imagine who they would look good on theyre also very poofy right below the waist
2,this pie was a soupy mess i even followed the advice of another reviewer and reduced the juices and sugars of the apples before assembling the pie also the apples were very thinly sliced and did not cook through after minutes of baking when the crust was done the flavors were very good but the way it baked up was unacceptable especially for so much work id be less disappointed if i had used a store bought crust and saved the time and effort will not make this again
2,the past bags of these the tablets are spilt
2,gift for my little girl who is months oldis it normal that there is not a manual for usemusic stops at the end of a minute while it is specified m
2,its a beautiful top but not for bigger busts ordered an xl and the top part would not button i recommend for those with smaller busts
2,as is only a because there is no tasteflavor i may make this again with these changes id put the pineapple juice in the cake in place of the water i may tried putting a nd can of pineapple in the cake to for more flavor if that doesnt do it then i could try the trifle as others suggested this is something that feels light after a meal
2,very high production story excellent storybelievable storyline one of the best produced shows everim impressed its smaller storylines might not scale those heights but they broaden its reach and enrich our understanding melanie lynskey appears as a rebel leader in kansas city where we also meet a young man on the run with his kid brother we see how ellie ended up where she is in an episode aching with nostalgia and we see attempts to create utopias in an environment that is dystopian to the bone in tiny pockets it dares to hope i loved its balance of horror and heart it burrows under the skin and refuses to leave
2,this product looks great on the model but for anyone with a normal body type the band in the center is way too tight im a a and wear a pants and it was huge in the bust and too small in the waist and hips the violet one looks much more blue in the photograph it is truly lavender and purple i really wanted to love this swimsuit but instead i had to return it pay for return shipping and i am out about now very disappointed
2,i havent done any formal benchmarks but the device seems pretty slow i havent seen any real performance boost vs my old card even on bulk file copies i have another gb samsung card that may be a knockoff that performs noticeably better than this cardim using it anyway i dont really have the time to return it or anything
2,display is most worst part in this device then after battery backup less than hr my bad experience with flipkart and than after i never purchase any electronic item from flipkart
2,for the first two months the card worked great in my gopro hero black edition then one night it randomly stopped working amazon wont take it back and ive got an email into sandisk to see if i can get it replaced now im out and now cant use my camera thanks so little
2,i ordered the white denim online and was very disappointed by how thin the material was i had tried on the light blue denim in the store and it had a nice weight to it the style is wonderful and the fit is very flattering but too sheer for me to wear outside the house
2,month hinge brocken bad quality
2,tasty but otherwise a flop top layer separated from caramel by the time i sawed thru the caramel the nougat layer was smashed am an experienced cook but these bars made me look like a beginner i would love to hear if anyone was able to cut these neatly enough to put on a serving tray if someone didadd details to the recipe as it stands i will never waste the time and money on this recipe again
2,i was so excited to get this in the mail and so disappointed when i put it on it had a nice feel to it and fit well when i zipped it up but i dont really know how to adequately describe what it looked like when i glanced in the mirror lumpiness along the seams i dont know if it was a manufacturing flaw or not but it gave me lumpylooking hips and then kind of clung around my midthigh area returned it the next day
2,this blouse has such a beautiful print but then it just goes down from there and cant be saved the fabric is a sheer silk so it comes with an attached camisole that just doesnt lay right underneath the sleeves are all gathered up and they have a puffy gather at the top that just ruins the whole blouse i wish it was just a simple popover type blouse because it really is a lovely print definitely not worth the money even at off plus
2,product ok but heating problem with in minutes laptop is full heating
2,i really wanted to like this shirt the quality is amazing and much prettier in person but it is hard to take care of if you wash it the wrinkles are horrible so it has to be dry clean only also the back is ridiculously long it looks very odd from the side view
2,i ordered my usual medium the tops length came only to my waist and was wide and unflatering the armholes were right under my arms too bad as this looked so cute in the picture i returned
2,not too bad an adaption of the books and a good drift from the films worth a watch if youre in any doubt reacher is just in case you missed it mentioned every scene
2,after days one side sound ded
2,i had such high hopes for this blouse as it looks totally stunning online however its not as pictureddescribed in that it is totally sheer and the brand is not floreat but rather hd in paris for the price the quality is just not thereive seen comparable shirts at other stores for much less i returned it without a second thought
2,set in what i believe is supposed to be the future offred aka june is a handmaid because most of the women and men in this future usa now called gilead are infertile and she had a previous successful pregnancy and birth when she was married while trying to escape from gilead to canada june her husband and child are caught and separated june is sent to a camp where she is taught all the new ways of doing things most of it shocking and brutal im not going to go into the whole storyline as by now you know what its about i am going to say if this show elizabeth moss and aunt lydia dont win an emmy or golden globe i will be shocked there are maybe two or three tv shows on the air at this time that i will never miss and this is one of them although i believe it is only on hulu right now as it is an original hulu series it can be scary because the people that now control gilead appeared to do it so effortlessly while most of the residents seemed completely apathetic to what was happening all around them reminds me a bit of what is happening in this country right now with our rights slowly being eroded in the name of homeland security
2,i dont know how to explain but this dress at least for me did not look like the model first off the dress is extremely heavy and extremely long and then where the fur starts for me it didnt start at the right spot so it was very awkward looking so definitely not for my type of body i am normal height athletic and curvy body but maybe for a very tall person looks good the material is very interesting its so soft
2,all over product is good as per prrice but the speaker performance no good very low sound
2,i tried on this top and it looked fine until i tried to move you cant lift your arms i tried on a larger size but still felt like the movement was limited in the back and arm areas
2,this is a beautiful sweater with deep rich colors i purchased the blue motif the problem is that the models are small busted which allows the side panels and front panel to lay nicely and swing in a flattering manner i am pounds and a d i usually wear a small in antro tops i purchased this online and was excited upon its arrival when i tried it on i was horrified it looked like a babydoll maternity sweater on me the front did not lay well flat at all from the chest d
2,the laptop battery is so scary
2,loved the material and the style unfortunately my fears came true when i received this swimsuit and there wasnt enough support despite a review i had read as a d i thought the halter would be enough support however the material is too stretchy to rely on that completely i am sad i wont be keeping this though the material is heavenly
2,had to return ordered an xs which usually fits perfect b chest and it was falling off shoulders and chest it was like a sleeping bag huge fan of retailer but there is a design flaw in this sweater
2,i wanted to love this shirt so much i got this as a gift for christmas in the black the first time i wore the shirt of the buttons on the back fell off keep in mind that they are not decorative and they held the shirt together needless to say i was not so pleased to have my shirt fly open from the back retailer and their amazing customer service took this shirt back no problem but i wanted to give the fair warning
2,how could anyone compare to christina riccis wednesday i thought going in to this jenna ortega nearly did possibly would have if the story didnt focus on her and she could have just deadpanned oneliners here and there like crs wednesday did but since the show is all about her well shes darn awesome jr is definitely my second favorite wednesday behind ricci which is saying a lot because melissa hunters adult wednesday addams was pretty amazing as well i wont give away any spoilers ill simply say this is a must see entry for any addams family fans i like luiz guzmans gomez better than john astin but not as well as raul julia catherine zetajones is servicable as morticia but no one will every be able to own role as carolyn jones did and anjelica huston was a little more enjoyable as well the supporting nevermore cast were all quite good as well do yourself a favor and watch this its fun even if you arent a addams family junky
2,this could have been an amazing chemise but it is too short even for bed perhaps it could be used for a tank i am but do have a long torso it did not fully cover my booty
2,i tried on this sweaterlove the flowing top and it looked like the seam would hit right under my bustline wrong the seam came right across my bust on a medium sized up to a large same thing this shouldnt happen not sure who this would actually flatter the sweater is high quality and the colors are perfect the fit needs work
2,we did not like this at all it was too salty from all the packaged mixes i will not be making this again
2,this sweater has the weirdest stitching although the buttons on the sleeves are a nice touch and the hunter green color is to diepoor fit means poor sweater
2,the characters are all strong in different ways what i really find amazing by this series is that you get an insight in all the good and bad guys and why they have become who they are the writer once said that all the things in the story is inspired by things that actually happens around the world from my point of view this is a must see or read
2,actually a nice music box however the engine is so loud that you have to make the melody very loud to hear it
2,this macaroni salad was ok but ive had better flavor was a bit bland for me
2,dont buy
2,laptop is good but the paint on laptop body is of poor quality
2,much of the buzz about the handmaids tale is that this is what could happen if america turned into a christian theocracy im not a religious person but i dont see how anything in the show matches up with any christian doctrine religious people i know dont have practices that match anything in the handmaids tale especially the part about keeping a mopey girl around the house so you can bang her to have kids yeah i know the women are infertile but wouldnt a clinical method of getting the mope pregnant be more likely this dystopian future is highly structured with plenty of cultural taboos and enforcement infrastructure how did this all get implemented all the characters have a recent history so this societal reboot happened in a span of five years i cant imagine it in america gays have been a political force for years and they just recently got the right to marry as others have mentioned not much really happens none of the characters have any charisma or are likable the viewer is supposed to be sympathetic to the handmaids they have no freedom and are essentially property as the show drags on i start noticing other people i feel sorry for the guards who have to stand on the sidewalk holding a machine gun all day thats it just stand there at least the handmaids can chat with each other and are in a comfortable house if you love this show its because you make yourself love it or you are politically insecure and like to be frightened there are many other shows you can watch that are much more engaging
2,i agree its not as good but the bridge is a and this is at least a its certainly not deserving of the ridiculously low ratings some have given it its early yet so the ratings a bit high at but itll end up being in the high s and thats about right im certainly glad i watched it very entertaining and much better than most the recent crime shows out the bridge babylon berlin and bosch were fantastic but those are older shows referring to other reviews comments as was criminal minds i have to say this is the best in a good while you certainly dont want to miss it
2,i had high hopes for this top but it didnt work for me at all it shows your bra straps perfectly plus it was so big and boxy that it made me look about pounds heavier no thanks
2,a bit too rich for my taste if i make it again i think i would do a light whipped cream topping with strawberries rather than the frosting from this recipe which just felt like too much
2,unlike the other two reviews i found this dress horrid i ordered a xs since i am between that and a s it was just too much fabric for me i have a small frame so it was just so overwhelming the armholes were big and i felt like i had a bag on me colors were nice and fabric was soft and light the belt made no sense as others have said length was good i tried it on as soon as i got it and couldnt take it off fast enough i literally ran to the post office and back it goes this is my
2,these felt like they were cutting off circulation around the calves i tried pulling them lower to reduce the tightness but that made them way too droopy between the legs an alternative would be to clip the elastic but ultimately decided to return
2,the pump design on the large bottle is horrible it is impossible to determine which end the lotion will come out by looking at the pump how many carpets and pieces of furniture are being ruined by the pump design
2,very disappointed runs small in chest and too long the fabric is cheap but the print is pretty with the bead and flower detail i dont think this dress is worth the price it is not even silk and the underlay feels like cheap gauze i have been in the fashion industry for over years and this is a miss mark in my opinion put it back on the rack and save your for something better at sweet retailer
2,i anticipated receiving this skirt as i love a longer pencil skirt and this looks beautiful i opened it tried it on sent it backit is well made but has too many negatives first it is very thick i ordered size lbs the size was good but it is so thick that it adds lots of extra fluff around the waist and abdomen it is also very stretchy and fits in an unflattering way finally and most importantly it has a back and front vent and both are vented all the way up to the c
2,thus microsd card worked fine for a year in my samsumg note ii i mostly used it to listed to downloaded music from spotify it has actually failed twice when it failed the first time the phone couldnt see that i had a card installed i thought maybe something had merely corrupted it so i formatted it put it back in my phone and redownloaded all my playlists it worked for two months and then failed again i dont plan to try formatting it again ill switch to a different brand of card
2,i didnt mind the scratchiness others proclaimed this garment had but it is made very tight in the arms and across the back looks great from the front but uncomfortable
2,very delicate poor hardware surely not a good laptop
2,performance wise its better but the display given was worst in quality if u clean display with normal cloth its get numbers of scratches i think dont waste your money on such a cheap product increase your budget and buy better laptop
2,i loved this dress it fit perfectly everywhere except for the sleeves the dress has an overall relaxed fit but the sleeves were way too tight i had to send back because of sleeves
2,after reading every review i was certain i knew exactly what i was getting with this dress wrong i sized up from a small to a medium and the dress was still uncomfortably tight on my rib cage the top is very exposing of the bust and im small busted i cant stand wearing camis so there no way id be able to wear this dress even if i sized up again to a large for reference im a straight build lbs and wear a pluses on this dress are i loved the green color and length of sk
2,i loved the design and material of the test but unfortunately it just did not fit me right it was tight in the hips and did not have the relaxed look i was hoping for also the pattern did not look good on me unfortunately i had to return
2,too salty for us but id love to find a similar recipe with less salt
2,i am lbs the small fit well in the bust but no shape it was just big and frumpy it went back
2,system very slow hanging issue
2,murder she wrote but not for the fainthearted the reacher we want a soldier hyper intelligent very fit and sometimes very down to business he actually kills to survive in a mean way
2,i ordered a size and it was huge on me very loose fitting dress i didnt like the material either
2,this is such a beautiful dress but have to return for the reasons others have noted the chest does not fit well
2,i love the design and fit and quality have been looking for a longline top like this and was willing to pay full price i have that dreadful little roll right under my bust line and this sucks everything in nicely smooths it all out im a c and everything was contained nicely and fit great in the large top heres my issue wore it once and the colors ran i was so excited to wear this i didnt even wash the top i rinsed and dried the bottom though and im not a swimmer just let
2,first let me say i love the fabric and the pattern of the blue dress but the fit is extremely loose they could take out an entire inches of material and it would still be a swing dress the photo of the back of the model where the blue dress goes in to her waist is not at all accurate if it was i would love this dress the photo of the model wearing the other color is how the dress actually hangs straight down from the underarms and then bigger as it goes toward the hemline i am
2,this top runs huge not only in the torsochest area but the sleeves on this were enormous and the shoulder area was very puffy i am normally between a ml but would have to get a small or extra small to make it work
2,this is a beautiful dress but unfortunately it is only for women who are not well endowed it is extremely well fitted in the chest the high waste also poufs out due to a lot of extra material and the double lining a beautiful dress but a very very poor construction also there are bright blue and yellow beads in the chest area that are a bizarre combo to the corals and browns of the fabric i am normally a at retailer and the was extremely small
2,i followed recipe to a t have made muffins for years but these turned out dense
2,ive only watched the first episode but plop is ruining the show i could be honeymooning with alexandra daddario in a holding cell on an artificial disputed island in the south china sea and have a smile on my face
2,my family and i were not a fan of this recipe it was so thick with all the flour and we couldnt taste anything but thyme it was a bit salty as well the seasonings were just overpowering i think this would better suit my families tastes if the seasonings and flour were cut in half
2,i bought this dress to wear to an out of state wedding first time wearing when i tied the strap the pull through at the top of the halter broke with minimal stress i sewed it back with a repair kit from the hotel but was worried the whole night the dress would not hold up if this is all that is holding the dress on it should be more secure with reinforced stitching beautiful material and comfortable
2,poor built quality
2,the photo of the mila turtleneck where model has her hands to her sides and just below her hair there is a bit of extra fabric which falls to the bottom of the sweater in a bit of a pleat well its not representative of the abundance of fabric in the xl i usually wear an l or xl well with retailer clothing the excess added the appearance of excessive pounds from breasts to bottom of sweater bummer ill be returning it
2,super soft fabric however very short in the stride i ordered an xl normally wear i had to return it
2,i loved it and it has been very useful to sleep my baby but it has lasted days to spoil it no longer breathes and the sounds stop at the very beginning
2,this top looks great on the model a petite frame smallbusted body i am and have a large bust and curvy hips this top hit in all the wrong places the front looks very cropped and frumpy if you have a large bust the width of the top of very boxy the top is very soft and comfortable and the color is pretty
2,i was worried about this item when i ordered it because of how it looks in the picture but i had wishful thinking i should have gone with my gut this shirt does not have the same quality as all my other retailer purchases it is seethrough and flimsy the bottom is just like the picture it hangs in an odd rumpled way the top is very flattering though so its a shame if the bottom fit nicer like their other products i could have gotten away with wearing a cami under it to make up for the qu
2,i know weve gotten to the point that polyester can be acceptable but sometimes its still that horrible texture unbreathable mess unfortunately thats what this top is made out of so it runs big its billowy and cute but i couldnt get it off quick enough because of the feel of the fabric
2,i ordered a large and despite wearing a large in many other items from antrhopologie this item was too small especailly across the bust it was very wellmade and the color green is beautiful but unfortunately i will not be able to wear it so disappointed
2,this dress either runs large or just has too much fabric ordered my usual size but it is too long and too baggy to do a thing for me embroidery pretty but background is more of a muddy gray then denim as shown if the smaller size in petite was available id have exchanged it but it is going back
2,runs big and looked unflattering i am petite might work on someone taller
2,an absolutely gorgeous but poorly fitting blouse the bottom part is way too billowy and inconsistent with the fitted top half got it on sale and still returned it
2,i like the dark humour of the family addams how it is almost creepy this series was disappointing in the sense of it was way too kids friendly i mean it tried being darkcreepy and had some great jokes and characters tim burton did a great job but his style did not show through in every aspect where it was very much needed like the storyline but if i feel comfortable letting a tenyearold watch this then it isnt really the level of creepydark i expected when watching as an adult i wished we saw some more of wednesday in an ordinary school after watching the trailer that dynamic was really interesting and outside that trailer segment there was nothing more basically the plot here was nothing special honestly a storyline we seen way too many times before and it fell flat i found this mediocre where the good pointers were mellowed down with bad ones did not regret watching it but definitely not a favourite
2,cute enough but i couldnt figure out what to do with the tie that didnt make it look like an extra set of sleeves oddly placed
2,i substituted applesauce for the oil and it turned out way too moist the toothpick came out clean but the bars actually had a gummy texture i should try the recipe again as the original recipe reads but honestly i dont like any recipe with that much oil i also tried chocolate chips sprinkled on top of half of the bars a jelly roll pan makes a lot of bars so i wanted to try them different way it was a bad idea the bars did not have that choc chip pumpkin muffin sense at all i do agree with many others that the recipe was super easy to put together at least i have something good to add
2,this is cut very strangely im short waisted and this barely covered my belly button the material is rough and scratchy did not like at all and will be returning
2,i was eager to try this from the great reviews but did not care for this at all the major seasonings are chili powder and cumin which give the enchilada sauce on the top an odd flavor and sauce is very thick this ended up being just a pile of mush when you take it out of the oven and not enchilada flavor at all
2,i am absolutely shocked that so many people love this dress maybe i should have sized up and reconsidered but i still dont think it would have worked the fabric is very soft but thats where its qualities for me ended the knot felt huge to me and definitely added unnecessary size to my already curvy hips for reference im and hourglass dd the cut at the bottom also felt very strange and restrictive to me like i would have had to take smaller steps to walk around in it
2,i love relaxedfit wide leg pants with some pockets and draw string so naturally i was super excited to see these i got them in gray and they felt and looked perfect right out of the bag material was soft and flowy but not too thin unfortunately the sizing is completely off unless i got a defective pair i got my usual size l and they felt like s or smaller i barely could get them on and i could not zip up id need at least two sizes larger for them to fit at all very disappointed will l
2,i took advantage of the summer tag sale and bought a few tops including this one ive been eyeing this online for quite some time so i was pretty excited to get it at such a good price it came in the mail the other day its like christmas morning when you see an retailer package at your door however this time wasnt so great the top is fine average at best the top fits true to size maybe its the pattern or the cut but it didnt work well on my body i recommend trying this on first
2,im pretty sure its the best tv show ive watched and ive watched a whole lot the character development is amazing every character is unique yet interesting and vital for the progression of the show the writing is phenomenal and the setting is also on point the way the viewer feels about the characters and the amount of complexity and depth of their personalities is also worth mentioning the acting of course is perfect not only murphy but everybody delivers an awesome performance great ost that consists of artists like the white stripes the arctic monkeys nick cave david bowie leonard cohen what else to ask for youll definitely love it
2,it just didnt work for me i dont know if it is my fair complexion and untanned legs but this dress was a strike out the orange floral design and beading is beautiful and the fitting i would say is pretty tts for reference i am and lbs with measurements and i purchased a medium the chest and arms were not too tight like other reviews stated the length is about the length in the picture and a lot of fabric to make it very flowy overall very good quality and beautiful
2,cant wait for more they did a great job casting and scene designs
2,season good but season goes downhill fast story bad editing many boring flat dream scenes nonsensical wanting to leave then go back then lrave then go back is just ridiculous and getting silly and repetitive now season so predictable the acting in season isnt as polished as seasons either watching season im losing interest already
2,i just received this in the mail today first of all there was no slip included and the fabric is totally sheer the description says viscose lining so i assume there was a slip and from the picture it looks like it was a beige color second of all it was obviously sent from a store where they lost the slip and it was squished into the smallest possible retailer envelope the fabric is beautiful but the dress is humongous like the previous reviewers said i ordered a size smaller than us
2,as others have said this is cropped so will look funny with most pants that arent high waisted im going to try it with a few dresses before i return it the lining is adorable so i dont want to have to send it back
2,i tried this on in the store and was disappointed because it looked so fresh and vibrant on the hanger but its basically cut for modelsized people only its short and wide and if you have any boobs at all itll make the back pucker i cant imagine this will look good on most women
2,the screen was not so good very colur fade and also battery backup was not good
2,very poor display my phones speaker is like dj if i talk about its speaker
2,i bought this dress in an xs and am lbs and fairly proportional the shoulders were snug but the hips and maybe waistwere at least x too big comically so the fabric stood away from my body like wings on each side
2,i love byron lars dresses and this design is onpoint the ruffle at the neckline is so pretty and the dress fits like a dream however the fabric i would have loved it if this dress had a heavier feel this is sadly going back today
2,doesnt feel like cotton jersey feels like a thin version of the seamless cami its not soft as i expected its much thinner than expected too
2,bazaar to say the least most of the characters are unlikable the music is very distracting not sure ill complete the series since i cannot get into any of the hotel guests only likable characters the masseuse at least she has some dimension
2,i received this article already in december because i expect young people in june and really looked forward to it after all the awards on instagram and co i noticed already at the first commissioning that one attitude gives an incredibly disturbing noise of itself and that the engine is still very loud during the breathing movement in my opinion therefore not at all suitable for newborns or babies the functions themselves are really sweet so i ordered it again in the hope that it was a sunday model unfortunately this was not the case
2,i thought this suit would be the perfect solution of stylish but forgiving of my new mom bod this one didnt work for me i ordered the medium the top is very smalli would recommend only for b cup or smaller the full coverage bottoms did nothing for my shape it seemed to make me seem rounder and shorter sending this one back i did find success same size in a faux wrap style retailer suit
2,this top was originally way overpriced so i ordered it on sale for half price still overpriced it arrived yesterday and frankly i am disappointed the quality is not great it is like a jersey type material doesnt look like the photograph at all i like the color but frankly thats about it
2,i assumed at the price point this would be a high quality tshirtsweater unfortunately it is made of cheap looking material that is acrylic and seethrough
2,i saw this sweater online and have been looking for a unique sleevless sweater for some time now its a very beautiful sweater so i ordered it right away when i saw this design i recieved the sweater in the mail and really wanted to love it but it just wasnt for me its very well made and thick which i liked but i usually fit in small sized tops for retailer but they didnt have a small left in the sizes i ordered a medium and it still ran small i was very surprised its was also disappointing
2,season there was some solid acting and story lines that made the season worth a weekend binge couldve done without the very graphic sex scene but i guess its hollywood so why should we be surprised season this was by far my favorite season i found the characters more layered and interesting it was well written and acted season there were moments that could have developed into something good but overall the season fell flat not one character was likeable the episodes were incredibly boring and i found myself fast forwarding a lot what an epic failure i hope they dont make any more
2,when i saw this blouse online i thought it looked like a great combination of casual with the elegance of an intricate print i was so disappointed when it came the print is not centered in the front or the back it looks like they were trying to save on the material and just cut it out wherever with no thought to symmetry for this price the detail of centering the design was expected especially because this is how it appeared in the picture loved the blouse but i will be returning it becau
2,looks lovely in the picture but looks poorly made in person runs very small i returned it
2,i thought the photo of these pants was so cute when i got them in the mail i opened the package and just began to laugh over how long they were i held the waist up to my chest just below my shoulders and the pants still hit the ground i am not a short woman i ordered a i am i also found the waistband a little small in relation to the size
3,the wine color is beautiful and the idea of a knot front with different back is a good one however both fabrics are thin and the back is quite see through the knit shows every single bodily imperfection so if you are the quintessential tall and thin and you dont mind showing your bra go for it otherwise i suggest skipping this one
3,wanted to love these pants they are way way too long im lbs for reference i didnt love the way they looked cuff and didnt think it was worth having them hemmed loved the color would work well for someone tall and slim
3,this shirt flows beautifully and the fabric is almost wrinkle free i also love that its the perfect weight and not too low cut and that the buttons are covered however the stitching started to come undone the first time a wore it i didnt even wash the shirt yet sadly i dont think i can recommend this shirt though maybe give it a try i might have got a defective one oh this shirt also seems to run a bit large through the body but it still looks great i hope this helps
3,value for money
3,dang i got a small and was still swimming in it its made of the fabric that increasingly seems to be the fabric of choice for all things tshirty soft and thinish a bit translucent id rather wait for something more formfitting and flattering back it went
3,good cast world building is good acting is really good overall good show
3,i ordered these pants in black and brick the pattern is great but the sizing and fit are way off i usually wear an or a medium in retailer i ordered these pants in a and petite the actually fit but there is no stretch in these fitted pants they were very uncomfortable to walk or sit in however if youre standing up all day and not doing much moving around these pants are perfect the print is great in both black and brick i couldnt decide which one i liked best wish th
3,love this top although it ran very small in bust and arms im normally a medium will have to return for a large
3,i purchased this dress to wear to a beach wedding i loved the color the fit and the style i even got a lot of compliments on it the problem was that the wedding was on the beach in florida degree weather and when you are sweating the fabric changes colors and takes a really really long time to return to normal unfortunately i had to return it would be great to wear indoors just watch getting water or anything else on it
3,just love this show tough uncompromising characters highlighting many issues that abound in todays society costner is brilliant in this just cant get enough of this show when season came out i binged the entire seasons times cant wait for season bring it on
3,this top was quite voluminous when i purchased it and i sized down to an xs however after hand washing it once in cold water it has shrunk significantly it still fits but something to be aware of
3,this sweater is beautiful and well made but i found the cut strange and unflattering i ordered it in my usual size small and it was too big in the shoulders and arms with a lot of fabric bunching up under my arms but it just fit me in the chest and would be too tight if i sized down this might work for you if you are not busty and order a size down from your usual
3,i bought this dress in a regular xs i am and pounds i have a long torso so the regular would fit better than the petite although the overall fit of the dress was good the straps could have had about an inch taken out and the pockets gaped open in the photo the modes arms are laying over where the pockets would be which fall on the seam and when i tried this on the dress fit beautifully but the pockets gape open on the sides and it looks like little wings from the front the dre
3,alls good but battery decrease rapidly and also some heating issue otherwise everything is okay
3,was looking forward to june bringing down gillead and the show ending but now i see another season hard to keep watching
3,the greatest television show of all time so far the layers and nuances are beyond anything ive ever seen each character how they interact with each other how the story unfolds as a result and amplifies all these elements its incomparable each series is a cascade of layers that increasingly reveals more and more about each character until we reach the core its an elaborate morality tale the characters serving as cautionary tales that allow the audience to look inward do you see yourself in these characters lets hope so thats where the opportunity for growth lies anyone who reduces this to cringe or says the characters are so unlikable is only speaking to their own stupidity this is shakespeare in america
3,this dress is beautiful it just swallowed my small frame whole the colors and design are gorgeous just not a good fit for me even at a p
3,i like it comes in handy fits good with my galaxy s smartphone no problem with filing data on a computer
3,the fabric is super soft and the grey is pretty but it is light grey not dark grey as described when you select to buy it my biggest issue with the top is that the cold shoulder arm reveals the entire arm so if you arent completely toned with your tricep and all over arm it will show which is why i bought this to hide my blunders
3,no spoilers jon favreau is at his best with this series he created from the cinematography to the character development and adding in some star wars cannon this series keeps you on the edge of your seat
3,runs large very stretchy nice wash mine had more holes and fraying in the legs than i expected i returned them because i got the wrong size and smaller sizes are sold out otherwise a cute jean and with the sale certainly worth it
3,everything is fine except the battery battery drains very fast
3,i really wanted to love this dress the striped material was very nice and would go with so much plus the length was great however the buttons were a nightmare the buttons are barely in the button holes and give very easily the linen material is going to give even more with wear and the button holes are sure to loosen up even more as i was trying the dress on and moving around two different buttons gave way on me maybe the very slender will be able to wear this without buttons sliding out
3,ive never been one to knock the tom cruise movies watching the first one is what got me reading the books however this guy looks much more like the reacher from the books and being a series allows more of the book to come out than a minute movie having said that and im not trying to sound like a prude but there were more fbombs in one episode than in every jack reacher book ive read combined obviously with the books being so successful those are not necessary
3,battery issues
3,great print terrible quality the material is paper thin not at all what i look for in a robe its going back
3,ive read a lot of comments rating this show with complaining about plastic armor honestly you expected real stainless steel plate or perhaps dymeritium armor get real the armor design of nilfgaardians is questionable yes but for me it wasnt at all distracting which is good the cintra armor was great geralts armor while not the same as the games or missing a few details from the books it serves fantastically in a tv show where it conveys the overall feel of a witcher but doesnt distract had to adjust the volume because of the mumbling maybe your moms basement doesnt have all that good acoustics or you have hearing problems as well as stingy with a pair of headphones sound system the sound was good the voice was great good job henry and the music was okay low budget because these people in particular are very well informed in the costs associated with producing a series sarcasm i will say this though in two or three scenes the cgi is good not great but i appreciate that they tried to work around it on some points george lucas style the mage spells witcher aard sign looks amazing the dragon looks a little anorexic when compared to what im used to but this a new world with new beasts and im prepared to accept this in terms of actual costs as far as i could see they spent a great deal on it more that they did on got the story is too fragmented all over the place i see some more sense in this but still not enough to rate it the loose ends are mostly tied up in episode and since they are based on books im just going to say that the books are similarly fragmented so no points for you yennefer and xyz are dark skinned i really didnt even noticed it until some illuminated race hunter pointed it out she looks white and she fits the role tbh i will say this though some of the forced racial casts in the show dont make sense but they dont really put you off from the overall story except that its supposed to be a very racist world where people hate other people because they have pointy ears doesnt make sense for them to ignore skin color but i kind of gotten used to this agenda its not the shows or actors fault putting a little imagination in it helps accept the diversity in a logical manner as to how and why this could be the siblings in the show all share the race so its not offputting ie if a girl is black her father will also be black and viceversa again no reason to rate it im not a fan of henry cavills acting these comments without constructive reasoning behind them just sounds like boomers with erectile dysfunction hating on random things for no particular reason henry cavill does an amazing job as geralt his form intimidating presence and the voice is just great i did have doubts i admit but damn hes is now my favorite actor and definitely the top of people id like to meet list other actors do an amazing job as well i literally couldnt identify a single actor who id say dropped the ball the main ones definitely didnt the character of the witcher is portrayed exactly as it should be if you dont like it then this is simply not your batch of cookies and you shouldnt try to persuade others into not watching it just because your superrefined tastes in cinema are rather singular too much exposition these ones are just pulled right out of their asses im sorry but ive watched this series with a person who has no idea about the books or games and its exactly the lack of exposition that is noticeable for new viewers i would suggest reading up on what the conjunction of spheres is as to understand the environment better because there simply isnt an explanation on this everything the characters discuss seem natural in their given context and i dont feel patronized when someone is explaining something in the show i would have liked to hear geralt explain certain small things about creatures like the necrophages dragons like they do about the striga camera angles are all over the place didnt notice anything like that sometimes they will tilt the camera angle a little or a lot but its done in a way that emphasizes the situation at hand so i felt it was a nice touch just another got series uh no this show tackles the subject of universal right and wrong order and chaos life and death the necessity and impact of making decisions the concept of destiny from the closeup view of its characters who are not kings or lords except for ciri maybe there is nothing of the sort in got that made me understand valuable life lessons just a bunch of rich high lords competing for a throne anything that couldnt amounted to a life lesson they killed off in seconds after building them up for years also these people are not playing war instead there are political events that influence them and they are forced to reactadapt to it they are not the ones pulling the strings much like most of the viewers
3,while this looks yummy its not the easiest by far this one is very easy and delicious c sugar c milk t vanilla extract c peanut butter bring sugar
3,great laptop on budget but lacks in battery backup
3,battery backup is not good the system got slow after days of use
3,perfect summer pants until i wanted to pet my dog and they ripped first time wearing them
3,rich brutal complex dark the series live in a muddy gloomy setting framed in mahogany and soaked in whiskey clouded by cigarette smoke and covered in blood each character is like an open nerve or a time bomb waiting to blow up right at the writers command the soundtrack is outrageously good and fits the s surprisingly well cillian murphy is brilliant in every way i think i might be in love now hoping for the season to be the most dramatic one
3,this seriesminiseries was incredibly well written acted and directed what more could you ask for elizabeth moss was incredible once again check out mad men if you havent seen her work before and i loved samira wiley orange is the new black its hard to describe without giving away the plot but it had me from the opening scene until the end it is depressing to say the least though there are admirable traits in the courage that is displayed in some of the characters i could go into the discouraging foreseeable reality due to our current political climate but that would be doing a disservice to the astounding work here the best thing i can say is to watch it looking forward to season
3,you can buy other laptop than zebronics just add more in your budget not good for gaming and high performance low performance low fps laptop
3,i like how this jacket is very versatile you can wear it to work or play it does have interesting detail on it i kept it based on the price and those details i have the olive color the arms are a little tight
3,frustrated that the details dont mention theres a side zip for whatever reason i have the hardest time fitting into dresses with side zips and so i was annoyed that the details say its a pullon style when thats not the case theres also no give in the waist besides the fit not working for me it was a pretty dress but overall a little too much going on
3,i was reluctant to watch this show because well zombies again its been done over and over i also didnt like bella ramsey at all im glad i gave it a chance the last of us is a show about human relationships and there are so many beautiful and touching moments i cared so much about the characters even those we only met for one episode bella ramsey is a great actress her portrayal of ellie and her relationship with joel is beautiful you watch it unfold and develop until its satisfying conclusion im very much looking forward to season started strong and ended with me wanting more
3,this guy its huge he is probably the next arnold alan has everything he is handsome funny buff and has charisma unlike stallone or rourke he has everything to be a daddy action hero and this show proofs that he sleep with a different girl every season he kills the bad guys he is everything we guys want to be he has the ladies and the brothers to help him in his missions and he delivers if he says that he is going to throw someone out of a plain he is definitely doing it he is a terminators and we need him i hope the next season its in my state the always great michigan i will wait for him
3,this top fit nicely and was tts but the pattern was different than i expected i thought it would be more of a desert scene and it turns out there are cowboys on it and it just didnt fit my style if there were cowgirls on it i would have kept it
3,i read the reviews before i bought this dress and had trouble believing that the dress literally fell apart at the seams so i bought it first the good i love the color the fabric and the design its very lightweight and loosefitting and is perfect for hot days the neck and sleeves are pretty on i can wear it as a cover up or put on a necklace and sandals for everyday errands and things now the bad it literally falls apart at the seams as you take it out of the package im surprised a
3,it is a beautiful coat runs small arms feel tight i am typically xs i cant even button it up bottom is skirted and falls beautifully it is light weight coat not really fit for cold weather
3,i read the book written by margaret atwood back in high school and it was such a lifechanging book when i saw that hulu was making a series on this i fangirled so hard this series so far has captured my attention and stunned me i am impressed with how close to the book it follows and i am excited to see how they present the symbolism that was written into the book into the series no spoilers but this is going to have you sitting at the edge of your seat waiting for the next twist and turn though i already knew the story i was still at the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next and i couldnt stop watching i binged the first episodes in the same day because i couldnt get enough breathtaking camera work and wonderful acting the role of a handmaid in the republic of gilead is extremely difficult and the actresses that play a handmaid all do very well impressive
3,a beautiful setting wonderful cinematography for the most part and an impressive ensemble cast try valiantly but ultimately fail to salvage this absolute stinker of a script the antihero archetype pervades modern cinema and television the last vestiges of the rounded heman protagonist having been thoroughly shunned at the turn of the st century in favour of your tony sopranos your jimmy mcnultys and your gregory houses the dissonance between the audiences belief in these characters fundamental goodness and the audiences exposure to things they do which seem to directly prove otherwise force the audience to reflect deeply on how they judge the people around them it bootstraps the audiences investment into the character causes some subconscious hope that they live up to the viewers internalized opinions to vindicate their belief in the character in order for this phenomenon to work however the antihero in question must give the audience a reason to believe theyre something other than what they outwardly seem costners john dutton whilst played with style and grace within the bounds of the script lacks this indescribable quality whatever it was that made us root for walter white when we could all see he was a selfabsorbed maniac is utterly missing here i cant put my finger on why he does the stiltedmasculinesingleparent thing relatably enough but this somehow isnt enough to make him remotely likeable it may have something to do with the fact this issue pervades the entire cast with each of the children ably personifying their respective personality disorders as is becoming tradition in shows depicting the inheritance of vast riches again though in succession one found oneself rooting for each kid at one stage or another here i simply hate them all a very very pretty soap opera but a soap opera nonetheless melodramatic grandiose entertaining to some degree but ultimately forgettable its like the video to a luke combs song but it goes on for several dozen hours
3,these sleep pants are very pretty soft and comfortable unfortunately after washing them once i noticed some small holes in the fabric which is very disappointing considering the price i dont mind paying a little more for clothing if i feel like the quality is there but in this case im not so sure i guess if you dont really sleep in them or wash them then they would probably be ok but then whats the point of buying them
3,i desperately wanted this to work its a beautiful color and overall qualityit is just so short and wide almost a perfect square if you lay it out flat i can see it looking better on someone on the shorter side but on my frame and long torso it just didnt look right few extra inches and this could have been awesome
3,i like the look of this tee and the fit is fine but its described as a cottonrayon jersey and in fact its polyester i would not have ordered if i had known and now have to take it back
3,really enjoyed the series i hope season is as good i think it really captured the reality of vacations vs what you imagine that will be like
3,nice soft jeans cute style and i wish i could keep themthey just are too small on me not sure if ive gained weight which i dont think i have because i had on a size pair of pants today but i ordered a size in these jeans and they zipped but just too snug around the waist i would honestly need a or looks like they are selling out quickly so i doubt ill be able to get the size i need if you have a small waist i think they would be fine but they dont fit my body type
3,best laptop for low price thank you flipkart
3,one of the few adaptions that are better than the original book it could get you emotionally attached with this dystopian world and give you a new perspective into the reality elizabeth deserves more than one emmys for her performance imagine acting under continuous closeup shots the only criticism i have with the show is some episodes can be too slow to be followed
3,love the design material and colorthe sizing as listed is waaaaay off running small returned to store after purchase online times to get one that fits which was at least generally easy o
3,ive not seen adams family before but that prerequisite is not required to watch this series it gave me a feeling of harry potters hogwarts starting episodes were good and sarcastic comedy was nice dialogues were well written and directed jenna completely justified the role and others contributed well the series is not quite addictive that you would like to complete in day till episode it was good and interesting later the series became a bit boring and story seems a little stretched i was expecting a better ending it could have completed in episodes and a better ending
3,doesnt meet the expectations battery backup not good i can feel slowness sound quality is bad and louder kindly go for a version which is far better than this and avoid intel processor i recommend ryzen equivalent
3,this recipe is ok but i have another similar recipe we like much better i think the hashed browns make this a little heavy
3,i tried on a l and found it incredibly unflattering on a large chest as the waist hits a bit high the color is vibranti wanted to like
3,kudos to jon favreau do what ever you want we believe you and take star wars to another level
3,ive played the game and im a big fan of it the game itself is a great story and was very excited for this they got a lot of the small details from the game in there right they did their own twist to the story but its done very well capturing the emotions super nice job gave the audience a good back story to everything and gave sarah a good story to add to her character gave you some good camera angles just like in the game like the casting too different and they did a good job overall well done if youve never played the game youre in for a good story because it looks like theyre going to do the story justice super excited for the next episodes very promising already
3,for some reason this card hates my galaxy s i was running around in circles for a week trying to figure out why my phone would get stuck at the samsung screen on reboots finally i decided to pull the card out and voila phone boots up fine again its now sitting in the ashtray in my car
3,i really dont know where the haters are coming from to compare this to any other zombie show is nuts there are none that is made like this so well done in all aspects of course being a fan of the game one has some expectations and im happy to say that the show delivers oh man how it delivers its terrifying action packed and emotional at the same time the source of the outbreak is innovative and scary and the casting is perfect pedro pascal and bella ramsey are so perfect for these parts and their way of interacting is just a joy to behold im really looking forward to the next episodes
3,the witcher is a captivating series which manages to draw you in and entertain despite a number of flaws that permeate its whole length set in a dark fantasy world of monsters magic and knigths this book adaptation follows the deeds of a renegade mutant bound by fate and destiny overall the production is great and definitely worth praising but still theres a lot of variation in quality and care in all the main aspects of story telling the story in itself though interesting enough struggles from pacing issues and sudden cuts and change of focus this is especially apparent in the first episodes where the viewer is continuously thrown in new situations without introduction or buildup be it the magical academy coming out of nowhere where a character goes from being a doormat to being the best in the span of two scenes or two friendenemies that after a thirty second dialogue are somewhat lovers the viewer seems to be fed facts more than stories theres a lack of progression coherence and immersion as a consequence many interactions between characters suffer of poor development and were forced to believe in romantic relationships friendships and whatever else we didnt see unfold the dialogues in turn for a significant part lower the quality grade of the show too many mediocre punch lines ridiculous conversations and generally a tendency to deliver sentences without weight this flattens the characters and binds them to their own little stereotype with no chance of redemption finally the show would have benefitted from some deeper worldbuilding characters places and events keep popping out of nowhere without introduction nor meaning its an issue somewhat related to the previous two and tends to lessen the viewer experience hopefully these issues will be fixed in future seasons as this series has the potential for being a longrunning success there are a lot of great moments and scenes and its definitely worth watching for fantasy lovers or those who already appreciate the story as told in other media just go in with the right expectations and you will be pleasantly surprised as in dont expect a masterpiece because even though its an above average series theres a lot to be fixed and desired
3,this top is beautiful in the model shot but average in person it ran really small i usually take a medium in retailer tops and ordered this in a medium it barely fit over my chest and was pretty short i am also the material is very thin not so much that you can see your undergarment but if you get cold everyone will know it also for the price i expected a sturdier fabric i would recommend holding out for sale if you are interested in this top
3,i was excited to nab this lovely because i am a sucker for a faux layered look i am usually an xs or s depending on the designer so i went with xs in this top based on reviews that it doesnt drape well i barely got my arms into the sleeves i thought maybe it was a mistake and i received a childs size i eventually did get it on but barely got it back off size up for comfort if you have to have this girl i was bummed my local retailer did not have a m for me to try returned for ref
3,i was so excited bout this top it looks adorable on the model but was not as flattering in person the white is see through so you will need a tank underneath which looks off with the mock neckline i bought the two other colors which are so pretty but the length of the top hit me at my hips it def does not have the length as described or measured in the description im and wear an xs and the size was right but length hit at my hips which is my widest part of my body if you have tiny h
3,writing review after month it was okay in all things not vry good but okay its value for money
3,i cant help but noticing tbsps of flour for the icing is this an erroralso baking cocoanot sure if i can get it here so can i substitute with the regular cocoa which we mix for tea apart from these enquiries im ok and dying to get started
3,theres some excellent action tension and drama here with very good direction no shaky cam or quick edits the acting can be wooden the dialogue is really cheesy at some points but its a fun time to just kick back and watch without too much thinking
3,awesome product though serious laptop users are going to be dissapointed mostly for online classes meeting or for very light work as it runs on chrome os most of the software that we are familiar with do not work on this chromebookand only android apps that can be stored are from google app store only outside that the the apps with apk are not supported
3,im a huge fan of the last of us video game the game had so many emotional moments between joel ellie it made us feel connected the audience were on a journey with joel ellie everything about the video game is masterpiece but the showwasnt a masterpiece it was average it tried to copy the game too much in the end it felt rushed i didnt feel connected to joel or ellie the jokes ellie made in the show felt rushed and didnt really hit me like the game does the wasnt enough chemistry between joel ellie dont misunderstand the actors were great but it felt like it was missing somethingmaybe a soul it was just bland and average i would recommend to people to play the game instead
3,i so wanted to like these pants i wear a lot of genie pants because theyre comfortable the problem with these is that theyre too narrow towards the ankle but the worst is the fabric its old lady fabric i was hoping for a pair of blousy joggers in a light denim and this fabric was disgraceful i knew the minute i saw them that they were going back ill keep looking and hoping
3,its good laptop for budget peoples dont go for buying by see the ms office it takes much time to load heavy sites and doing a project in powerpoint was too slow for this laptop if you want for internet surfing or watching movies learning you can buy this but this product not compatible for office job people
3,very heavy machine battery backup is very poor not good for daily usage
3,the people have spoken and as you can see from the mean score the show is great and well worth the netflix subscription i loved every second of it
3,i expected something better given the cost
3,battery life is poor sometimes slow and stutter
3,got this on sale in black and red and have only worn the black quality is poor seems to stretch out over the course of the day and loses its shape somewhat a smaller size may keep its shape better so you may want to size down not worth full price
3,for students purpose is ok not bad
3,i usually follow the boho look and this dress appealed to me immediately and it was in the color i wanted black so excited to receive this as i knew i could wear it both as a dress and a tunic but that was not to be the outfit consists of elements a tight fitting slip that fits awkwardly and does not give enough room in the bust nor waist areas and an overlay dress that is really quite pretty but it too was too tight across the bust area which made the entire upper torso ill fitting i n
3,the mayonnaise would get stars from me for taste but the container is style over substance the squeezy bottle is in itself a genius idea but thats where it stops it is too tall for the size of cap making it top heavy and unstable every bottle ive ever put in my fridge has tumbled out the cap is made of brittle plastic so it shatters as it hits the kitchen floor its like groundhog day each time it happens then as other reviewers have commented its impossible to get all the product out of the bottle surely this container is crying out for a design overhaul
3,this is a beautiful dress with unfortunate design flaws at the bodice of the dress the fit at hips and length is perfect falling just to my knee im lbs and grazing my hips in that regard the fit is spectacular but the bodice seems cut very oddly which would require tayloring to correct the armholes are large and flared at the bottom which leaves wings just under the arms that stick out since this dress has a side zip to correct that would seem a major undertaking the stra
3,as someone that played the game just wow finally an adaption that has been superbly done even if you havent played the games it is amazing the acting is stunning the way the storyline has been captured and articulated is just perfection i always loved the storyline in the games and it is a pretty incredible seeing it truly come to life the actors are perfect and they have done such an amazing job would highly recommend watching and cannot wait for the remaining episodes to air very happy about the one week at a time release otherwise i would be binge watching this in one week dont waste anymore time just start watching it
3,nyc product
3,good product under k
3,these run small i normally wear on ag stevies and paige jeans so i ordered these in and they were very tight otherwise very well made and super cute but i had to return them
3,i bought this shirt with the intentions of using it as a nursing top to that effect im happy with the purchase and will get a lot of use out of it i bought two on blush and one blue at the same time however i was surprised that the shirt was so open and loose i thought it was just a deep vneck but the design actually really opens up once the hook and eye is undone at the top you are then very exposed there is nothing but an opened front shirt this is convenient for a nursing mother
3,love the design and style of this dress when i saw it online however it falls a little short once in person it was a bit boxier than i wanted and the lines didnt make it appear as a swing dress highlighting your figure i wish this could have worked however it felt a little too unshapely
3,finally decided to join the yogawear craze and thought these tights and a few other pair from retailer would help me transition to this style my size l tights were just that tight so tight i really didnt want to pull them up past the knee i am not kidding i wear size pants and my legs are toned and shapely so there was no reason to expect a l wouldnt fit so sad
3,season one was great season two was good three was meh and four was pretty brutal beth was atrocious just became unbearable and totally unrealistic in season four huge reason why season four was so bad
3,i thought id like this dress in the neutral color i had to return it it as it was quite unflattering the skirt made my hips look big and the uneven shape didnt help the top fit well in my usual petite i think it would look nice on some people as its something different but i am not one of those it worked on
3,good laptop overall the battery isnt worth above stars average battery performance the performance however is top notch rtx does its job well display is good and when in hz mode its classic theres some issue with the keyboard lightingno idea if it happened just with me but some leds show rgb color when in static light mode rapid charging the gpu is good but it would be much better if they provided at least gb vram and a ddr ram now coming to the most important part i read more
3,i have a lovehate relationship with this dress the fabric and print are beautiful but like most swing styles this dress doesnt work if youre curvy tried on an xs in the store which was huge ordered an xxsp the length was perfect but the dress does nothing for a pearshape looks marginally better cinched in with the belt but i was lost in all the fabric and the skimming nature of the dress did nothing for me as my boyfriend said that looks like something youd wear if you were pregnan
3,the white lotus has the style of a wes anderson film every character is perfectly cast and executed especially the always impressive steve zahn and jennifer coolidge hawaii is also a main character and is accurately and hilariously presented
3,the writing and show is aimed at the uppermiddle class and its perfectly done you probably wont get the subtle psychological nuances if you dont care about human behavior at all social classes its a perfect piece of art if you live a slightly similar lifestyle narcissism addiction machiavellianism are rampant themes if you dont like human psychology watch your nascar race reality show or soap opera all actors do a great job not one is inauthentic i think the haters never lived on the us coasts or understood affluent culture you dont have to be wealthy and sophisticated to like his show as long as youre not fully ignorant of todays culture norms values and problems if you still want our society to wind back to the leave it to beaver days youll hate the reality of the show or just plain not get it this is better than game of thrones and breaking bad because its so societalcurrent
3,watched season ok nice setting and decent acting but nothing as amazing as some critics portrayed it definitely not a must watch severance shogun succession are a must watch not this season had more stars location amazing but very annoying stereotypes about italians and italy i thought that we were all past that stuff unnecessary vulgarity both explicit and hidden sad mediocre and depressing characters and situations shallow white folks in amazing vacation spots just whining messing around and using the people they interact with whether they are the friendsfamily they are travelling with or new encounters from different backgrounds and cultures dont need this kind of show to remind us about depressing human beings and exploitation cringe
3,i saw this top in the box and was excited to try it on the print is absolutely stunning and gorgeous i could not wait when i tried it on it is such a loose top and a tad short it was flowy all over i expected it to be loose from the picture but not like this it would work best on a very slender figure with white pants or leggings i dont recommend it for a curvy figure just not flattering makes everything look big what a waste because the print is so nice
3,performance is good but major con is not having backlight keyboardmixing other models reviews and photos in this product
3,this blouse is very pretty but it does gap at the top button darn such a hassle to have to return it or exchange it but i love it and otherwise it seems to fit
3,beautifully made gorgeous colors i wanted to love this but it just wasnt flattering too a shaped not enough drape to flatter
3,performance wise too good but no kaypad light power led on the edge hd resolution and carbon fibre design wld suggest to go with gb ram model which has fhd resolution with bigger screen and price difference of around to kltr on add gb ram for k
3,the thyme overpowered the taste of this pie otherwise it should have been fine a lot of steps to have the one seasoning throw it off
3,i wanted to love this dress but sadly i will be returning the color looked fairly different in person than on the model i thought it was a brownerneutral hue but the dress is almost like a yellow seersuckerish with brownish moth printing was cuter than expected the sweetheart neckline is darling but that is where it fit me poorly i have a c bust and the cups of the size were gaping on me in the front and all along the arm holes the straps were also way too long and falling off my
3,as a fan of the witcher universe im disappointed in the series lauren schmidt obviously believed herself to be a screenwriter and a novelist but the truth is that she blew the series too bad for the good books by andrzej sapkowski to have books for a basis and a wonderful sequel with the games and fail like that is a shame bravo to henry cavill freya allen and anya chalotra for trying to save the show but you cant fight the ineptitude of the writers and producers after the departure of henry cavill the series is utterly doomed i hope some other company screens the books in a decent way though i dont trust it to happen
3,i tried on this shirt in the small and the xxs both were ridiculously wide they were also both cut really short the peplum basically started right below my boobs though the small was maybe a little bit longer than the eex the stripes are really cute the cut is just very strange for reference the black and white is the small the taupe is the xxs
3,this is a very cute designed shirt but it fits very boxy and runs large
3,easy enough to make and very professional and glamorous looking a real showpiece i thought cake was a little dry frosting was good but ive made better with less expensive ingredients
3,i wanted to love this but if you carry your weight in your hips butt or thighs this is not the dress for you runs tts im lb and the small fit but made my lower half look even wider than what it it also felt like it was a bit too long in length
3,great recipe
3,love this product
3,i lived the front and back designs but didnt like the fit
3,this recipe was very delicious exceptthe jello ran down the sides of the filling and sogitized made soggy the pretzel crust i think next time ill skip the gelatin and use a cooked concoction of berries and cornstarch and yes the x dish is too large in my opinion
3,the trailer and the hype convinced us only to be disappoined within the st episode not reading the books or playing the game we entered with little knowledge and tried not to compare it to game of thrones the result is an astonishingly bad show maybe its because we dont know the story but the show itself feels incoherent and unhinged the time line is confusing but worst of all the dialogue is cringe worthy even decent actors struggle to make scenes look convincing and the only decent part are the scarce but well choreographed sword fights and henry cavill who is pretty charismatic we havent finished the show yet so who knows but we couldnt watch further after the episode that resembles beauty the beast without writing this review
3,this series is sometimes called star wars for adults it is the best and most mature star wars i know or even more generally it is simply a good strongly futuristic film even people who have never been interested in the star wars universe can simply watch it as a standalone series references to other parts are only for fans of course it is not perfect there will be more childish fragments and extremely convenient script simplifications but ok this is not isaac asimovs monumental work or carl sagans philosophical considerations but star wars for adults as for star wars it is very good
3,everything is mostly fine except the trackpad which as many had pointed is clicking from the back of the laptop this is mostly because of cheaper build quality and the use of plastic in back cover trust me you would not be able to use this laptop on uneven surfaces if you are okay with that you would really not have any other problems secondly the weight of this device is also too much compared to other inch laptops even though it doesnt have a very powerful processor h or p series read more
3,the pink version of this top finally arrived nearly months after ordering the expected delivery date kept slipping the color is not as shown online online it looks like a light pink the actual top was more of taupe color its a basic tee with pretty ruffling at the bottom not enough to keep
3,used on a galaxy note and so far it has been great fast card and excelent brand a performance update may it stopped working it does not work with my galaxy note or my pc sadly it is not recognized by any device
3,i purchased this top in white and lavender the white is very nice soft and semisheer but not completely seethru fine with a nude bra it is a swingy fit and slightly longer in back than front but i expected that i purchased a medium and its plenty roomy i am usually between a medium and large in retailer tops so i would consider it tts for a very relaxed fit the lavender fits slightly looser and the hem is really uneven it looks in some of the photos like this might be intentional b
3,the laptop is excellent in performance wise the only problem is the keyboard alphabetsnumberssigns are very hard to visualize as the printing is in a very dulllight color and the color of the laptops as well the keys are silver unless you are a typing expert it will be very hard for you to type apart from this the laptop is performing excellent so far
3,i liked it but my husband didnt so i am only giving it stars
3,thick material and cute design i am typically a size and the small in this fit but was snug in the crotch and just zipped at the waist there is not much if any stretch i am with a in waist so that was unexpected it does have cinchers at the waits but they are more for aesthetics than functionality it is a very cute design and the fabric is nice as well as the direction of the stripes
3,in my view bars are denser than cake i should have realized that with three eggs this recipe was going to be more cakey than barlike it tastes good but its not what i expected or wanted
3,i am lbs and ordered a m in this im usually between a s and m it was too big and didnt have any shape to it i dont think a s would fit much better also i ordered the pink but it was really a coral if my local store had a s i would probably try it on in a different color but they dont ill have to return this it looks so cute online
3,i bought this card to replace a lost gig in my phone htc g seems to be working perfectly so i will recommend to all wait read oni had this card in my phone for a little over a month when it messed up the phone stop recognizing the card tried it in the computer and it was not recognized either i contacted sandisk and they did send me out a replacement but i lost the few pictures i had on the original card i could have sent the card to sandisks data recovery people and they would have charged me if they were able to recover the data and nothing if they couldnt a bit to rich for me so i passed and unfortunately lost the photos
3,it is ok for the price but nothing special i would give it only out of stars because it needs some improvement but rest it is good
3,having never heard of the books or games before this show i wont comment on the plot or characters what i will say is why has hollywood still not learned to do scottish accents right he may have been a smaller part but the dwarf with the awful overdone fake scottish accent almost ruined the whole show for me as a scot myself i love when someone can do a good accent but too often its butchered and used as a gimmick which is infuriating hire an actual scottish actor they do exist
3,this dress is really attractive in terms of the pattern and the neckline but the dealbreaker for me was the lack of darts in the back hip areaso that the stretch fabric really hugs the full curve of your booty a size larger gave me bagginess in the top and a still snug fit in back that i just didnt feel comfortable about some darts could have made a nicer fit here but this is a a great dress if you dont mind a super body con fit
3,the shirt is mostly a thick sweatshirt material and is very short when trying on undershirt required to make up for length and the see through mesh in the pattern felt about size too small as well
3,im literally just watching this show because i want to see geralt and yennefer ending up together and i think henry cavill as geralt is a masterpiece other than that this show is a mess you dont understand anything if you dont play the game or read the books its so confusing for no reason
3,i bought this a little under a year ago to use with my laptop worked just as advertised for much of that time until it stopped letting me write or delete stuff from it could read just fine i couldnt even format it so it kinda just sat there for a while after trying to format it a number of different ways i finally contacted sandisk and they said they will send me a replacement free of charge i would have maybe given this a lower rating but the customer service from sandisk made up for the faulty card i am just glad it fell under a warranty period i think had the card not failed i would have given five stars if sandisk wouldnt replace it would have given one star hopefully the latter doesnt happen to you
3,i read all of the books and played all of the games as a devoted fan for more that years i cant deny that this series is some what exhilarating i dont agree with some of the choices regarding the cast but also i cant deny the truthfulness of the storyline most of my favourite stories were realized and my imagination was challenged i give it an only because of some bad acting apart from that i loved it ps hanry cavill is great in this way better than superman
3,i really wanted to love it but it was way too maternity on me i love flowy but the flow on this dress hit me in all the wrong places but i must say i have a ddd bust and wear a medium regularly well i sized down and ordered a small and it just didnt work it just flowed right off my chest to what looked like a dress concealing a baby bump overall its cute just not for me
3,loved reading the books and this series does right by them not an exact retelling but it captures the essence and manages to make it interesting well worth your time to watch
3,maybe its just me but this skirt had a little more volume than i was expecting im around lbs and the small fit me well i like that the waist is elastic in back providing some give but allowing the front to look smooth pockets are always great i got a striped henley from retailer which is awesome to tuck into it was excited for the s vibe the problem is that it fell an inch or two longer on me than the model and i already worry about midi skirts appearing frumpy without the
3,its a beautiful top but not for the price very thin material not seethrough though i fear it may easily rip
3,my previous laptop company acer and now i purchased again acer aspire laptop after days i realised screen performance lag available battery very poor build quality charging speed sound low sound i preferred asus laptop asus better than acer
3,a little bit of a disappointment for me because this show has a lot of great qualities there is some great writing and great themes the biggest theme seems to be how white people think they get it but they really dont and cant see passed the perspective their privilege alots them the humor is very refreshing its very satirical a little dark and springs up in moments you dont expect ultimately however the show is very meh not a lot truly happens most things you really see coming it does a good job building tension waiting for the big payoff but unfortunately that big payoff never comes which is why i think its an above average show at best
3,i really wanted to love this sadly the first thing i noticed was how tight it was in the arms and across the back size up maybe even two sizes secondly its see through a top like this looses its finesse to me once i can see my pant line and bra its very difficult to do the three buttons in the back yourself and finally good luck taking it off without getting make up all over the neckline someone dubbed it the poor mans pineapple top i couldnt agree more sigh i really did want
3,overall a good laptop is just one complaint against volume of speakers volume is very low
3,i like the tunic but there are no care instructions in the garment if i wash it once and it shrinks or the dye runs it will be going back please send care instructions
3,still dont feel is very fast or is just my phone i guess i will need to remove it and run some rw tests still its ok
3,as someone who has immersed myself in the witcher universe through the books and games i feel compelled to express my disappointment with netflixs adaptation of the series one of the main concerns i have is the divergence from the original books as a fan its disheartening to see certain elements and narratives altered without staying true to the source material the intricate storytelling and worldbuilding in the books were part of what made them so captivating and its unfortunate that these aspects were not effectively translated to the screen furthermore i found yennefers portrayal to be quite underwhelming in the books she is a strong and independent character but in the show she appears to constantly seek geralts attention which feels inconsistent and out of character this deviation from yennefers essence was disappointing to witness additionally the pacing of the series left much to be desired it often felt rushed and episodic akin to a soap opera where significant events unfolded at an implausible rate this approach undermined the tension and depth that could have been achieved with a more carefully crafted and deliberate storytelling style overall i cant help but feel a sense of sadness regarding the netflix adaptation of the witcher it missed the opportunity to honor the legacy of the books and provide an engaging and faithful portrayal of the beloved characters and their journeys
3,designs are nice and texture feels comfortable but sleeves are odd because they are angled i wonder what i should do to look cool in this tshirt i tried wearing neutral motif but i still felt odd also width is relatively wide so it runs large i rated average for overall rating because of these odd sleeves and feelings personally i do not recommend this tshirt but who knows it may be right for you so my advice is to try wearing it in a fitting room and check whether it loo
3,i loved both seasons one and two however while its still a good show im disappointed that it doesnt have the same vibe as it had previously my favorite character was killed off in season two and it was such a shame she brought so much to the show and allowed for wonderful characters to develop in and around her i really think mike west lost what makes this show great in season three theres just something lacking and i dont know if its the story or the characters i honestly couldnt care less about the suicidal father and his wife is absolutely horrendous i will finish the season but so far im not impressed
3,unfortunately this dress ran very large on me please no more vanity sizing and minimized what few curves i have my store didnt have this in petite so i tried a regular xs the neckline was low and there were at least inches of space at the waist it also flares out quite a bit you can see this in the catalog shot while this wasnt flattering on me it may work better on curvier figures
3,i bought the white tee while the print is nice the size is a bit too large with the xs looking relatively baggy i am around medium weight and very short
3,fantastic actors great music and vibe great writing the character arks and journeys are satisfying themes such as entitlement vanity hedonism first world problems only episodes another aspect that helped me enormously understand the show was the behind the scenes insights of each episode it helps one understand a ton more about the characters motivations and fears in a superb articulated manner cant stress that enough
3,screen is amazing light weight charges fast only con is battery life i really dont understand how that evo certification works when u use it like a human it lasts hrs max no were near evo
3,while i think these would be fun for kids as the meatballs do take on a fun spiky porcupine look as you cook them i only found them ok in taste i think next time i would still make the meatballs with the rice but try a different recipe for the sauce
3,what can i compare this show with got what else weve got nothing about magic and beast and in my opinion the witcher is better than game of thrones up to now and yes its not perfect because script writers could do a better job but they didnt because of their lack of talent and now i can only pray and hope for the nd decent enough season
3,i love this dress now that it is on sale sized down to sm petite added a simple full slip endless compliments and inquiries on where to buy it
3,i really love the look of this jumpsuit casual but classy shapely but comfortable im and similar to another reviewer proportional torso to leg ratio the legs were longer on me than the model in the picture but no problem there because theyre cuffedhowever the arm holes are too big my bra shows and the particular one i got came damaged with some of the embroidery coming unraveled on the back its also supposed to be dry cleaned and thats annoying for casual wear returning it
3,i am on the fence with this one it was alright nothing to write home about
3,i received this dress today for a june wedding i was so excited about it and the quality is beautiful but unfortunately i am going to have to return it it runs very big i normally like to wear items a bit biggerbaggier but with this dress it needs to be tight on the sides bummer
3,cute but too thick and rough
3,according to the sizing chart i should be an or i ordered a but i could not get the blouse zipped up around the ribcage the one spot i dont keep any fat i brought it to the store to exchange for a but i couldnt breath with the on for reference i am ddd it was the part that didnt fit the ddd would have fit fine i think
3,ordered this top online and wanted to love it but the fit was very off i love the drape in the front but it did not hit in the right place the fabric was soft but not as high end looking as i was expecting i love flannel tops and wanted a more formal look but sadly this is going back
3,im and and this made me look huge it was a small but too billowy it is pretty nice fabric and well made but i returned
3,i like the idea of the dress just not the fit in the bust im not particularly big c but it just didnt fit up there i wish the dress had built in support because you cant really wear a bra
3,this is a really cute shirt i love the design color and everything about this shirt but the size i am and lbs i can usually wear an xs or xsp the xs was huge and they were sold out of smaller sizes or i would have ordered one this unfortunately had to go back
3,the actress portraying wednesday is the saving grace production quality seems good enough with some good contrast between wednesday and other color palettes otherwise its a tween drama masquerading as an addams family story the story could have been better with a little less predictability and the unnecessary modernrevisionist pilgrim history that was shoehorned in it was a weird attempt to walk the narrow line of not offending most of the audience while still appeasing the selfrighteous hollywood powersthatbe the reviews comparing this to bad cw shows are spot on but i did want to at least finish the series the yo minds may be the targeted demographic if so this will probably succeed
3,like a previous reviewer mentioned the jeans do not necessarily look like the one in the photo i first ordered them in my regular size and also had to notice that they are cut like mens jeans with legs so skinny that i could only force them over my calves the embroiding is beautiful but it also stops the material from stretching so the the super skinny legs are a real problem also they are not as intensely stone washed as shown in the picture i decided to order them again one size bigger
3,i know rompers typically arenampt the easiest and while i loved this fabric this was a pain to put on no zipper etc and the buttons are tiny and since the fabric doesnt stretch it is difficult to even try on the length of the shorts was great and the fit was just ok all in all i donampt think it is worth the price
3,ive had my eye on this for a while went into my local retailer to try it on tried on s and xs it fit the same not much different the color is great will go with so many things however i have a larger bust ddd and am short wasted generally wearing petite in skirts because of it it sort of belled at the bottom peplumish which made it look like my bust drooped to my waste not flattering on me im ish and generally wear in tops it felt like it would stretch out as the day
3,love the design and the gold color but the seams between knit and lace were a little weird and bunchedwerent smooth maybe the one i tried on just needed to be ironed or something
3,i got the pink version it is a pretty color but the metallic border is painted not a metallic yarn the weave is wide and it looks like it would snag easy it looks cheap to menot what i expect from retailer am returning
3,gorgeous top but runs large especially in the arm holes
3,i so wanted to keep this sweater but the invisible metallic threads that give the sweater its crinkled appearance are super scratchy and irritating it definitely requires a long sleeved top to prevent the irritation as shown in the online photo it is lightweight and i planned to wear it over sleeveless summer topsdresses i have averaged size arms and there was plenty of upper arm room in fact extra room is designed into the sleeves one plus for those with upper arm fit concerns the lower
3,just finished watching the entire first season on netflix and here are some thoughts they managed to to partly recreate the lore of the books in got style though the video game did it so much better yennifer back story was invented from scratch which was good enough to explain her appearance at the point where she meets geralt for the first time but the execution could be much better the main antagonist of the books series appears only in the last episode or one before last and he does not fit the book description hes suppose to be much stronger episodes vary in their quality overall while for the first one i could give especially for that amazing sword fight the second one is dull and it was clearly less invested then the pilot at best cavill clearly went for a video game look and feel but unfortunately he overdoes it with the entire mysteryman of a few words type liked his f expression even though his physical build is nothing like described in the books he was a good choice for geralt and not a bad one for superman in other movies other castings arent as good especially disappointed from yennifer and triss castings ciri fits the profile due to another actreess playing her mother now there is a good fit magic animations are weak though the monsters are quite nice and fit the bill except the dragons who are underwhelming during the entire first season i enjoyed it but still there was a feeling that it was missing a few edging elements that might give it the wow factor for example the one before last episode in the first season of got or the entire witcher the wild hunt video game which was and still is an incredible masterpiece the pace was a off at times nilfgaard wardrobe is ridiculous conclusion the show isnt bad and in few episodes there were glimpses of that amazing world we all know and love but it needs improvement waiting for the second season and hoping they would improve the pacing and give the series more of the witcher look and feel
3,a show trying to be deep and failing utterly the script was weak the dialogue was terrible and it was definitely not witty like people have been saying quite the opposite in fact uninteresting characters for whom you feel no shred of emotion whatsoever never mind any empathy or sympathy i watched the whole season waiting to see the brilliant comedy and dry wit that everyone kept gushing about but i only disliked it more and more with every episode overall pointless boring and at times unnecessarily disgusting i genuinely have no idea what people found to like in this show if i could give it negative stars i would
3,just okay too much cheese and i even added plenty of extra broth
3,i ordered this online and was surprised to see yellow in the pattern when it arrived i cant see that in the online photo i didnt like the pattern at all when i saw it for real the shirt is very loose fits much like the model photo i ordered a small lbs just looks kind of frumpy and the pleat down the front makes the front hang heavily
3,i love maeve tops i love the material and feel of this brand when i saw the new tops that came out i ran to my local store to try one on im usually a large in a top once in a while an xl they only had a large to try so i tried it in the black motif i could barely get the top on it looked like i was missing of the top i doubled checked the size and it was a large its a shame the top is really cute if you are the least bit broad or busty go up a size or two if you are usually a
3,this tastes good but i greased the pan and the bread would not come out of pan so i lost the entire bottom of the bread
3,i loved season but the second season is not good it is poorly written the rest of reachers group are unpleasant crude and i couldnt care what happens to them i dont know why the current fashion is for people to be so obnoxious to each other in the first series we cared about all the key characters time for a new writer for season also theyve filmed it with some sort of blue filter which makes everything look bleak and depressing its also poorly lit and dark so you cant really see whats going on this is pointless and silly time for a new director cameraman and lighting team for series the series is missing the charm of reacher and risks becoming generic poor action stuff with a weak script
3,it started off really well but then with its cliché subplots and predictable progression it got boring and frustrating i have still scored it high in hope to see it getting better costner is great but would hate to see him die kelly is keeping it together cole hauser is doing a good job living the character the other characters are getting weaker banal predictable as we dive deeper into their sob stories the incidents and tragedies mostly backstories seems forced as if there is not much else the writers can think of and are executed with poor effort all in all a potential worth giving another chance
3,i just think this dress is so cute i love it with booties here are the fit details im and the front of the dress hits just above my knees i was concerned that it would be too short for my lifestyle based on the photo the sleeves roll up and have a tab to button however the button is very low therefore the sleeve rolls up not mid arm but actually about three inches above my wrist its still super cute just nowhere near my elbow just letting you know final detail that
3,this is an anthology style series where every season has a new story line with new characters season was great i enjoyed all of the characters and how they all intertwined there was some mystery in seeing where the story would go which kept me looking forward to the next episode i came up here to change my review on season because i sorta talked bad about it the first half of the season was kinda slow so i gave up on it but i did eventually go back to finish and it picked up on the later episodes last episode was a roller coaster i can definitely say that i am looking forward to season
3,stars for pedro pascals sexy voice this show is on the level of s saturday morning cartoons although the acting in lancelot link was far superior
3,my husband ate three bowlfuls amp indicated it was okay i substituted t potato starch for the flour used t better than boullion beef base amp shredded cheddar cheese with half and half amp milk
3,the dress is nice but i was not excited about the color the only color is this blue also everyone has their favorite fit i think i like some other fit better my biggest problems are color and that is made majorly from synthetic materials otherwise it fits well and for the right body type it will be perfect fit i like to own dresses made of more natural materials
3,my dad would watch the original addams family when i was a kid i do remember the unique mannerisms of each character and the cooky spooky lifestyle they lived i remember liking munsters more but both were enjoyable enough however i was basically the prime demographic for the films and like many others yeah i loved them never saw the cgi one i went into wednesday knowing pretty much nothing about it except it was a spinoff based on wednesday and christina ricci was somewhere in it indeed i was quite pleasantly surprised honestly i enjoyed it quite a bit i only have a few complaints and most fall under the same umbrellabut they had a very high standard to live up toand id say they did as good a job as anyone probably could have one thing i recall about the previous addams family iterations is they didnt necessarily relish in the fact they were so weird they justwere it was sort of their thing how they were basically oblivious to how twisted and odd they were and it was everyone else who commented on it wednesday doesnt really follow this which i do find disappointingto an extent in its defense from what weve seen it does seem to be mostly wednesday who almost takes pride in her oddities and the rest of the family is as above of course we see barely anything of the family so well just have to see where they go with it however if you are going to make this change i think ortega and the writers did as good a job as you can its not like she made a huge deal out of her weirdness but it was still a shift away from the traditional wednesday the other major complaint is similar to others here at its core wednesday really is a teen drama a la degrassi definitely not as cheesy and teenie as degrassi the show absolutely is made to appeal to adults as well but its a similar structure where most of the episodes in some way revolve around teenage drama at schoolnamely boys and popularity contests proving yourself etc fortunately there was still enough adult content that i could just roll my eyes and laugh to quickly get over some of the cheese but it seems more like a show made for a motherdaughter than a general fan of addams burton or all things creepy having said that i enjoyed it immensely i loved the dry humor and wit ortega delivered so perfectly she is obviously the real star of the show im a pretty armisen fan but i dont see how anyone couldnt like his fester is it christopher lloyd no but so what he still did a great job showing the demented quirkiness of uncle fester just because its different or not as good doesnt mean it isnt good lloyds version was actually much more of a shift away from og uncle fester so if you dont like armisen you cant claim that as being a reason same applies with the family members i think the s films pretty much perfectly cast the addams family so netflix had a high bar to beat there and instead of also going for the perfect look they decided to roll the dice and go with the new look for the most part it works it will be divisive but i think over time we will continue to appreciate this addams family more and more i admit i dont love czjs morticia but i dont hate her either im probably in the minority of that one though so take it or leave it they are also clearly trying to capitalize on the ever widening gap of harry potter content so nevermore and wednesdays paranormal adventures are very reminiscent of the harry potter moviesif you liked those you will almost certainly like wednesday just imagine hogwarts but slightly smaller and if tim burton designed it and they frequently visit hogsmeade and on the note of harry potter there is also a magicparanormal aspect to wednesday which at first i was a little iffy on but i learned to appreciate what they were going forwhich is exactly what they said a unique spin off with the wednesday character not a recreation of wednesdays past my advice dont look too far into it take wednesday for what it isa portrayal of everyones favorite sociopathic antihero prodigyand you are bound to enjoy it really hope to see more of armisen and ortega in a season
3,very poor speaker screen is excellent and sois performance
3,really great storyline acting cinematography for seasons and but they should have finished it on the last scene of season
3,cant pants the material is lightweight and perfect for summer however i felt they were cut narrow in the hips i am a solid size and i couldnt get the over my hips
3,hanging just with browsing even i did not play any game battery just ok camera extreme poor even my years old acer laptop camera times better than this laptopsound is average sometimes bad sound from speaker i restarted display is goodi highly disappointed bcos i bought this laptop for just good browsing and normal games even it does not fulfill it i really disappointed main issue its hangs a lot its irritating invest some extra money and go for other brands final score read more
3,i fell in love with this dress when the catalog came in the mail and jumped online immediately to order it the dress just arrived and is not as pictured in the catalog the picture of the model walking on the beach in that picture it appears to have black lining or a black slip underneath when in reality there is nude lining sewn into every edge and isnt going anywhere for a minute i thought about having it removed by a tailor but it seems the entire dress would have to be resewn some of
3,loved this top but had to return it the collar is gorgeous but terrible quality
3,i connected it to my galaxy s but every now and then once or twice a week it will eject from my phone and the phone will need to re read the card its not a big issue but when it happens you may need to wait like min for your filesit happens a lot less now that i dont use the powersaving funtion something about the powersaving on the phone seems to not deliver enough power to the card
3,cute skort but seems to run big its also sort of long for shorts the model must have much longer legs than me i may try a size smaller since i love the print but im not optimistic
3,this star wars spin off series is set shortly after the events shown in return of the jedi the empire has fallen and the new republic has been established there are still independent planets where most of the action will take place and remnants of the empire the story is centred on din djarin a bounty hunter known as the mandalorian or mando one day he is tasked retrieving an individual that turns out to be a baby of the same species as yoda he succeeds in this but then feels guilty and rescues the child and flees he is now hunted by the bounty hunters guild for breaking their code even worse surviving elements of the empire want the child back the unlikely pair will get involved in a variety of adventures some lasting just an episode some lasting a season and others continuing through the series i really enjoyed this series and i expect most star wars fans will too i liked how it is mostly centred on characters that didnt appear in the films there are some enjoyable appearances from old favourites but for the most part these are fairly minor mando and the child are great central characters and they are supported by an impressive range of secondary characters some of these appear regularly others just for an episode or two the series captures the feel of the films with impressive backdrops on a variety of planets the cast is impressive especially pedro pascal who does a great job as mando even though we rarely see his face as his creed demands he doesnt remove his helmet in the presence of others overall id definitely recommend this to fans of star wars im looking forward to the next season if you have yet to watch this make sure you watch the book of boba fett or at least episodes between the second and third season as it shows important details of the mandalorians story line
3,i am a huge fan of the games recently started reading the books if you have no idea of the witcher you can still enjoy this show but if you are a witcher fan you should have a blast watching it completely the entire season and rewatching it again it came out yesterday my only complaint is the clothing wish they had done a better job with geralt witcher gear the nilfguard uniform also could use some upgrading the acting was amazing the storytelling was superb the world of the witcher is just as deadly and dangerous as it should be
3,this laptop only normal used not for gaming coding
3,how can anyone that have read lee child novells about jach reacher see the midget tom cruise in that role problably because cruise paid a lot to mr child for the rights why dont rick moranis play the hulk next time finally here he comes stepping right out of the novells reacher personified alan ritchson the story follow the novells storyline good performance from all actors we dont miss any details that always happens when you try to make a movie from a novell we all look forward to meet reacher in sesson
3,i liked the overall recipe i used bagged precut coleslaw mix and the cabbage seamed to really break down next time i would buy a head of cabbage and slice it i also used chicken instead of pork i would also make additional sauce the next time i make it
3,my wife made this last night she did substitute the white kidney beans for the great northern beans the flavor is excellent for the family and i was able to kick it up a notch with some habanero powder at the table i found the chili to be a little thin for my liking and it would benefit greatly from a rest period to get some more of the flavor into the beans
3,this sweater is really cute great fit and unique style unfortunately the ivory color was more yellow than i like not the right shade for my skin tone
3,build quality poor
3,i love this sweater so why a lower rating while i love the material and the color it lost all of its shape before i even left the house i am a size small and it looked clownish on me before i ever got to my dinner party i plan to wash it this evening and i really hope that this brings it back to its original shape and keeps it
3,this top is beautiful but beware there is a lot of extra material on the sides it was not flattering on only because of all the excess fabric clearly the model in the picture has it pinned behind her it would be a keeper if it was cut closer to the body but sadly its going back
3,i wanted to love this sweater but the fit is off slightly i ordered my regular size xs and the chestshoulder area fits nice but the waist comes very tight and not flattering to wear unless style similar to the model with a tucked in look nice color and decent quality fabric but not my favorite fit going back to the store
3,was drawn to this dress in the store my location had it displayed well one mannequin with the dress a jean jacketanother with the faux fur cardigan the dress is a very vibrant red but the fit is not for me i am busty c with a short torso and the dress made me look like dolly pardon on top but there was a lot of room on the bottom i tried on a size and felt like i needed a size larger on the top and a size smaller on the bottom having said that the material is a very good qu
3,this is a cute dress not real form fitting and made of a thin but comfortable jersey material little see thru and kind of sexy though if you have cute lingerie
3,this top runs large i am going to return the medium i ordered for a small i wish it came in different colors i love the style
3,battery is not all all for this laptop co shud think about the battery life
3,just average product not expect so much
3,children of men and half life had a baby but in inhumane way
3,i saw this in that postcard catalog and it drew my attention immediately so when i saw it at the store i knew i would try it on this dress is gorgeous the lace is sturdy and wont easily be caught on things the chambray is substantial but light its put together well and the slip covers greatly the material isnt stretchy but it keeps it shape and i like that im and it hit me right at the knee so its a good length if you wanted to wear it with a cardigan to work as a spring
3,i chose this dress to try to flatter an hourglass figure but was disappointed the fabric is a beautiful soft fine silk but unforgiving the cut is not truly a wrap and with a fixed thin elastic waistband was too short waisted for me while the model looks elongated the thin line under my bust created two poofy sections not flattering at all while i was drawn to the shape for my body type it may be better suited to another happy hunting
3,laptop is good but charger quilaty is very poor k is best laptop
3,id been wanting the blouse for quite a while but hesitated based on reading reviews when it went on sale i thought id try but it was like a tent on me the fabric was pretty but just hung without any resemblance to photo too bad because the color was gorgeous could have been a favorite of looked like photo
3,battery life is very poor other than is overall good
3,for bushbabe i have several recipes that call for brewed coffee and all i use is instant just make it like you would for a cup of coffee and add it into the recipe any recipe that calls for espresso powder i also use the granulated instant but i crush it to make it a powder then i measure
3,this is a beautiful fabric and the skirt is so nice what is wrong is the cut of the skirt one side bells out more than the other giving it an off center look from the front my legs were not centered
3,i bought the pink one i like this salmon pink color not too girly type of pink the material is super soft and light i have skinny torso so it looks really nice on me not showing thin body the only thing that disappointed me was it shrunk after the first wash it shrunk one size when i bought it size s it covered my flat hips fits just like the picture but now my hips are showing i recommend getting a size up if you are too lazy to wash cold air dry
3,i purchased this dress for the second time it is the gingham garden dress from that was blue and white same dress new name and color generally this dress is large overall and long i wish i could have purchased the petite size i liked it enough to have it in black and white this time around i ordered one size down and fit is much better recommendation order size down from your normal sizing as dress runs large the quality of the knit material is soft and flowing
3,loved the books lived the games relived geralts life in this series brilliant
3,i tried this dress on in the store prepared to buy this lovely piece i feel that it should have been a few inches longer it would look more proportionate next the tie is really difficult to place but it creates some great detail to the front and back it wrinkles easily i can see it would need to be ironed before each wear lastly it is not lined what a bummer at least the skirt could be lined but it does have pockets that is sweet
3,when i first inserted the card in my computer it wouldnt recognize it had to jiggle it around in the card reader and then it took a long time for my computer to finally recognize something was there when i tried to read andor format the card it kept telling me there is no disc installed in removable drive e i wasted a lot of time trying to find a causefix before i tried a different sd adapter as soon as i changed adapters the card worked perfectly
3,somebody really put a great deal of thought and effort into this one contrasted to other recent star wars offerings andor is more of a slow burn dialoguedriven drama it slowly builds its narrative gradually increasing the suspense at every turn the empire is becoming a more aggressive and present danger with every hand cleverly played the stakes continue to mount its a very suspenseful spy story and political drama very reminiscent of british high drama i think they did an amazing job of building the most immersive star wars offering to date the set design is phenomenal and extremely believable even the costumes are more serious and subdued given that its star wars there are few nonhumanoid races and no silly characters including their droid which manages to avoid being too extreme this wont likely appeal to many children if it suffers from anything its that it can be a bit light on gratuitous action and humor although the dialogue doesnt feel too heavy it avoids being dull and is easy enough to follow without being guided by the hand there is minimal explaining and so they obviously meant to trust peoples intelligence to some degree i for one appreciate this level of respect i love the way it slowly increases the stakes builds the suspense and gradually leads to more tense situations although i felt it could use a few more exciting moments to break things up however they obviously spent a lot of their budget on costumes and set design perhaps they merely ran out of money the acting is top notch some of the best every character feels alive and convincing every personality is plausible and suits their role there is so little to complain about even the soundtrack is great one of my favorite aspects is how they show the truth of revolution how its not all a bunch of war heroics and freedom fighting its about all those unsung every day sacrifices how it requires great risk and endless patience the show does an excellent job of showing that neither side is fully good or evil and that both have their zealots and betrayers i like how it avoids automatically taking sides in childish fashion it shows how theres an empire merely doing what it must to survive believing strongly in the ideals of order and a rebellion full of zealots who are willing to risk everything fighting for a cause which will cost them every benefit of their own success however there was a brief dialogue about why empires are ultimately wrong fragile and must resort to extreme measures to sustain themselves which really sums it all up it helps to understand what the rebellion is fighting against and why they are so willing to sacrifice everything while knowing fully well what it will cost i found this to be rather exceptional and refreshing to see i also appreciate that they avoid using nudity or sex to sell things theres plenty of alternative reason to want to see this show especially if one cares about the shows political ideals and wants to understand why the two sides fight they do provide us with a great deal of eye candy in the way of a goodlooking cast incredible set and costume design and high tech wizardry everything from beautiful nature to dystopian urban environments abound i only wish they could include more of a harshness of outer space element although this whole series is intentionally a more downtoearth experience hopefully this wont be the last time theyll make a star wars for an intelligent adult audience this is a must watch for anyone who fails to take star wars seriously there are serious topics being conveyed all the time but theres unfortunately too often distraction from it this show is a reminder that its not all jar jars and cpos or westernstyle shootouts
3,its a fun watch but the teenagers are annoying as hell vacation would be better if the brats were left at home except maybe their boy
3,what can i say seasons were excellent solid writing with enough following to the source material really good cast and acting topped with some decent special effects and set design resulted in a very enjoyable dark fantasy adventure then along came season oh dear oh dear oh dear oh dear it feels as if theyre trying to achieve the same as the first two seasons but with half the budget and deplorable writing every scene feels cheapened and like a soap opera what on earth happened no wonder henry cavill left this is nowhere near the caliber if the first two seasons and an epic disappointment the forth season will undoubtedly be doomed to failuref this is anything to go by seasons season
3,its value for money for basic work like working on office or browsing battery backup is decent display is awesome only problem is heating gets too hot underneath while continuous working for an hour but it doesnt affect the performance of laptop overall decent laptop
3,im obsessed with this skirt and was so excited when it came in the mail i ordered a m and it was massive im and typically wear a or an as i dont really have much of a waistam built more like a column i wanted it to sit right at my waistright under my ribs wanted to wear a crop top with it but it fell down to my hips which made me look significantly larger the quality is amazing and the skirt is even better looking in person worth ordering in a size down and getting it tail
3,soup tasted great but it tasted nothing like a cheeseburger more like a cheesey potato soup with hamburger added
3,leaving after episode boring and goes nowhere trite alleged rich people spoiled kids with drugs mean people so whats new nothing and badly done
3,i made this recipe because of all of the great reviews im not sure if i would make it again because i felt it was just ok
3,product is good will review after few months usage
3,i had tried this on in the beige loved it but could not find it in my size so i got it in the pink did not look at good as the beige
3,kevin costners love for western movies is next level yellowstone is not like those bornig flat westerns it has great and strong stornyline and the intense acting with great caste its so well directed that you cant look away from screen for a minute it will take you a journey for live of old natural western civilization and culture those amazing cowboys moments aahh so fascinating i just love the sceneries the horses the wranglers and also a great bunch of cowboys so go gor it its a great adventure its by all means writing acting direction
3,nice condition
3,this shirt fit really really big i ordered an xl but think i could get away with a l if not a medium sadly its going back otherwise its high quality and a beautiful design
3,peaky blinders is just amazing there really isnt much to say about it you just have to watch it by order of the peaky blinders
3,i recommend with reservations these leggings are wool soft not itchy light weight lovely knitted pattern they run large i sized down to a small the first time i wore them they were fine but the second time the waist stretched out and was useless they were falling down as i walked such a shame because everything else about them is perfect for cold winter days they even fit under my silk skirt and would make other lighter garments wearable in winter so what to do at the price th
3,thank you
3,i use simple between other brands as my skin breaks out easily and gets very dry with some branded soapsshower gels i like simple as this does not happensimple refreshing shower gel does exactly as it says gives you that clean feeling without irritation literally has no smell this review was collected as part of a promotion
3,i tend to size up when ordering tops online as i find a lot of retailer stuff to be inconsistent a little big is better than something way to small well that was a mistake with this top i sized up and it was much too large everywhere more so than i thought it would be but the neck theres no button or hook and i could barely get the top over my head if i had gotten a size smaller i wonder if it would have ripped as i pulled it on cute top material is soso
3,i struggled at first wasnt sure what i was watching with episode and to an extent then it started to all come together feels like a lived experience disappointment struggle and the irony of life great performances and some exceptional work from the main cast at first murray bartlett was frustrating me with his delivery then things turned and he stood out in and give it a go it was very entertaining
3,i do think this blazer is comfortable and looks decently cute but wasnt sure about the fabric hte coloring is fun too i decided to pass on it only because of the previous review regarding shedding
3,picked this up in the store today but didnt try it on first it is even more gorgeous in person than the photo but sadly this did not work for me when i got it home to try on there is wonderful detailing but somehow the bulky knit fit was just not flattering on i think it is the thick knit and slightly shorter length the knit was bulking up in all the wrong places and visually added about l bs to my frame such a shamereally wanted to keep this beautiful sweater but it just did not l
3,i am normally a size in dresses and bought this in a small so if you are a smaller person this would likely be a bit loose on you the color was odd i liked the navy blue but the pink was a pepto bismol colored pink i just felt like i would get sick of the colorpattern after one wear the fit is cute and comfy
3,maybe i wouldve kept this top i love the print colors and design however i feel like i had too much of a bosom to wear it since my bust and torso seemed too large for it the peplum ruffle bottom lining and top straps did not look good
3,the witcher is not a bad show far from it although my rating of may imply that my main problem is that i was not drawn to it after episodes which to me is a just a nogo in a tv series there is plenty to like not enough praise can be given to henry cavils protrayal of geralt the fight scenes are shot beautifully and the bard character is a welcome comic relief a la tyrion however every episode i felt i was watching fillers just episodes within the same universe yes but with scarce links or progression in the main story arch clearly this is because of the confusing timelines which is fine in itself but not at the expense of viewer engagement the story arch that did advance more i found not gripping at all i have never read the books or played the game so ultimately i think this show cannot be rated very highly because it is a challenging one to fall for if you dont have enough background material on this world these characters
3,so i havent actually tried this and im sorry for the misleading star rating i just wanted to get someones attention on the length the photos show the dress draping with almost a train even with the model in platform heels but in the video the dress is about inches off the floor is it the model in the video that is extra tall someone help me out this looks gorgeous but since its an online exclusive i wont be able to try it on at the store
3,cavill was great as geralt but the show itself is bizarrely disjointed and really poorly executed
3,i wanted this dress in wine for a holiday party but it just has no life whatsoever unlike prior reviewer i found nothing to dislike about the fabric the fabric is fine and the fit is fine im sometimes an and sometimes a took this in an and definitely would not size down its relatively close and wellfitting but the sleeves and neckline further ruined it for me the sleeves are shapeless long and baggy the neckline is just blah it needs to be neater trimmer more cut the ruc
3,each episode is a cinematic masterpiece what a time to be a star wars fan jon favreau helped marvel revive with iron man and now he is helping the star wars franchise too now i am eagerly waiting for kevin feige to take the mantle and deliver us some masterpieces in the near future disney is already changing the definition of tvseries with its big budget shows lining up
3,may be it is value for many product normally we can use for office work as like type of excel project etcit does not sustain for major loading work like editing havy gamesmajor issue is when you suffering on browser then overheating problem occurs at normal room temperature but when you using in cooling area or in room temperature it is fully away somenow we are facing issue in my product is white line highlighted side on display cover and about warranty guaranty when was product is deliv read more
3,i really wanted to like this shirt but it made me look months pregnant which would be fine if i were pregnant it sits wired in the bust and flows out in the front and back not flattering at all
3,my family says they did not enjoy this recipe but i thought it was mighty tasty my husband and two boys only ate a couple spoonfuls but i finished two bowls without a problem
3,battery back is very low even normal use battery drains in hours
3,i followed the recipe exactly as written mine turned out very moist and would not hold together not sure what i did wrong the taste is good i made sure the toothpick came out clean my husband thinks it did not bake long enough i was wondering if i cut the strawberries too small and had too many the frosting was fine using almost cups of sugar
3,cute otter i found the breathing sounds a bit too loud so i turned them off otherwise a nice music box
3,i wanted to love this shirt and thought i would based on the reviews it runs really large however and while i love how flows it is i also looked pregnant i am keeping though looks nice layered under a jacket or sweater but alone i feel it looked sloppy and big which is sometimes just what you want so it is staying in my closet
3,this is a nice dress made with high quality fabric unfortunately ill need to make a return as it was quite big i bought this dress in an xs and it was too large all around i am about and lbs and would have taken the petite but there were none available im not sure the petite would have even been small enough the dress was a bit too long for short ladies and definitely too large in the waist and the bust im small on top its too bad a this was a cute and versatile dress that
3,im pretty tan and i always have to be careful with white tops or pants i love the embroidery detail but this top is practically seethrough for me it is doublelined but i could still see my bra very pretty though and i was disappointed that it didnt work for me
3,first of all i will say the acting and cinematography is great the problem for most will be its really hard to follow what happens when the show cuts back and forth between scenes happening years apart i honestly only understood what happened because i read the books also there is way too much character development between the episodes an example is the thing yennefer wants and what drives her in the middle episodes that is a defeining characteristic of her in the books but here its just suddenly she wants that a lot of it feels tacked on because that how it is in the books but we need to use more time developing the characters in the show i think most of it is based on the shows first season is based on short stories hopefully it will aline more in upcoming seasons where it will be based on traditional novels
3,i am still in the process of making this so my star rating is not really fair however i am confused i went out yesterday and carefully selected all of the ingredients if you look at the ingredients list there is no mention of provolone then when you get to step you are supposed to layer with provolone provolone is similar to mozzarella but the instructions call for provolone and mozzarella note the recipe also calls for c of parmesan cheese no where in the instructions is that ingredient mentioned finally the sauce is to be simmered for one hour unless you want it burned dont plan on that it is very thick and i had to stop with nine minutes to go obviously this recipe was not kitchentested
3,this shirt runs extremely large looks boxy and unflattering
3,this knit shirt is too thin as most knit shirts i find are i got this in the white and was excited to try it on due to the fitted cut and cap sleeves the upper part was great but the waist was too large for me and was actually too long had to return especially for the cost i purchased the xxs which normally fits me
3,sandisk makes a lot of claims about this card and some of them are questionable i own two and while the highcapacitylowprice certainly makes them useful theyre not the answer to all of my recording needs first of all do not use this with a gopro hero or later model despite sandisks claims these cards cannot handle the demands of true hd recording gopro removed it from their list of recommended cards because it caused the cameras to lock up and turn off even with mycanon vixia hf flash memory high definition camcordertechnology which is over years oldthe sandisk ultra card does not meet the requirements for shooting in fxp mode x mbps even though the camera says only a class is required a firmware update to the gopro fixed the issue for hero and hero cameras but it did so by throttling the recording speed for the cards ie lowering the quality of the recording slightlythose shortcomings aside the sandisk ultra can shoot in xp mode x on the vixia hf and it works with all of the settings of acontourroam waterproof hd p is it waterproof temperature proof xray proof shock proof i cant say the contourroam is a waterproof camera so even nonwaterproof cards are safe for submersion if theyre in the housing the ultra has functioned in weather and after being dropped so theres validity to the claim of it being temperature and shockproof i guess ill find out whether its xrayproof the next time i go through the airport
3,andor is the star wars show i have been waiting for lots of grey and interesting characters spies space fbi politics family problems money robberies and even implied brothels and sex this is a fantastic show that doesnt need jedi and lightsabers to work perfectly even some baddies are interesting and you can feel and root for them if you choose too not at all comparable to the laughing stock empire we saw in the last star wars cinema movie after boba fett i was a bit disappointed in disney but this is great in my opinion andor is the best star wars show made so far perhaps even the best star wars since return of the jedi
3,engine of the otter way too loud
3,battery backup very low only to hours display qulity not good fan sound very high over heat issue
3,i ordered an xl because most retailer button ups i need a and sometime due to my shoulders and chest but this was huge
3,i was excited to order this sweater when it arrived the green didnt stand out as much as the picture here it also felt too itchy i usually wear either very soft wool or wool with cashmere because i cant stand plain thick heavy wool this one was just too itchy for me it is going back
3,i dont have the right body to pull this off too many awkward styling issues length slits tie stitch quality so this will have to go back maybe if i was taller and slimmer this would be good alas it isnt meant to be
3,even without a lightsaber in sight so far this show contains such principal essence of star wars that it is instantly recognizable yet it is such a breath of fresh air some will call it slow but i call it purposeful and confident just as my love for the cheesy dialogue and camp of the prequels does not detract from my love of the meaningful themes and mythological status of the original trilogy my enjoyment of the adventure and action in previous shows and films does not detract from my fierce adoration for andors complex questions and statements about morality we contain multitudes and so does star wars im thrilled that we have another season of this treasure coming and i sincerely hope lfl and disney see the value in giving star wars more of the mature treatment this show received
3,technically this is mostly wellmade acting is great cinematography is great music is well done good sound editing unfortunately the script this being tv is required to drag this relatively short book into infantum with nothing to add but boredom i watched the film first and i found that to be ridiculous but entertaining it took a satirical tone and seemed to understand just how stupid the handmaids tale actually is this is a truly dumb story on so many levels the characters are not very compelling and the movie does us a favor by only being minutes this series just drags on and on i was bored the exact story told in the movie in minutes is dragged into many episodes here with absolutely no humor just drag colors and a constant depressing tone that never lets up fine for a movie but for season series not so much i can tolerate feminist works when they are actually entertaining such as the original the stepford wives all the men are evil there but again it has humor and knows it is ridiculous i even didnt mind the obviously feminist invisle man also with moss this series is bogged down by a dull and drawn out story that is so depressing and dull by the first episodes i dont know how anyone can like this how are feminist still pretending they are oppressed in western society is beyond me unless we are talking about the erasure of biological women by trans women seriously this series is nothing but massive gaslighting and does nothing to help women in fact series such as this hurt women by making them into negative whiny brats and all the men into controlling patriarchal caricatures with no depth total waste of time and money what a crock of crap watch the minute movie instead youll get the gist
3,alan ritchson plays this analytical straighttalking kickbutt giant of a character perfectly i can watch him all day with his unconventional way of interacting with people i also loved the hardcore actionfight scenes that you dont often see in a tv series but i could have done without the overly convoluted plot that creates unnecessary confusion and has more than a few holes i am hoping the second season will do better on this front
3,excellent movie plenty of action and suspense a must see cant wait for season i could never picture tom cruise playing reacher if you dont watch it youre missing out
3,i ordered this quite nice cardigan i received the sweater promptly yay fast shipping but never received the belt to it i tried emailing about it but didnt get a response the sweater really is the softest thing ever but it will not close without the belt and trying to use a different belt just doesnt work i hope to receive the belt soon because id really like to wear this a lot this winter
3,if someone is having fun they will be punished because all of these characters derive enjoyment from drugs alcohol scandalous relations manipulating others then theyre going to be punished its the same thing as euphoria and its a sin though it is a very funny show and there is heaps of character development i felt very depressed watching it at times if i had to breakdown the scores i would say character in way every character is an archetype waiting to be deconstructed their problems are all apparent from the first episode vanity unhappy marriage privilege depression most of their problems stem from unhappiness and insecurities i both loved and hated them acting jennifer coolige is a living legend alexandra daddario shined i loved the actors they really sold every character directing amazing tension at the most seemingly normal conversations the camera was still during the conversation scenes which was more complicated than simply shot reverse shot i liked how the shot would get shakey whenever something was very clearly wrong to add dismay story every episode is about hours of the guests week long stat at the white lotus the pacing is great here nothing felt dragged out or too short i wish they gave us more information on hawaiin history there are a few characters who are hawaii locals and one somewhat discusses colonialism however he references history and uses words that flew over my head i wondered if it was satire but i think it was an oversight this made the hawaiian backdrop stereotypical as if the writers criticizing white privilege forgot to consult locals and just read hawaiis wikipedia page the culmination of each characters arc was deserved it left off on an open ending i look forward to the continuation this is a comedy drama miniseries with a touch of mystery in the first episode it is hinted one of the characters died inevitably it is revealed and it had me guessing until the end the comedy was intentionally cringeworthy and it worked the critiques of white privilege colonialism and especially pretentious zoomers pretending to be holier than thou while benefitting from middle class america that hit me pretty hard i think if you come away from this unchallenged you have missed the point it doesnt give you a solution to privilege it just recognizes its there and reminds you to respect the things you have because someone was exploited so you could have it sometimes it had me yelling at the screen laughing out loud or burying my hands in my palms overall
3,i was looking forward to receiving this dress i am tired of all of the swing dresses most of which are not flattering on my petite frame i am also uncomfortable with dresses that fall much above the knee as i am somewhat older the colors and fabric of this dress are beautiful vibrant but not too bright when i got it on i was thrilled with the fit until i looked at the back there are pleats at the waist in back and there is way too much fabric it looked like i had a bustle under the d
3,i read prior reviews and decided to go forward with my purchase i am so pleased that i did the m fit nicely the fabric is not as soft as i had wished however i think with wear it will become broken in
3,ive been working my way though the addams family before i knew wednesday was getting a show and i must say im utterly disappointed in wednesday luis guzmán made a completely unbelievable gomez there was no relation between the real gomez and this mess there is absolutely zero chemistry between gomez and morticia which was their major defining characteristic how do you remove a major component of something and expect it to work its like taking wheels off a car and expecting it to still drive i believe catherine zetajones could have been a great morticia but just like guzman it didnt feel like there was any relation between the real morticia and this version when she kissed gomez it looked like she was thinking im not getting paid enough for this crap pugsley is a sniveling little wus i can only assume they made him that way to try and boost wednesdays girl power image whatever the reason its pretty sad wednesday herself seems to track reasonably well with how an angry angsty teenage girl acts though being played by a year old is stretching it about the only original characters not a major disappointment are lurch and thing the secondary characters are shallow and predictable stereotypes im not sure if they wrote them with the intention of making them as annoying as possible or it just came organically but they could have done much better i made it through episodes before i couldnt take anymore theres no hook to the show they try to position several mysteries but none are compelling just a yawn fest overall the show is just trading on the addams family name with no real connection to the original
3,ignore those reviews that relate this show to dallas if you really watched dallas this has nothing to do with it so please watch dallas and this show before you start relating the this show is remarkably acted genuinely produced and directed and was written out of sheer heart for the west and what it brings yes theres murder hell if there wasnt people would even be whining about that on here watch the show kevin costner cole hauser luke grimes kelly reilly wes bentley make an awesome team all they are tttying to do is keep their heritage together dallas family just trying to fight each other for it how is that related watch the show
3,this soup was just average to me i think that if you like a stuffed pepper soup this is great but i tend to like a more creamy soup i probably wont make this again
3,this dress was ok i thought the fabric was soft but not my favorite its a pull on dress that would be easy to dress up or down but i have bigger hips and this dress was really not flattering on my would be better on a different body type
3,the fact that its filmed outside on location is like a film it scenery acting and writing are superb best show i watch this summer and its on cable
3,this limited series explores the lives of several people who are staying at a hawaiian resort we know from the beginning that a death occurs during this supposed dream vacation the question is who and why i was interested in every character in this the honeymooning couple who are already starting to realize they may be mismatched the family trying to reconnect despite very different personalities and obstacles the eccentric older woman looking for connection they all rang true to me murray bartlett playing the resort manager is definitely a standout hes that guy who does and says all the right things but youre never quite sure of the sincerity hes like a high end resort version of a very good used car salesman after seeing the first episode i cant wait to see the next one
3,i really wanted this top to work but i felt that it was big and boxy its shorter in the front and longer in the back the seam and peplum hit at a strange place and made me look disheveled its definitely worth trying on but didnt fit me
3,great item ordered for my wife for christmas received it and the medium petite waist size measured at approximately so it is at least off the standardand a thick material needs a bit more room to fit well disappointed replaced with next size upwell see
3,as wednesday addams begins at her new school nevermore she finds herself attempting to thwart a series of monstrous killings all while attempting to navigate her new relationships at school when i heard that tim burton would be directing and producing an addams family spinoff starring the phenomenal jenna ortega as wednesday addams i nearly fell out of my chair it immediately became one of my most anticipated shows of the year and after finishing it did not disappoint jenna ortega has possibly the most potential amongst the younger actors and actresses working today and to see her in what looks like the role she was born to play is truly incredible every scene she is in is phenomenal and her ability to take over a scene with showing basically no emotion and focusing on acting with her eyes and body is phenomenal burton is known for his dark gothic style of directing and it shows in this first season every scene involving wednesday is given a feel unlike the rest even if they are in a place such as a coffee shop or a classroom if wednesday is present burton adds a gothic style that is perfectly well done the plot itself is a well written mystery it keeps you guessing throughout the season as clues are discovered and killings continue my only real issue with the script is the the writing for some of the side characters i found that anyone under the age of who is not named wednesday were not super well done when the story shifted towards a character for the purpose of a subplot rather than using them within the solving of the mystery i found that i was less interested that being said if they were used in the context of the mystery i didnt mind their character and thought it worked well enid on the other hand is an exception to that i thought she really worked as a counterpart to wednesday and i felt her subplot was well handled it was characters like bianca tyler and xavier that i felt could have been handled better the older side characters on the other hand i really enjoyed gwendoline christie as larissa weems is amazing there is one scene in particular where her and wednesday are in her office and she gets a little agitated and leans towards wednesday it gave me goosebumps the final thing i will touch on is the use of the entire addams family i wont go into into spoilers so ill make the blanket statement of i liked the castings and i liked how they were used overall wednesday is everything i wanted it to be a great showcase of tim burtons style using a childhood classic piece of fiction all while jenna ortega gives what may be her best performance to date in a well written murder mystery a
3,this review will be short after i have seen a lot of reviews that give ratings at the extremes or i can say that neither of them are real the show has a lot of strong points and you can see where the budget was spent at the same time whenever you will see a tv series made from a very popular bookgame there will always be a problem regarding accuracy the reality is that if you find out how much was the budget for this show compared to others you will be dissapointed with what you will see i know that this sounds strange but if you see this show without knowing their budget or their cast you will be pleasantly impressed but after you find out that this show cost more than got but lacks the story you will be dissapointed i didn read the books but i have played the games and they were awesome sorry if i have offended anyone but if the show was named the white wizzard and the budget was half i would have said that it was the best show ever sorry for the english its not my native language
3,design performance battery display touchpad not working smoothly
3,unfortunately as with got the creator took many liberties in terms of casting and story i honestly find it weird how many of the characters were cast to be nonwhite while the game had all of them to be basically of european slavic or so descent geralt and ciri were great i would say obviously triss is just horrible but for me yennefer was totally out of place it just did not come through which pretty much broke some of her scenes obviously in the end the writing hurts the show much more with a generally rushed pace and not enough time to develop oneoff characters and interactions perhaps each episode should have went with a certain character exploring the situation more overall while the witcher season one is definitely worth a watch it fails to reach the level of the games
3,i was really dubious at first after his portrayal of superman and his pretty boy persona as to whether this could ever work however he is geralt every gaze expression and movement is geralt he has studied this character in great detail and plays him perfectly really loved the first season acting was brilliant fight scenes were epic binged watched the lot cannot wait for season in my humble opinion this could be a contender for the got throne in future
3,season and are great easily an and out of season starts slowly and stays slow and tedious throughout the characters are weak compared to previous seasons everything was just subpar in comparison there was a nice twist in the last episode but it wasnt enough to save the season from being an absolute stinker most episodes in this season were bewilderingly boring and uneventful i remember noticing i had watched episodes and thinking the season is half way through and nothing has happened im sure there will be a season but i wouldnt hold out much hope for entertainment based on season season season season
3,peaky blinder is amazing it has a story a plot and several incredible characters cillian murphy gives a show the series gives a show
3,i loved the look of the dress its a very flattering design however i absolutely hate the side zipper every time i have worn it the zipper will get stuck and it is a struggle to get it up the side tie is a very cute touch but you definitely have to figure out the best way to tie it so you dont have a huge bump of fabric on your back having said all this i still did get a lot of compliments from this dress i do wish the dress had a lining
3,absolutely love these pants i have had these pilcos for about two months now and it has been a staple in my fall wardrobe i have worn them at least once a week the only downfall is the button has already fallen off and the seam in the knee has recently torn apart given the leather im not sure if they can be fixed these are fabulous but the quality is just not there very disappointing
3,very nice soft and excellent workmanshippeccato for the mechanism with the battery compartment that is disproportionately too large and makes the back of the plush hard and overall the object too heavy
3,l space is frustrating i wear a top but with ds i tried a large in this bikini top because from past experience with l space they run small theres just zero support the tie design helps secure the girls in place but also flattens them out if you tie it tight enough so you dont spill out
3,started watching just for trail but ended up watching till the latest episode loved it the story is amazing from the beginning this hardly has any form of rest bang on from the start
3,im so torn with this toy i want to love it but im not sure if i do hence giving it a midrange rating its super cute but not overly cuddly for a bedtime toy due to the power pack inside the breathing function is really cute but the mechanism that pushes the tummy in and out is noisy and my daughter months old learnt very quickly that she could force it downwards so ive had to turn it off the buttons being on the inside means that its difficult to adjust any of the settings while youre laying there with a baby possibly probably laying on one arm while you try to get them to sleep it has a super stiffscratchy fisher price label sticking out of the side which couldve been made from silky material as this is a comfort toy and the last negative its really overpriced for what it is it should be at most positives as said its really cute you can wash it the lullabies breathing and heartbeat noises are all soothing and lovely and my daughter does really like it which was the aim of buying it so i guess its doing its job
3,roach best actor no doubt masterpiece as a witcher fan i was worried they would mess up but ohh boy im the happiest man alive rn cant wait for s i might need a potion to wait that long
3,every thing is good but my screen is beating up
3,jenna ortega is a star depthful acting for a challengingly one dimensional role the supporting cast is excellent i was truly surprised to be charmed by the whole thing jenna also manages to be quite alluring as wednesday i dont know if this is a second season show or where it will go if it does but it is a truly satisfying series in one season we have done the family so i suppose it being netflix a second season is inevitable i had seen and not really noticed jenna in the scream rebootomage she was good and cute and strong but i didnt really see her until wednesday i think charles addams would approve
3,we couldnt wait for season loved season one and reacher now it is a team reacher is diluted and much time is spent around forced comradery repetitious slogans and dont you get lonely all of the books except this one feature reacher as a solo operator partnering up with random folks or the equally cool and aloof neagley but for the action pieces few and far between folks sitting around chatting it feels like an after school special season was a home run season naptime reacher was reacher now its something else a good thing ruined ill still watch but do other things during the boring parts i can only hope for more action and more focus on reacher
3,i dont get too worked up about memory cards usually try to buy at least class i am sure this is a fine card just the one i purchased was defective replaced it with another brand not wanting to try twice
3,i know i know the music is supposed to be unsettling but thats not my issue my issue was how damn loud it was compared to the dialogue i had to keep turning it up and down i could barely hear the dialogue over the music the intensity of it didnt bother me just the sheer volume now apart from that i thought it was a good show super cringe great acting great cast and surprisingly funny jennifer coolidge made me feel sooo uncomfortable and i love her
3,i was looking for a shirt of this style i thought it was very cute but it is not red as advertised it is really a brick orangey color which is definitely not what i wanted very disappointed sent it right back
3,this romper is cute i wont deny that however the rayon fabric made me really feel like i was wearing pajamas i was afraid it would wrinkle horribly however the real problem with this romper is how hard it is to get on and off your shoulders im short but have a little wider shoulders so perhaps that was the issue it seems like another reviewer had the same problem there are only two snaps from the waist up and nothing to open it further from the waist down so i had to do some cont
3,material and color is nice the leg opening is very large i am and the length hits me right above my ankle with a leg opening the size of my waist and hem line above my ankle and front pleats to make me fluffy i think you can imagine that it is not a flattering look if you are at least average height or taller this may look good on you
3,this is a bizarre bit of teen rubbish that is actually a fun romp you just have to ignore the bad acting from many of the younger actors the main characters do manage to pull off their characters well but many always sound as if they are just reading their lines punctuation marks included teen high school series are hot right now with every country in the world producing their own versions this one goes a step further and adds the supernatural twist but in a fun way its all a bit silly but does keep you engaged despite the level of silliness being off the scale theres not much to the story as the idea seems to be to move from one crisis to the next complete with all the special effects available
3,struggled through the final episode of this season last night and it was a struggle first we decided a drinking game was needed to keep watching a drink every time duffy said theresa but that could lead to fatal alcohol poisoning so we had to abandon that then came the revulsion at duffy and reacher having sex with absolutely no sexual tension between the characters leading up to it weird weird im not the biggest lee child fan but the story was incredibly antiseptic and boring this series is sliding downhill again not a lee child fan but i hope the book was better than the series if theres a season of terminal list i have to hope amazon doesnt mess this up too they wont better source material off to watch the final season of bosch lets hope amazon didnt completely mess this up too
3,my daughter doesnt even marry him i thought id help her sleep but she doesnt like it
3,finally i was so looking forward to this and i was not disappointed great adaptation and wonderful music the flashbacks and modernization of the story line were skillful and true to the characters please keep it going for more seasons
3,the dough was very dry and i had a hard time keeping it together on the cookie sheet they were falling apart i used old fashioned oats i dont know if that made a difference but i have made other oatmeal cookies with those oats and they were great will not make this recipe again
3,the casting for his is so strange czj is as gorgeous as ever but fails to evoke the right morticia vibes without the quirky mannerisms and innocently selfrighteous tone this morticia is all dry and no quirk lets forget about gomez going from half latino to full he now has a newyorican accent has gained lbs and lost all of his weird humor wednesday is doing what she can with this roledoing a good job with the deadpan humorlessness wednesday is defined by but again there is no underlying quirky juice to make her at all funny she does things that are funny from time to time but the jokes fall flat because her character delivers with a kind of anger that goes a little too deep i think if youre not familiar with the original show or the sonnenfeld film you probably wont mind all this but for me its just not my cup of poison
3,normal
3,i loved this dress and was hoping to keep it but for an align dress it was not roomy enough in the hips and the waist was baggy i think this dress would look great on a very very slim build with straight hips
3,in case of wednesday series i would say that the way of introducing the characters was new and the way that story was going until the two last episodeswas nice but i think the writers had no clue what they going to do for ending the session they were very good at the beginning but they screwed the the last pages of the script in my point of view i see a lot of opportunities in this series personally i expect better session in case if you wanna to be away from your life or you wanna have an epic time with your family or friends i recommend you to watch this it is good series i hope it was help full
3,this made a really high cake it was over inches when done and it was nice and moist but lacked chocolate flavour i would probably not waste such expensive ingredients again i have a sour cream chocolate cake which is better and less expensive
3,product is good but delivery partner was very rude
3,season the music was so distracting i watched a lot using captions sound off it was like funeral music this season would have had more appeal without it season is set in hawaii so the set is beautiful the story line weaves through all episodes ending with the th one season is set in sicily with better music same format episodes more beautiful locations both are entertaining dramedies each character has their own quirks and dysfunction and their interactions with each other throughout the seasons are what the series is about i think of it as a episode murder mystery season also has unappealing music in the finale too distracting and takes away from enjoying the show best quote daphne to harper you dont have to know everything about someone to love them
3,good and easy to make
3,this is a lightweight knit dress that is welldesigned but very formfitting i decided to return it because at almost there are parts of my body that i dont need to show but if youre in great shape or willing to wear shape wear this would be super cute
3,i was worried that netflix had jumped the shark releasing a high fantasy flagship so soon after gots end especially such a bad bomb ending leaving fans ready to destroy the next victim but the witcher has surpassed all expectations this is big budget fantasy with all the stops pulled out theyve created a work with a fresh tone and perspective something got had run out of halfway thru its run can not wait to see where else this series goes
3,prime video has a hit or miss track record with their original series they either mail it or drag you into a hour slow fest of usual mundane series whats odd about reacher is it starts out pretty good then just the plot line just doesnt excite only gave it because the lead actor held it together but this isnt that good also how f n hard is it to make episodes in a series when did become the normal lazy a hollywood
3,this is honestly one of the best shows ive watched and that says a lot normally i dont like watching tv but ive been trying to get myself invested in something this show has done that for me its cinematic shots incredible character development and perfect suspense is enough for me to love it this is one of the few shows that actually feels like you are there with the characters everything aside i love the spinoffs from the game they feel so necessary and they honestly make the show feel even better than i was hoping for every episode seems to get better and better i hope that with the second season that there will be some necessary plot changes as well
3,truth to be told it was amusing intertaming but it could be way better they could use lots of the adams stories if the show wasnt named wednesday from the adams family it could get or higher from me but the way i see it the wasted characters potential storylines i enjoyed the first five episodes therefore it contains the dark in the meanwhile romance story and the director mixed them so smothly wich you can get ingaged with the story and characters one special vision to this show is that how the director writer made a character out of a hand and a hand only a cut off hand who does not speck yet you can hear his voice at the end i recommend you to watch this show if youre attracted to fantasy mysteries stories
3,based on the photos i thought this dress would be very flattering on an hourglass shape i ordered the faded reddish pink color the color was true to the photo and very pretty and soft the dress has an open neckline fitted waist and skirt length that are all flattering but the fabric is thin and clingy making the dress overall not flattering on anyone not as thin as the model it certainly doesnt hang i believe it runs true to size im generally a xss and i ordered a s and the fit was
3,i was disappointed that this dress had no pockets as every picture on this website suggests otherwise it is a great color and shape still sad though
3,ill be the first to admit that i have a sweet tooth ive never met a candy i havent liked but this meal was too sweet if the brown sugar was omitted that would cut back on the sweetness id definitely make it again without the brown sugar
3,while i wanted to love this dress i did not like the scratchy lining i also did not like that the scratchy lining was considerably smaller than the overall swing of the dress so it clung to my curves uncomfortably i wish this had been done in silk would have been a much nicer material i returned it
3,had to take a needle and pull threads to the back so not visible and i see this as an ongoing problem
3,cute pattern but the shirt is very thin and runs small and short
3,amazing story and cenarios the actors are stunning
3,ok good performed
3,the major flaws regarding this laptop screen quality is just ok webcam quality is horrible only usb ports
3,am i the only one who thinks that season was a lot better than season i dont know why but season couldnt catch me maybe its because ive read the books
3,this is a gorgeous dress i got the red version its stunningthe zipper is trash however im scared of getting stuck in it like another reviewer
3,i ordered this skirt and i was so excited when i first saw it the photo doesnt really do the colors justice the contrast of the bright colors makes this skirt one of a kind i returned this item however because when i tried it on the pattern was just at the wrong place and emphasized the thighs for any of us pearshaped ladies the side profile of my thighs in this skirt was just horrible
3,i wanted to love this dress i preordered it and waiting weeks for it arrive when it arrived the dress was much more pleated than i thought im not sure if i misunderstood the images but i did not know the dress was going to being pleated all over i just thought that the fabric had a texture the print is adorable but the shape of the dress was not flattering on me i am pretty straight down with somewhat wide hips but the fabric of the dress made me look larger than i am i think this w
3,i got it yesterday but the sound quality is very very bad and its not clear at all its not audible at all and there is a heating issue also but the sound of this new laptop is really very disappointing worst sound system display is average not good
3,i made this yesterday and it came out fine it was tasty and spicy but i like deddmen cant get over it not being like jambalaya since the rice is not cooked in the sauce which is very soupy more like gumbo but without the roux which i know is what makes it gumbo next time i will cook the rice with the sauce not separately
3,sound quality is worth of money
3,i love j brand however the fit of these jeans was all wrong for me they were perfect from the knee up however they stuck out too much at the bottom a slight taper from the knee down would have made them perfect i had to return them
3,very very sweet even with cutting the sugars in half
3,i started to have trouble with my card after about months i shall attempt to get a replacement and hopefully the new one lasts much longer
3,i found it fun to watch at first bristling with energy and intensely alive however something was always missing for me its almost too much almost grand guignol love the cowboy stuff the horse stuff the scenes with cowboys especially the job interview scene between rip and walker love the scene where walker gives beth some tips on how to handle a horse however where are the good people the ones you admire and root for not many here finally last sunday i watched episodes and got kinda burned out i dont buy the way the ranch is run you can never leave what is this hotel california not believable and the owners son has to fight big tough cowboy rip to manage the wranglers say what what planet is this on i am tired of the dysfunctional family its exhausting to watch too much control too little humanity if this is a cautionary tale there is too much caution for me
3,this sweater is thicker and darker than it appears online i thought it would be more of a blush color but its more dark gray and brown it wasnt that flattering on me as a cardigan looked a little cuter all buttoned up but ultimately i am not keeping because of the color
3,this may be better with a few changes little bland and too much lemon
3,definitely add some thyme to the onion mushroom while sauteing stir in a bit of sherry and then the flour before the broth no flour needed if blending all in a food processor no salt if using salted butter and salted chicken broth
3,unfortunately the otter doesnt work right from the start we slurped it in and after minutes at the latest it is out without any touch the lifting and senk movement when it works short is extremely loud cant imagine that it should be that wayunfortunately im very disappointed because we were so happy to have found something for our little one at last and then it just doesnt work rightin itself it would be a super great gift or a great companion for the little ones in the evening but just for that it would have to work
3,i ordered this pants in white and black i read the reviews and werent that bad i am and lbs i got them in size small they are way too big the small size seems to be xl and they are way too long for someone who is maybe or i have to returned them quality is ok looking on my opinion
3,my family did not particularly care for the consistency of these enchiladas we found the chicken mixture rather soupy and actually used a slotted spoon to dip the mixture onto the tortillas the flavors are good but we will most likely not make this recipe again
3,i love the lacey design of this top however it is very wide and doesnt fit well on someone with a small frame i tried ordering a petit size the width was better but this size was too short in addition the lace didnt lay very flat and there were lose threads all over overall not worth the price
3,hey i am happy to buy this laptop i love it in all features in this laptop i realised big problem in this laptop is battery backup most of the time battery reduced as soon as depende upon uses normally battery backup to hours only
3,everything is good but not better but camera mic low quality and speaker also when in the room silence not sound speaker volume cant listen to much low sound but you can listen sound when u lift the laptop and near arount your ears speaker to much bad really to much bad
3,i wanted very much to like this soup but it is just too bland for my taste even with adding more cheese and hot sauce it is bland i think it definitely needs onion along with the carrots and celery
3,this sweater in the neutral beige coloration was exactly what i wanted to rotate through my winter leggingboot rotation with different vests belts and scarvesspot on it is not heavy weight soft perfect length for a tunic on a frame c lbnow the weird part sleeves were excessively long and seem to have stretched longer after wear anyway hand wash and little to no pilling a plus i literally roll up the sleeves to wear this tunic and it tends to be bothersome hence t
3,so disappointed that no where in the limiting did it mention this suit is australian in size i ordered the im usually an but that was sold out and the suit arrives and doesnt even fir over my hips the label clearly says australian us gutted that i have to return this suit because of this sizing issue the suit looks to be well made and the design is adorable of it only for
3,this dress is very pretty but only the bottom is lined the top is completely see through and you would need to wear a tank or slip underneath i wanted a dress i could just throw on and not have to layer so it didmt work for me but if you dont mind layering or your bra peeking through its still a very beautiful dress im usually a petite in most things but this wasnt available in p so i ordered an xs the length was good not too long not too short but it was cut way too low for me on
3,im a tunic lover so ill usually take a chance on them im and usu a size or medium i ordered a small instead of a usual medium since other reviewers said it runs small this hits about mid thigh which is a good tunic length but the overall fit is oversized its more like a swimsuit cover up rather than a nice blouse thats really the best way to sum it up oversized swimsuit coverup like top im going to exchange it for an xs but i think even thats too large
3,this dress has been one that i just adored online and in the store so i was happy when i bought it on sale i have worn this dress one time thinking that i would love it the problem is that as i wore it the dress continued to stretch out of shape and just did nothing for my curvy bottom half the dress just looked pulled and stretched out of shape i would say that it may be the yarn and that it has too much give or at least more give than i want
3,its like the addams family harry potter and a series of unfortunate events had a child this is better than i expected to me christina ricci will always be wednesday but wow jenna ortega really brings it its witty and fun and is a fun watch im super excited to see where this show goes jenna ortega as wednesday adams is truly fun she nails the cold dark vibe to wednesday the no smile the dark eyes and the iconic pigtails the way she delivers her lines is a great start to this show her wardrobe is fun even if its just a uniform and we cant forget about thing truly a good time
3,this is a beautiful dress all thats missing is a bonnet
3,i love the cut and aesthetic of this shirt but the fabric unfortunately shows even the slightest hint of sweat which makes it difficult to wear without being self conscious
3,i ordered this shirt in the purple stripe and was happy when it arrived and i really liked the color and style however like the other reviewer when i tried it on the little circles on the front line up perfectly with your bra straps i even tried a different style bra and had the same result sadly i returned it yesterday
3,this show was great had all of the dark and morbid humor of the original addams family shows and movies this show was equally enjoyable for my teenaged daughter my year old mom and me the casting was done very well with one exception really my only criticism of the movie was that luis guzman was an unfortunate choice to play gomez not smooth and suave enough to play the part he made gomez kind of bumbling and was hard to watch next to catherine zeta jones who was perfect in the role of morticia interesting storyline plot twists funny and engaging i binged the whole show in a few nights
3,the caramel frosting is absolutely outstanding the cupcakes themselves however were just okay and really tasted more like a muffin than a cupcake i have a chocolate cake with caramel frosting recipe that is really good and id make that in cupcake liners before id ever make this again
3,this coat is absolutely beautiful an instant stunner the style is very classy and timeless it is definitely more of a lightweight coat than true cold weather wear yes it does run large but that is the cozy look of it it is not meant to be formfitting my one gripe is that especially at the price point if its not going to be especially warm it should at least be otherwise functional the coat i received has pockets cut on the outside but they are sewn shut a coat without pockets
3,the first season of reacher was solida classic lonesome hero story where nothing can stand in his way staying true to the books unlike tom cruises portrayal which leaned more toward a sherlock holmes vibe this reacher is a bulldozer plowing through everything in his path however the second season is a total snooze fest teaming him up with his old buddies dilutes the charm of his oneman army persona and the addition of a love story feels forced it took me at least four attempts to get through it disappointing compared to the strong start of the first season im indifferent about the third season if i cant find anything else to do i might give it a chance but im not exactly eager to dive in after the letdown of the second season itll be more of a why not decision than genuine excitement
3,just watched season this series succeeds on so many levels its scary my only beef is having to wait for season outstanding
3,seriously after watching episodes i was hooked disclaimer this is not a murder mystery type show this is not a show about characters getting to a resort and discovering some dark secret it is very much a show that is character focused and relies solely on that go in expecting to see rich people living their lives at the white lotus and learning the characters and amazing actors who play them you just cant say enough good things about the actors the humor is brilliantly dark and funny almost constantly and the drama and heart can be felt very strong at certain moments im not sure how i feel about the ending but i do know this this is an hbo classic its a live or hate show and its one of a kind im not sure which genre i can even put it in i highly recommend just sitting down with an open mind and if the characters interest you just go for it
3,the laptop is very heating and charge was drained very fast
3,it stores data and does a good job at it what else can you say about something that has become so common place in todays world
3,gorgeous but the trim detail on both instore coats was already trashed and falling apart for and it cant even make it out of the store intact i love the look but didnt want it to fall apart they shouldve done an extra reinforcing stitch on the trim such a shame
3,after months of using system not working well sometimes some keys are not works properly and the worst part is you cant find solutions for the problem against keyboard software corrupt
3,i wanted to love this but its too much maintenance to utilize definitely something parents can wait to buy when the baby is months or older i wish i didnt have to open the back of the sloth every time i want to utilize everything the sloth does i would also like it to be more stuffedsquishy to hold it fall short on the cuddling factor the box inside in huge and obviously hard the sound and vibration has good payoff but user friendly its not unless youre content just pushing the tummy to do thing versus going to the back and opening it up over and over to utilize everything it can do btw the back opening is made of velcro i think its over priced for the payoff factor of enjoyment that is lacking with this toy to sooth a baby or toddler
3,everything will be alright but display not good
3,good but better
3,battery performance is low hrs after full charging otherwise overall nice laptop
3,cute dress to throw on and go fits pretty true to size except for the slip underneath its a little tight and i felt to short for the dress i ended up wearing a full slip i had under it and that work great
3,positive side display is no doubt full hd it is perfect for basic usages using ms office no hiting problem found weight is so light to carry anywhere backlit keyboard is provided ram can be extended upto gb negative side battery backup is below average exhausted within minutes after hours of full charge as mentioned in the user manual performance is not as expected its slow enough it becomes trouble as to sometimes it starts lagging when i read more
3,it isnt as fast as the class i used before and the file structure only allows g free to put data on i can see some loss but im very displeased with losing over g of space thats a big waste percentage
3,this dress is so cute and so flattering i loved the shape but i wore it wonce and the fabric was pulling on everything just holding a purse while walking managed to pull out a ton of the fabric when you spend so much money on something you think the quality would be better
3,the series in a whole perfectly describes the dilemmas and process of a rebellion not too soapy and not too dry it gives a coherent and complex view of the issues faced by the rebellion the pace is also good not too slow in a way it reconciles with george lucas original idea and that of the trilogies of opposing the force in power that being dictatorial and the parallells to todays society are ripe genevieve oreilly is absolutely exceptional both how shes written and the actress herself she is the perfect example of someone balancing on the edge please give us more characters like this
3,nice but students only
3,laptop is ok but it is heating up after hour of usage and battery life is upto hours only display is good charging needs to be improved because it is not a fast charging device
3,its just ok very thin and feel like it might say and stretch color is very nice but much thinner and sheer we than what i wanted
3,we bought the otter around the black friday our daughter then got it at christmas and a month later it was unfortunately defective we got a new one very quickly however for stars however in my opinion you have to change the batteries very often which is why we switched off the breath and the air function thus the battery lasts longerour daughter likes the otter however i find the constant price fluctuations between and quite questionable for i would definitely not have bought the otter
3,cant wait for season binge watched all seasons in rewatching few episodes absolutely love handmaids tale but this is not for the faint hearted it does not only have suspense it is also very dark bold and a bit scary even at times it can seem too depressing but it is also awesome great cast great acting great cinematography eyecatching costume great story
3,its a pure performance pc with limited incentives everything is great except that its doesnt support ghz wifi and seperate adapter would be requiredin todays time dual band router are everywhere and both ghz and ghz are essential
3,the colors in this dress are much less vibrant in person the scoop of the neckline is very wide and deep i know others have posted that this is a great dress for work but not in my workplace
3,i love the peplum tanks that retailer puts out but sadly this one did not work for me the print is vibrant and the colors are even brighter in person the the material made it look cheap the fit in the bust was off i felt that it cut too much into the bra area and the poof part of the peplum hit me at a weird spot on my torso really wanted it to work but maybe it would look better on someone more slendertaller than me for reference im and usually wear size l in retailer
3,a small masterpiece in an incredibly beautiful nature and perfectly filmed the superficiality of the rich people who are so saturated that they no longer notice the beauty of the surroundings when doesnt get really close to the characters but i dont think thats really the aim of the series either an excellent and wonderfully weird series about the superficiality of wealth
3,this would be great on someone with a slim build its very true to size it hits above the hips and runs pretty straight through the body for a boxy look i loved the color and pointelle detail but on my thicker build it just sort of hung in a toocasual way note that it is the kind of cotton that is likely to stretch with wear and spring back with cleaning
3,this would be perfect except for the ridiculous attached scarf the material is so soft and luxe the colors are richer in person and perfectly go with everything but the attached scarf ruins everything the scarf is not flattering and takes away form the cute buttons on the front if the scarf could be removed it would be a great sweater coat so disappointing
3,good price works as expected nothing much more to say abt a microsd card honestly the frustration free packaging is really good definitely better than the retail packaging
3,i got the pilcro hyphen chinos in a size p and they fit so i assumed i would be the same size in the pilcro stet chinosnope the p was way short and way tight im and about lbs my mom is and lbs and they fit her so i gave the p stet chinos to her to keep disappointed
3,this shirt was strange the bow tie was too thin and the dots were too dominant on the shirt it looks okay in the model picture but when i tried it on the bow and the dots just clashed
3,except better disappointed tq
3,good basic cake but i dont care for oily foods so i added another cup of pumpkin and only a cup of butter as we all knoweverything is better with butter i also added a tsp of vanilla tspnutmeg dash of ground cloves if you use a x pan its a bar andmight want to check prior to the bake time stated x pan is a cakeamp will take longer to bake since its thicker remember you shouldonly take bake times stated as a estimate of time needed rule ofthumb every oven is differentand tooth picks never liealways check it a little earlier then time called for say to minutesand lastly think about what ratio is called for in a recipe before youstart mixing it you can catch misprints etc before its in the ovenand to late to fix if you think about what youre mixing
3,in itself it is a sweet cuddly toytoy but the price is too high
3,great looking shirt that i bought for my wife but poor quality the fit is great but the buttons literally keep falling off first time my wife wore it two buttons just fell off when she was sewing them back on she showed me and another button just came off with the slightest tug its really too bad because it looks great otherwise
3,i ordered this online and was completely underwhelmed in person the pattern didnt pop at all and the fit was just ok it kind of bunched weird in the breast area i usually love plenty but this is a return
3,overall performance and battery life is great i cant say the same with build quality it feels fragile also it has the shittiest trackpad which stopped working completely in just months the lower body is replaced in warranty but such problems too early is not expected they opened the whole laptop and now build quality is even more degraded since then
3,this is in my top shows ever lizzie is oscar worthy and is one of the best actors on this planet probably of all time i wont add spoilers here just know that you have an emotional rocket ride awaiting you
3,the great jenny ortegas performance here brings a little more depth to the character than weve never seen before its as if she was born to play wednesday production value from design costumes props and the like are all topnotch excellent score from danny elfman of course the not so great fairly predictable story arc some plot holes most of the supporting characters are two dimensional and serve no other purpose other than to be a foil to the main character they really have no life or backstory lastly the motherdaughter rift between wednesday and morticia just didnt sit well with me the addams always was and always should be a close knit family the ick the dialogue really does every single sentence wednesday say to a male character have to include patriarchy mansplaining toxic masculinity coupled with threats of bodily harm i get it shes all about girl power but it gets really cringey after the th time result a solid and worthy of a second season
3,love the show and happy that netflix is adding a series that isnt total fluff the attention to detail is amazing and jenna ortega as wednesday knocks it out of the park however i echo many others in saying that the casting of the adult addams morticia gomez fester is way off theres absolutely no chemistry between morticia and gomez plus gomez is supposed to be tall dark and handsome fester falls flat with fairly bland line delivery so disappointed especially considering the incredible performances of actors who played these characters in the past i literally wouldnt mind if they recast them nevertheless excited to see this series continue to unfold
3,first let me start out by giving a reference i am lbs dd i usually take a size in maeve esp if there is no give i bought a regular size first the good the design it is classy it will keep boobies the ones of the larger side in place this is amazing as there isnt really a way to wear a bra with with dress it is slimming and i have hips the bad surprisingly the fabric gets dirty super easy i have no idea why everything clings to it i got my dress f
3,i love the concept of an airy flowing sweater that has great detail this item stole my heart online however i am fairly petite and it looked like it was drowning me the neck line is decently wide and my small frame couldnt hold it up it kept falling off my shoulders i ended up returning i think it would look and feel fantastic though if i were taller and had broad shoulders
3,the button detail on the sides is a unique design detail i had fun playing with different looks that came with unbuttoning and buttoning the sides but i decided against purchasing this top it appeared shapeless on me i have a curvierathletic figure and a straight up and down cut is not flattering on my figure
3,this show was one of the best shows i have seen i was so excited for season and they deliver this confusing mess im starting to not like june so many plot holes and inconsistencies the first few eps of season were building up to being amazing except we ended up having to watch help groups for the women whoever wrote and directed this crap should be put on the wall
3,go for gb or upgrade from gbram gb ram is not sufficient for this lap
3,i was excited to receive this top and wanted to love it however the side ruffles flared out more than i expected it didnt look right on me so had to return it
3,i adore a good vest so when i saw this one at my retailer i had to try it on immediately i dont wear cream often but the design and weight of this vest is dreamy i tried it on at the store and i was on the fence so i bought it took it home and tried it on with everything i am a curvy girl and i wasnt thrilled with how this fit now its part of the retailer athleisure line and i could definitely see this being worn post workout with cute workout gear girls who are tall and thin or even w
3,pretty good product a little disappointed with the weight of the plush with the mechanism otherwise the sound is goodthe more negative point is the scratch to have access to the buttons to change music and others that makes a lot of noiseif not sweet pretty and especially the main one my daughter loves it
3,cropped and wide would look cuter on someone who is more petite was too wide and cropped for me very sheer
3,the display is so bad in all angles except for straightviewing i suggest you never buy any laptop that doesnt have an ips or an oled display otherwise your whole experience will be bad and you will regret the battery is decent hours designwise its good if they had provided an ips panel with this display it would have been an allrounder in this price segment
3,poor battery heats up
3,its hard enough for women to find clothing that will make them look as beautiful as they feel but add a bigger bust size im a dd and it makes it this much harder i ordered this top because of how beautiful it looked on the model and the price when it arrived i was so excited retailer does such a beautiful job with the way they handle their items it was wrapped beautiful and no damage i ordered a size knowing that my chest could be a potential problem the too itself is gorgeous i did
3,reacher was absolutely terrific its an action packed thriller that knows what it is and doesnt try to be anything else alan ritchson does an incredible job as jack reacher i think hes going to surprise a lot of people by just how good he was this show will keep you hooked and on the edge of your seat throughout the season and i cant wait for future seasons once you start watching it youll want to binge watch it as quickly as possible its doing amazing for amazon as its quickly become once of its most watched series ever so much so that it already got picked up for another season only days after season came out reacher is easily one of the best new shows ive seen in years
3,tried this on and loved it except for one thing the sleeves are split so any movement reveals most of your arm shoulders which also makes it fairly impractical for winterthe office yes i could wear a sweater or blazer with it but that defeats the purpose of having an allpurpose cute top why retailer this is a perfectly cute top and looks great with jeans etc but the split sleeves make it a nogo
3,i gave this recipe three stars as canola oil is so unhealthy i used organic coconut oil instead plus about a tablespoon of butter i used cup of sugar and used large overripe bananas instead of two i didnt measure but it was probably more than the cup of bananas called for in the recipe in addition because of the extra banana i was able to cut the eggs down to one but i did use a large eggi added cup raisins and cup chocolate chips as my family likes that but they arent necessary as i tasted the mixture before baking and it was plenty sweet i wasnt sure about baking it at degreesso halfway through i upped it to degrees i dont think it made any differencebut i do have a convection oven
3,overall ok but battery very fast drained
3,i purchased this shirt online i thought it would be perfect for work but when i tried it on i couldnt even button half the buttons it is also extremely seethrough and even a nude or white cami underneath would look really odd need to return unfortunately if the top came in other colors i would return for a larger size but i cant deal with seethrough work tops
3,this is such a cute top with so much potential soft fabric vibrant colors and flattering fit on top however like so many of retailer swing tops lately it has tons of fabric at the bottom making it billow in a very unflattering way i ordered it in an xxsp so i cant even go down in size so this top regrettably has to go back i love swing tops but retailer could we please have tops that do not double for maternity tops
3,i was really excited to get this top but unfortunately its going to have to go back i am and usually a s fits however this was really tight also the material is really really thin for the pricetag save yourself some money and avoid this one
3,when i started watching this back in i thought this was horrible and way too real i cried out of both sadness and anger many times throughout the story as time progressed and things changed in the us i keep thinking gilead is closer than we think really bone chilling to watch knowing women are being charged with murder for miscarriages and their bodies being kept alive as incubators now in absolute madness everything about this production is excellent the story is flawless and acting on point the music colours and lighting sets the scene perfectly definitely recommend for everyone
3,i just finished making this soup and i believe it has potential i did follow the recipe however for my personal preference this soup needs more flavor the beef flavor and velveeta are not enough to increase the saltiness perhaps just simply seasoning the ground beef while cooking will be enough i am going to make this again and experiment
3,excellent opener of season the scenes with rip kaycee and tate were great at the beginning were amazing i was shocked and happy with the outcome from season s finale
3,all the first season had going for it was a fantastic witcher in its star henry cavill who looks like he jumped out of the video game series and some interesting action but the story was extremely uneven it lacked cohesion consistency and was to a certain extent rather bland after having watched episodes of season i can say this show has definitely improved the story is much more concise and to the point and the cgi has much improved henry cavill remains impressive as gerart and the new cast is much closer to the series than some weird casting options in season overall season is already way better than the first and has brought the witcher to the place it does rightly deserve as one of the best fantasy series ever produced it is also apparent that the producers have decided to focus on moving on with one main plot much like the games has one main story i expect that the witcher will only become better from now on it seems to have escaped the great trap of our times which is to focus more on paying tribute to wokeness and social messaging rather than remembering that the most important thing is to take a great story and bring it to life it would also benefit from more long shots its meant to be a fantasy series not a court drama i imagine its a budget issue but not all scenery needs cgi thank god we live in a beautiful world filled with woods lakes and mountains so go out there and take some wide shots people
3,overall ok
3,i was so excited to try out this top since it was such a bargain and neutral unfortunately the shape is a line and accentuates the hip area a bit more than i find flattering so it will be returned
3,size up i was surprised that the fit was small i always seem to wear a in retailer pencil skirts this was tight
3,great experience so far only thing its not a con but yes if you using on battery use it for normal purposes on battery laptop looses almost of its performance but yes on charge its a beast in this segment i do get framedrops here and there in very heavy gaming for ai cdr and psd they all run smoothely even when i open all of them at once
3,beautiful top marred only by the armholes i tried a small and a medium but alas my bra showed under the arms i my be overly endowed for this top but the way it cuts you would have to be braless to wear it not for me but wish it worked it is really pretty
3,this runs really large i love it sold out of xs p and xxs p go figure size down if you are slim
3,the fact that i watched all of these episodes over a two day period says it all great writing great cast great directing great cinematography great set design great lighting it really transports you into another world and is written in such an engaging way that you keep wanting more amazingly creative making a series like this is like an act of god the writers producers directors and actors are up against tremendous odds its pretty amazing to think that they could keep the train on the tracks for so many episodes and truly deliver it was especially fun seeing such a counterculture sarcastic and funny main character truly refreshing all around
3,i wore this coat one day and the buttons started falling off it stretched so much im going to beg my local store to take back it shouldnt fall apart like that its super duper cozy though
3,this would have been a perfect jacket for a trip im taking light weight and very stylish however the jacket runs huge the arms are long but it was the shoulders that were too big i wear a size mostly in retailer clothes i ordered the large and the shoulder seam was about past my natural shoulders i wont return for a smaller size because the fabric being wool i should have checked its unbearably itchy esp around the neck you could wear a long sleeve top and a scarf but then it
3,i dont know if theres going to be a second season but the eight episodes i just watched were the best tim burton ive ever seen i have not been a fan i have waited for this moment here it is the casting was perfect writing was fantastic sets were amazing makeup wardrobe and effects were spoton stunning funny scary and like the cast writing and sets they revealed the story to us with nods to people we love books weve read places we know about and nightmares weve had if its just going to be eight episodes then bravo well done but if you can do it again then i will be sure to have food and water next to my remote control next time and bathroom breaks because bingeing eight episodes of a superb supernatural show wow pace yourself breathe now push play time to watch se again
3,tim burton finally produces something that puts out the dumpsterfire of a career hes lived for the past decade disagree get on your own critical review though somewhat formulaic at times still mostly enjoyable the current cultural zeitgeist really preying on that millennial nostalgia am i right especially if you cast a significant actor as a secondary mentor figure in a macabre mystery thriller it kind of spoils its own ending jenna ortega definitely carries most of the interest in the show right now her deadpan delivery get it outshines riccis wednesday stardom the current inclination to campy horror really suits her aura and the performative dance in the raven dance sequence reminded me of a young pulp uma thurman if she studied interpretive dancejust incredible i added an extra star to round up whatever overall rating i would prefer for this show
3,the first season of wednesday was absolutely nailbiting the great screenplay and incredible casting made it one of the best tv shows ive ever watched every episode left me on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next the characters were welldeveloped and the plot twists were unexpected but wellexecuted though the story line is quite different from the cartoons people have grown watching and are used to it is easy to follow with stranger things penultimate season coming next year wednesday would be a great replacement for netflix overall it was a thrilling and satisfying viewing experience
3,season isnt all bad the show did get me to feel invested in seeing ciri find her true self but it is taking a long time the monsters need to get a better agent or join a union they barely get one monster per episode i suppose its understandable because i never feel any doubt that geralt or ciri will take down the monster season attempts to step into the game part of game of thrones and focus on politics none of the characters seem clever enough to pull it off i cant take my eyes off of yennefer and that doesnt hurt i am intrigued by the different mages i find triss interesting and i would like to see her more in the story geralt jaskier and the elf warrior played by robbie amell are the only male characters that are interesting to me all of the other men are forgettable to me including the fire villain the brotherhood people the various kings and princes and others i cant even remember i read other reviews saying geralt plays a secondary role in season i agree he does seem to be on the sidelines especially compared to season i think the show got bogged down in the ciri story i would have had her find herself and control her power in season so she could have more action sequences in season like ciri this show is having trouble finding itself is it an entertaining action show that doesnt require much thought or is it a characterbased political drama interspersed with a great action sequence and amazing special effects like game of thrones i would have suggested sticking to fun action with witty dialogue while adding more depth to the characters every season
3,a long time agoand oh my has it been a long time since we have watched anything concerned with star wars that captured our hearts and minds until this st episode everyone had been worried we would get a total farce of a production but everyone connected to this st showing deserves a slap on the back loved it totally loved it throwing in baby yoda was genius i truly hope every episode continues to follow up with this amazing start
3,when i started watching this series i was sceptical after watching mandalorian fett obiwan which i found flat and predictable andor has a completely different tone and nerve that far surpasses the other series it is engaging has fleshed out the characters and is not predictable at all you never know which direction it will take i think it is a combination of great direction script and the acting chopps of the main character it has a darker tone that applies well to the colorful and at times glib star wars universe i already looking forward to the next season of this series and curious on how it will connect to rouge one the post credits scene of the last episode of season one was great
3,the fit is quite strange on me as the tie is very high on the waist this makes the jacket look odd and quite voluminous i was very impressed with the fabric though but will have to return i wish retailer would post what size is the model wearing maybe she is wearing a larger size than usual which falls lower
3,i was not very pleased with season too but it was a good watch a singletime show with no review value but after watching season i realized that first season had a lot more than this its like game of thrones season hoping for a good season but getting a rushed plot and nonsensical writing
3,awesome stuff watched it in one sitting great characterization decent acting the scene where alexandra daddario crying saying she made a mistake while talking to her husband is the best acting i have seen from her and one of the best i have seen in general if you enjoy a good drama you should definitely check it out
3,came out really soupy next time would add chicken broth by only a fraction
3,beautiful got several compliments when wearing it does not hold up with washes though threads unraveling everywhere i am thinking of returning it for this reason fits true to size i am lbs xs fit i am smaller on top
3,im about episodes in i havent read the book or seen the movie i find it decent so far nothing spectacular though the series is not true class but its entertaining enough i usually enjoy this type of series so i suppose this is not up there so far with the very best im gonna watch the rest of season but i doubt i will watch season
3,i was hoping to wear this dress on my wedding day before the ceremony im pounds usually wear a i ordered this dress in medium and it hangs off of me it is not straight as it looks on the model but bells out from the waist the sleeves are so long that they covered my fingers
3,very low audio output for the laptop and build quality is okay not so good
3,product is good performance ok but battery backup time is low
3,good but not as amazing as i had hoped by the reviews
3,i have read all but a few of the reacher books not because they are a marvel of language and storyline they are a relaxing easy read the casting was fantastic reacher should be that big bulky dude i really liked tom cruise in the movies but he wasnt the reacher i had envisioned reading the books the acting was absolutely horrible in the second season plain and simple i had to force myself to finish watching and loved when it was over they somehow managed to make the book completely uninteresting by trying to make the characters super cool when they are just cringe worthy i doubt i will be watching the third season id watch it if it was tom cruise as he at least can deliver on the feeling
3,i loved the design of these pants and got them to go with the matching jacket the problem with them is there isnt enough stretch to keep them up i found that thru out the day i was pulling them up as they would slide down the pant fabric should have had more stretch or they should have put stronger elastic at the waist
3,overall the product is good and the oled screen is also too fantastic but the charger adapter and the laptop both gets heated very high when i plug the charger to charge the laptopi had been using since month sometimes it also starts lagging
3,this is a comfortable tunic piece with ample rear coverage it is lightweight and there is room to layer a thin tank top underneaththe ivory is a marled heather with ivory buttons it is not anything special in terms of style but it will serve the purpose of being a casual separate for around the house or for a quick errand
3,this recipe is a place to start hard to imagine how boring it would be as written we roasted the vegetables added sauteed onion and a list of seasonings onion powder basil marjoram white pepper paprika and made it a little thicker and it was very good
3,ok in this price range good for basic usage
3,i love the universe build in this story its a really realistic but at the same time scary scenario that is not as far fetched from how reality could play out if the wrong steps and decitions are made i like the characters and the cast but after episodes i give up nothing really happens it is slow which can make a point in itself but in this case it is over the line and simply makes it waste of time to watch i dont even really care about what happens next because it has lost me on the no action at all one movie could have been ok but seasons of many and long episodes is simply too much time to spend on watching no development in the history i really wanted to like it
3,costner is brilliant writing is riveting pure entertainment last kingdom seal team and this are the best shows on tv
3,just online class use ok
3,the new reacher looks and feels more like the books with the main actor stepping in instead of tom cruise who acted the part but was nothing like the books write teacher as the first season was the first time we see the new teacher and it was a refreshing take on the series towards the end of the first season and now seeing the nd season but i cant help the main character looks the part but is a little wooden i know reacher is supposed to be a little like that in the books but there are times when it feels reacher is reading from a script and the nd series falls into the csi magnum reboots of generic american polished team series at times all feels a bit too chummy when all you want is for reacher to be reacher and bit more rough and ready if you can get past that its an easy watch would be great to see some more of the books made into a new seasons and see how this reacher can develop
3,im usually a or size l in retailer and when i tried this on buttoning it up from the bottom i was so exciteduntil i reached the chest it was way too tight in the bust and i am not that big in that area it was painfully tight on my d chest its also unlined which makes it not very useful for anything other than the warmest times of year its a shame because the skirt is swishy and a good length many trenches are too short or not wide enough on the bottom for a fuller figure i
3,i love the color coralpink and the open shoulder design of this top but its too blousy at the bottom way too much fabric i ordered a small i am and lbs i might try an xs if they still have them in stock fabric is comfortable the ties on the sleeves add a special touch
3,i ordered this in a m and it was just a big boxy tent i really wanted to love it since the length is good for leggings and throwing on to cart kids around it just was so big and had no shape at all its possible i should have sized down to a small but im sending it back
3,enjoyed the show very much wish there were more episodes but also glad they didnt put too much filler in hopefully there will be a second season catherine zeta jones made a pretty good morticia but angelica huston is still my favorite luis guzman was not right fit gomez though he is more comedy that debonaire and to me doesnt compare to raul julia jenna ortega was good at not emoting with her face and just using her eyes i loved that christina ricci had a role too i did not know that wednesday was an aspiring crime novelist and the way it was worked into the plot was perfect but easy enough to figure out
3,this dress is adorable the color is on the red orange side and is nice for the summer the cotton is also nice and light however the bust is cut short and the skirt is unforgiving to girls with hips if you have bc cup or less and do not have an hour glass figure then this dress may be for you
3,killing performance must buy
3,i will keep it short and sweet for potential buyers looking for facts and not bsi own two of the gb size of these cards for about months now they do work fairly well with cell phones and tablets yet not so good with cameras in fact these cards failed to work with my gopro hero camera and the customer service rep from gopro claimed and i happen to agree with him that this card is not a true class card let alone uhsbenchmarks with my evo g with all allocation sizes the write speed never passed beyond mbs while read speeds wondered around mbs far below advertised speeds well write speeds arent technically advertised probably because they are of class levelbenchmarks with crystal mark reported speeds even lower due to adapter with write speeds around mbs while read speeds wondered around mbsneedless to say if you are not worried about speeds and only about storage these are perfect if you want to use them for shooting high definition raw footage however i suggest you not to loose your money on this because even if your write speeds are around mbs as the card begins to decay it will slow down to become uselessagain this review is based on gopro camera and high definition raw recording for cell phones or for storage it works perfectly well with a bit of false advertisement
3,wish someone warned of the navy one being not as pictured i ordered the navy because the crocheted part appeared to be more intricate than the ivory in reality the navy knit is just like the ivory it seems well made but very delicate im not a fan of tops especially pricey ones that require a camisole but this top is a very retailer piece so most likely i will keep it just a bit disappointed
3,the first season as all the reviews have shown was great all the acting was fantastic the cinematography was great the script was great so into the second season before the minute mark why why would any teenage girl or boy act like an idiot act like a selfish selfcentered individual who couldnt care less about everyone and the system that is keeping her alive after living in a zombie apocalypse for years why cant we get a show where not everyone is lying to each other at minutes doesnt she realize that zombies are attracted to noise or did she forget everything she went through over the several years and i see the politics in this before the minute mark also why cant writers think that just maybe people will smart up and care about others will just maybe work together to create a better living condition in a zombie apocalypse oh and lets complain about the quality of dope after years in a zombie apocalypse in the middle of winter sheesh thank you for your time
3,i wear a typical in coh jeans and i ordered these in a they fit but they feel more like jeggings than skinny jeans the wash isnt as faded out as in the picture and at the rip is right at my kneecap i bought these for the distressed wash and will probably return this pair as it looks darker and less faded in person i look nothing like the model does in this pair of jeans
3,this dress is really gorgeous really fun and beautifully made im typically an petite lbs dd so i got this in an and it was huge on me there was so much extra room in the chest and the back and it was much too long for me even if i sized down it feels a little age inappropriate for me im and it felt very conservative and unflattering i think this dress is excellent just not for me
3,remember the uma thurman dance in pulp fiction maybe the et jump in a byke with the moon behind or maybe that epic scene where wednesday creates a reverse riot in a play of the summer camp in the old addams movies that spice of classic feel that we no longer have in any series or movie anymore since the s well we thankfully got it here we got many classic moments that made me love cinema and tv again and wednesday such a great character its so funny and perverse and vulnerable at the same time that sarcasm is gold the only problems i found in this series is jenna is too attractive sometimes it was hard to concentrate when i couldnt take my eyes off the actress guilty they miss the original addams song this show needed it to become a real classic and the cinematography has the same flaws all modern productions have excess of blue lights and orangeyellows at night i guess its like an industrial formula to make everything faster and cheaper in the s we had beautiful cinematography in movies because they didnt abuse of blues and yellows they really took their time to make of cinema an art saddly the cinema and series of the last decades is too industrial and theres almost no artistic value anymore which makes all productions cheaper and faster to make but with a huge drop in photography quality besides that everything else was better than i expected so so good
3,i like the feel and color of this blouse however i was very disappointed with the sizing i usually wear medium so i ordered medium for this blouse it fits way too big it is a bummer because the curve is not even visible when i wear it
3,this top is lovely but fits like a crop top and im very shortwaisted i wore it with highwaisted jeans and was tugging at it all day i think it will probably work better with a skirt the colors are beautiful it has a nice retro vibe recommended if you dont mind the crop factor
3,i was a bit skeptical at first especially after the awful new star wars trilogy and the few disney movies and tv shows this serie takes its time and the story and characters benefit from a good writing and people who dont just rely on their fame and hype jj abrams but who really get an interest and love with the star wars lore theres a good mandalorian lore which is quite developed and serves the story not like the sith lore which was completely underused in the rise of skywalker even the art direction and filming is better than with the last sw movies so great job favreau and all the episode directors and well done disney for not ruining this show
3,everyone has their own rebellion vel sartha e the axe forgets but the tree remembers arvel skeen e the empire has no moral boundaries why should we not take hold of every chance we can let them see how an insurgency adapts karis nemik e has anyone ever made a weapon that wasnt used luthen rael e ill be thinking about you all the time cassian well thats just love maarva andor e oppression breeds rebellion luthen rael e can one ever be too agressive in preserving order syril karn e lets call it war saw gerrera e power doesnt panic cassian andor e i burned my life to make a sunrise i know ill never see luthen rael e im condemned to use the tools of my enemy to defeat them luthen rael e the imperial need for control is so desperate because it is so unnatural tyranny requires constant effort it breaks it leaks authority is brittle oppression is the mask of fear karis nemik e there is a wound that wont heal at the center of the galaxy there is a darkness reaching like rust into everything around us we let it grow and now its here its here and its not visiting anymore it wants to stay maarva andor e
3,touchpad is defective rest everything is great
3,i loved this dress the minute i tried it on and am actually really sad that i had to return it however the embroidery was unraveling in several places before id even worn it so i thought it would probably only get worse too bad because its gorgeous and flattering
3,giving stars due to how big this dress runs i am lbs and i was swimming in the xs it is a beautiful dress just beware it runs very large
3,reading all the star reviews i thought this would be a slam dunk it was good but disappointing not what i expected i have another similar recipe thats the keeper so i will stick with that one
3,the white is completely sheer i am so tired of see through shirts even at the sale on top of sale prices i wouldnt recommend this shirt if the fabric werent sheer it would be a very comfy shirt with a cute back but it just looks silly with a tank top under it the cotton just doesnt lay right
3,this is not always a comfortable watch however the direction production and acting is second to none good to see a production that presents an alternate world that could be true
3,nice budgetaffordable laptop
3,good one
3,i absolutely love the fit of these jeans they are perfect in length and fit nicely on the hips they are fitted and look nice with boots but they do not feel tight at all because of the legging material legging material while comfortable typically feels thin but these do not and they are quite warm the one major drawback is that the pants have pilled on the thighs i have had these pants for about months now and i have washed them and have hang dried them about times i have neve
3,this is a lovely wellmade piece by maeve a longtime favorite of mine the material is great weight and wont wrinkle colors are vibrant and design of the dress is cute if a bit on the short side however i like some of the other reviewers didnt love this this on me the waist hit slightly above my natural waist and im very shortwaisted and this particular sweetheart neckline did nothing to flatter my bust im a dd for reference the end result was a bit too dowdy on top with
3,the geometrical pattern of this sweater is slightly asymmetrical with nice geometry to it the colors are more muted and subtle as compared to the picture i was very excited to see it through its transparent bag unfortunately my delight faded after i pulled the sweater out first it weighs a ton a thread for each color runs around he whole sweater hence much more thread went into it than in a typical sweater second it runs large i am usually an xl or but this sweater has lost of
3,i ordered this blouse as a gift for my mom it is too pricey to live up to my expectations it is quite sheer and the hem of the sleeves are unfinished which you cant see in the pictures this makes a very expensive blouse look cheap it is made of viscose and dry clean only the material used is not on par with the price in my opinion if it had been real silk or another natural fiber ok but for me this and the unfinished hem along with the price is a deal breaker for me
3,i ordered this top online and was hoping to love it however it didnt fit me properlythe arm holes were much too large im typically an xs or small i ordered the small and based on this fit i dont think the extra small wouldve fit either also i thought the material seemed very delicate and somewhat thinand with kids always hanging on me i dont think this top would last very long
3,this shirt is not awful but not anything pretty theres a reason the main photo has the model with her arms crossed over the waist it runs good on top and then you get to the body of the garment and it runs straight down yet the pleats even make it manage to expand a little but then you get to the lovely detailed hem which reins them in so now you are left with a bit of a poof effect making you rounder in all the wrong ways its one of those im too lazy to send it back its not that awful
3,this lift weight cardigan is true to size perfect for fall or spring colors are quite nice especially the little pops of orange
3,great laptop in low price value for money
3,im lbs curvy and fit im usually a size but when i tried these shorts on they were tight i sized up to an and they looked better but overall the fit was not flattering on a petite curvy frame i think these shorts would work on someone taller and a bit thinner in the thigh area
3,looks so cute in the picture but just didnt really look that flattering on plus the sleeves were too tight and too long for my short arms so going back
3,potatoes great chops just ok
3,this is a well made blouse with a pretty neckline the print with the sleeves makes me look really wide its an odd look
3,the colors in the green shirt are beautiful however the cut looked like a maternity top on me im not very busty must try it on to match the right body type im thinking very tall wispy less curves
3,this caught my eye and i tried it on the in the store today the green i found it to run a little bit large i expected the small to fit but the xs fit me better better fit in armholes and also less billowy i really like the way it looks but ulitimately did not purchase it today i might reconsider on sale the flaws in my opinion are that it is dry clean only the skirt is not lined and should be and its a bit overpriced for the quality but on the other hand its very cute and f
3,ok so when i bought this in every color there were no negative reviews i loved this shirt it was amazing fit perfect was so comfortable then i washed it ahhhh it shrunk so bad my year old could wear it i washed it according to the tag then the second color i just hand washed in ice cold water and laid flat and it still shrunk man i wish i could return these shirts they are so bad and i typically love bordeaux quality these are horrendous
3,this dress is stunning no doubt a shimmering forest green under a black teardrop motif thick material nicely cut with pocket panels that are forgiving to a belly however the fact that this dress has zero stretch which is fine if thats what youre looking for coupled with what is quite possibly the cheapest zipper ever manufactured make this dress exhausting to put on im normally a at retailer and i ordered the just to be safe and the waist is exactly the size of my waist
3,i love these pants bought them in the mustard color my only complaint is that they are not colorfast i washed them in cold water with other colored items most of which belonged to my husband not good and pretty much ruined an entire load of laundry except for these pants retailer please color test your garments there is really no excuse for fabrics like this to run in this day and age
3,lovely knit and so soft but the bottom curls up underneath similar to the bell sleeves runs oversize too got xs and its too bulky and unflattering since the bottom doesnt lay flat returned
3,is lagging some time
3,this beauty caught my eye online and i was excited to see it in store the coloring is lovely but it was too short for me and just mehand it was only on for a second before it started itching sadly too the sleeves were all stretched out from the way my local store merchandised it which looks cute on the hanger but kind of ruins the clothes i wish theyd stop doing this if it works for you great because its a decent price for a timeless sweater with an interesting color patter
3,i snagged this the first day i wore it with my wedding ring it is very delicate and i cant wear it when im with my kids because they pull on it so much it will just me by night out wrap i guess
3,i was wondering whether to purchase this top and decided last weekend during the off event i would splurge i got the m as im tall and it does look a little strange on the arms atleast on my body the sleeve is cut too high for me i wish it was longer or even a longsleeved item the peachapricot nude colored fabric is a little uncomfortable and the fabric close to the neck is a different grey from the other sweatshirt pieces the sweatshirt pieces arent particularly soft eit
3,for some reason i thought it said cups flour i was wondering why i had to double that aside from me reading directions wrong its a fantasic basic recipe i would say add a tiny bit of spice to the water before mixing i added a pinch of garlic salt onion powder and italian season and just wow such a small amount of spice can go a very long ways
3,i took this too to the register thinking it was marked down to same price as another tee by the same brand it wasnt so i ended up paying way too much for a thin tee will probably return
3,this was good not great
3,too floppy light and comfortable material but the tieneck needs a shirt with a bit more structure
3,unfortunately this piece has a very boxy cut and the white layer is stiff and billows out i am tall and thin but this made me look pregnant very unflattering i considered trying a smaller size but i did not like the material too much either so i just returned it
3,this fit well but the top was very see through this never would have worked for me im glad i was able to try it on in the store and didnt order it online with different fabric it would have been great
3,the outer layer runs large up top also the orange stitching the flowers on the outer layer are extremely bright orange rather then a fall brownish orange that would match the layer underneath im returning it because for the price i dont love it
3,i think this is probably a fine product but it wasnt compatible with my samsung galaxy s phone formatted as exfat as it came from the factory didnt work at all but thats a known problem with the gs but even after reformatting to fat the card caused my phone to reboot multiple times
3,i love the color and style of this sweater and was very eager to wear it which ive now done on two occasions but now im concerned about the quality and also wondering if there is a long version of this sweater and a shorter version i am and thin but the sweater doesnt hit me mid thigh only goes to upper thigh and i measured in length on my sweater rather than which seems to indicate a shorter length than on the model i wish it were longer more a problem is that the fuzzy pa
3,never liked the sound of this until i tried it this recipe is a good starting point i almost always change things to my taste i have used leftover grilled cheeseburgers in this and the flavor that is added from the grilling was amazing also have used some smoked cheddar i had on hand or some spicy nacho cheese from a can i garish with your regular burger toppings tomatoes pickles a fried onions mushrooms great soup
3,jennifer coolidge is a real delight without her and her characters storyline this show would be nothing yes it is dark funny twisted and the writing is creative and imaginative but ultimately watching a bunch of miserable rich people despairing over the emptiness of their lives depressed me more than it entertained me more importantly it felt like something i have watched a million times before i watched this show with some significant delay after it was hyped the way that it was i was really disappointed as i had expected something fresh and innovative season was okay season was just a repetition of the same stuff brought nothing new to the table and i have no idea how they are going to make season work without jennifer coolidge honestly without her im not even interested in the show
3,basic laptop for general purpose positives fast booting ms office pre installed keys and body is strong enough for regular use could be better very basic sound quality viewing angel if you tilt it visibility distracts no indicator lights on keyboard side of laptop indicator for num lock and caps lock missing missing backlit keyboard rest is best in laptop brand is renowned and can be trusted upon
3,u can only use the laptop while charging only dont buy this laptop if you prititize battery i do only coding and in hour of battery is over think before buying
3,is it possible to fall in love with a fictional character i do believe that i have a crush on jack reacher i have read every book that lee child has written about him and each one has been a standalone classic there were a couple that were not great but the majority are well worth a read that being said i was waiting for the consummate reacher on film dont get me wrong tom cruise is at the top of his game in almost every movie hes in but i never could buy him as reacher although his mannerisms were a fair representation of the character hes just not big enough alan ritchson not only embodies the look of reacher but he has the speech patterns and moves that you would expect this character to have his words are spare his muscles are unbelievable and after only one episode i can see my day being devoted to a binge watch of this series amazon thank you you have made me a very happy reader and now i will be a very happy viewer
3,i waited impatiently for this item to come in stock and when it did i had it overnighted because i was so excited to receive it its hit or miss with me as far as retailers mediums and larges depending on the brand i generally err on the side of caution so i ordered the large it looked cute out of the package but when i put it on i was terribly disappointed it flared way out at the bottom and was not as fitted through the waist as on the model this could have been the large sizing but
3,i love the series i love henry cavill as the witcher he is the only man who can pull off the part he seriously carries the show dont get me wrong all the actors are great but without cavill i have no more reason to watch it im stopping after season i wont be able to tolerate another actor playing geralt of rivia i hate when hollywood replaces an actor on movies or television series i understand when an actor passes but other than that absolutely not it ruins the magical essence originally created that captured the audience after that it just feels second rate its very disappointing its heart wrenching
3,i purchased this micro sd card to add storage to my acer tablet unfortunately the tablet did not recognize the device after uninstalling the card several times i decided to use it in my samsung phone and it works fine thereif you are going to buy this product for a tablet i recommend you do you research and make sure its compatible
3,definitely size down the waist and chest were baggy in my normal size s
3,the gopro seems a bit finicky about card speeds since the last firmware upgrade i applied the cards ive been using for quite a long time started causing it to randomly report errors and stop recording i got a couple of these sandisk cards and ive got the hero powered via the usb port so i can fill the cards repeatedly without running out of battery no errors reported so far and ive completely filled one card twice and the other three timesi havent always had the best luck with sandisk but these are working well so far fingers crossed that they last a while i use the camera to record offroad and brisk dualsport rides
3,overall the laptop is good voice is a bit low not loud for any general meetings in a silent room you can listen to music or watch movies the display is below average the viewing angle may disappoint you and is not meant for long hours of working may overheat during game play you cant upgrade your ram because it is soldered on the motherboard after that everything is awesome good for college students its performance never disappoints you
3,if youre looking to compare this to a dont give a caretom cruise movie dont bother this series is more than you hoped it would be and its
3,i was so excited to receive this romper its a great material but its actually a bit drab the colors are very bland and the flowers just hang its not flattering as it is very roomy
3,laptop is good for this pricebut display is not good it looks like a yellowish colour while viewing
3,screen size is small if we compare to other laptop
3,i am sure these pants are right for someone just not me i am wider in the hips and they just were really unflatering the fabric is very lightweight which i wasnt expecting and so while the pleats are interesting with my hips they ended up hitting in just the wrong place the waist was also much lower than i expected not low rise but im used to thinking high waist with wide legs in short these pants are probably great on some body types just not mine also very long im and a
3,purchased on sale would have never purchased at full price runs small and runs short will be returning
3,i feel bad writing this because everyone else liked it so much but for my family it had no kick at all chili is suppose to have some kick right if you like your chili runny and bland then i guess this would be good
3,i saw this shirt online first and immediately knew i wanted to purchase at least two colors i went to my local store for the mothers day sale and tried it on in the blackwhite and the coralnavy i purchased both colors i actually wanted to get all three but had some other items i prioritized over the tealwhite it fits great and is super comfortable i have been wearing the black and white all day today and sadly it is already pilling and doesnt seem to be holding up very well photo giv
3,i have seen and purchased these at lower prices so i was disappointed on the cost but i needed them pretty quickly and i knew sandiscs are good sd cards
3,heating so much
3,battery drain very fastoverall good product but battery backup not good
3,really wanted to love this top but it was too boxy for me really pretty deep wine colors and a great plaid but overall it did not give me any shape and it was returned
3,for reference athleticmuscular body type broad shoulders slim hips im a bit confused on the sizing for this especially based on other reviews mentioning they needed to size up i ordered the xs and i was swimming in it i usually am quite comfortable in size small so im not sure why the xs was still too big perhaps you need hips for this dress to work because it was really just hanging on me and not figure flattering at all im not sure if ordering the xxs would make thi
3,this top does sit weird feels like a circus outfit but at the same time its unique in its own way i ordered a large and it was true to size in shoulders and chest area but larger and wider waist down probably because of the way this top is styled im ft tall lbs i have curvy body and small chest a and i felt that top was a little too cropped for my long torso but i kind of liked it anyway material is nice and soft for both grey wool and white cotton
3,not that my good performance is slow
3,display is very badgo for ips panel
3,lee child is to what mickey spillaine was to look it up reacher is a binary entertainment product it either works or it does not cruise one of the most powerful hollywood hitters missed this version is not bad spillaine wrote novels right to the end child wants beach time and passed the franchise to a family member that never works well banshee was a better production reacher however has an instant worldwide audience no contest
3,this dress is very pretty colorwise but the fit did not work for me i could see this working on girls with narrow hips but it didnt flatter my narrow waistwide hip frame
3,loved it my partner and i binged it in days its quirky its abit odd the music is amazingly strange but we loved it all wish there was more
3,good product fast delevry value for money sound volume is very low not clear
3,i loved the look of this online and ordered the xs as maeve seems to run large and that was the smallest size offered the length was good for me only the elastic top fit well b but then from there it was too much fabric i thought this would be a straight fit or a slight aline but it was just a huge amount of fabric on meseveral inches on both sides big i think with the large ruffle along the top and the tremendous amount of fabric hanging down from the dress underneath the ruf
3,although the blouse is pretty it did not fit me well i downsized two sizes and it still didnt hang well on my body i think it looks great on the model and would probably look better on a thinner person i am disappointed it did not work out and i will be returning it
3,let me start this review by saying of my clothing is from retailer and i love them my husband bought this sweater for me recently and its gorgeous but when i tried it on one sleeve was longer than the other i went to the store and tried on several sweaters even in different colors and had the same issue sometimes is was extreme sometimes is wasnt as noticeable it was noticeable to me however as i am and sleeve length is super obvious when its too short love the sweater as it wa
3,stellar acting and well written show the peach pie looks delicious and the dinner is cosy all the technical stuff that drives the plot is explained well and believeably i am sorry for the non sense writing but imdb requirtes me to write a whole lot but i would rather try to not spoil anything how about that weather aye
3,performance battery design display value for money
3,i carefully read the reviews and decided to order a medium since that size works for me generally with floaty styles the neck was a bit small but once over my head it fit and looked nice the deal breaker for me is the huge droopy armholes that showed half my bra the colors are deeper than shown but the pattern and length overwhelmed my shape feeling a lot like a maternity top i liked that the sides are shorter but overall its just not my style better suited i think for taller slimmer bod
3,reacher is an exmilitary man he takes a bus to the small georgia town walks to town to look up an old blues singers home immediately gets arrested for murder but eventually works with local law enforcement to help solve the mysteries and there are several
3,i loved the dog on this sweater and i rushed into the store to buy it once i tried it on like others i did find it to be itchy but that i could deal with using a tank or something what bothered me the most was the way the arms were cut my arms looked much bigger than they are so sadly i left it at the store it really is a cute sweater though
3,for reference i am and lbs with an hourglass figure and bought a petite instead of my usual because i wanted it to be a bit shorter with the aline design the skirt fit perfectly but the waistband is not stretchy like the rest of the skirt the quality is great but the design and color is not the skirt is actually much darker of a red than in the picture more like a dark red wine it is super aline which was not flattering on me and the layers are all individual pieces of fabric
3,i will make into a cake next timedelicious
3,run large and leg is very wide even sizing down they seemed too floppy
3,audiovery disappointing keysvolume and brightness key is not working got an issuest day writting your device ran in to a problem i was not able to fix it easily
3,the fabric is wonderful flows nicely and soft i am lbs and usually wear between a s and m i ordered a s in this due to the majority of reviews and found it to fit my shoulders well and length was fine after reading the reviews i was so excited to get it but for me it actually made me look larger there was too much material for me on the bottom and it actually made me look like i had a pooch never a good thing i thought of returning for a m as i thought maybe it would have hung
3,the dress fit fine with two exceptions first i am and i ordered a petite the dress was dragging on the ground so it would need hemming if i were keeping it but the deal breaker was that the gathering of the outer fabric over the bust stuck out an inch beyond my d figure which made me look like i had very oddly shaped nipples i made the assumption that the dress i received was defective so sent it back but unfortunately the replacement fit the same way the lining fabric fit
3,i love the wide straps but it runs small and is short still great for layering great soft material i hate that it is so tight and short but if i size up them the arm holes would be way too big
3,mixed emotions about these the crust and toping is lacking something i think maybe a sweeter crumb topping might be better
3,it takes an awful lot for me to like anything fantasy based it usually isnt my cup of tea at all i always get the impression that harry potter and lord of the rings are at the forefront of the genre and they didnt do it for me they were good dont get me wrong but just not for me im more of a horror fan than anything especially zombies but something drew me to this so thought i would have a crack i was still a little unsure after the first couple of episodes this is why i rated a and not a as it didnt quite drag me in straight away but after just finishing season one i am officially hooked henry as the lead is amazing as are all the other main characters it is well cast well acted and a great story so far love it
3,a generally likeable adaptation of a lee child novel reacher is much more physically imposing as he should be than in the tom cruise movies although im not convinced about the guys acting then again he was never a deep character and he certainly cuts it in the physical stakes the plot is involved and expanded slightly from the book to fit the eightepisode running time and the action is decent ill watch a second series
3,my rating for seasons now im watching season and after episodes yellowstone is becoming more and more like a too annoying soap opera dont know will i continue first of all production values cinematography and music in whole series are of the highest order netflix disney etc should watch learn from the good old paramount but there are too many repulsive characters in the series in s also too much melodrama plot holes and inconsistencies literally the only good thing in s were the first half of st episode and some of the scenes about everyday life of cowboys at the ranch beth is just a functioning psychopath you know even nazis loved their husbands wives fathers but that doesnt mean that they werent evil kelly reilly is a great actress dont get me wrong the actress who plays monica is just awful painfully mediocre and the character of monica is just awful without any logical development and everything about poor caseys wife is well awful casey is the only likable character among a main roles in the series too dependent on awful monica but thats a life i suppose jamey is pathetic coward and helplessly spineless its not the actors fault of course john is well like a godfather from famous movie trilogy kevin costner plays his part very well this is probably a role of his life johns alleged blindness for beths sadism is psychologically understandable but irritating in the same time taylor sheridan is a fantastic writer just please mr sheridan control your ego as an actor your role in s is so annoying my final rating the first half of s included but probably i will take a longer break and move to and
3,very well done the characters are great the acting is very good the music is perfect it gives all the right feelings
3,its nice too see a very good world as star wars in a series i just hope the creators keep producing these as the future obi wan series or even the possibility of a vader serie its just awesome i cant wait to see how this one ends
3,i think the model is wearing a larger size per the first review i am and lbs and the xs fits about the same in length but not nearly voluminous so you should order up if that is what you want this will be perfect for some long summer flights instead of a wrap since the sleeves will be more convenient and i always look schlumpy rather than elegant in a shawl if it had some cashmere or another softer fiber i would be totally in love with it
3,this dress is pretty and is somewhat fitted in the bodice it does have an aline fit in the skirt the stitching is beautiful honestly the stitching was a little too bright for me some may like that but i was hoping for a little more toned down or muted the colors are so vibrant in my opinion it almost cheapens the dress the fabric is cotton and it is not lined i am and it does hit right about where it does on the model i am sending it back because i didnt say wow i love this w
3,these are the cutest prints but the cute simply doesnt work for me this is longer than the conversationalist shirt which is an improvement as far as im concerned nevertheless both my appropriate size which i still felt was too short and the size up which hit at a flattering spot were twice as wide as as my midsection so while the arms and shoulders seem true to size the shirt runs very wide
3,value product
3,sound quality is very poor
3,not sure if there will be a season but the first were great the mood and cimetography of peaky blinders is particularity well done oh yeah and the acting is pretty solid all round too
3,tried this dress on today in the store i am a size sometimes a size the size was the first size i tried that zipped all the way up however it was still very tight around my stomach and bust and then from having to size up it flared out too much at the bottom for my liking
3,laptop is well but it is made with low quality fibre and easily breakable so hardware part must be made durable
3,wow season was a breath of fresh air while not completely aligned with the book it complemented it enough to be engaging to me season a slight drop but still a show that was engaging albeit straying from the book more season glaring garbage i see why henry wants to leave the writing is terrible in fact beyond terrible and they are striking for more money lmao they need to go back to school and learn to write step stick to the book follow the book keep to the storytelling path and style dont try and reinvent netflix your writers are not good enough hoping season changes things but i doubt it items to note i do not fault the actors the writers are terrible at their job i fault netflix for destroying a fantasy series similar to lor on amazon prime if your afraid to follow the books correctly then dont make the show hbo should have done this show the only network with the guts to make a show right
3,if your a fan of the books you know tom cruise is no jack reacher this is an excellent adaptation of the reacher books and ritchson plays the character very well to find someone that big who can act must have been daunting in fact all the acting was done well and you soon find yourself rooting for this team centered around reacher there was something too about the photography that i cant quite explain but i felt i was watching from my minds eye like reading a book if theres a style for this i would like to know what its called thanks to the producers for creating a show that this reacher fan hopes will be more in the future
3,loved the material but i didnt really look at how long the dress was before i purchased both a large and a medium im and there was atleast of material at my feet the gaps in the front are much wider than they look felt like the dress just fell flat both were returned im usually a large and the med fit better d in jeans
3,while the cut drape and shape of this dress are very attractive seeing the fabric in person was disappointing to me its clearly wellmade and there are abundant highquality details however the combination of a largeish pattern and the wrinkly thin cotton still felt kind of limp and cheap i sent it back
3,in k its ok but i have doubts on this long term durability performance is also ok ok
3,as the other reviewer said this top is pretty short nice design but i wish it was a little longer and i am short i tried on xxs regular xs petite and xs regular xxs was closest to flattering around the top part shoulders cehst but stil la bit short the petite was jsut too short and xs regular a bit longer but a little loose os hte fit jsut ddindt work i may wait for sale on this but probably something beter wil lcome along great for those who want to show their assets
3,they were ok pants but too small the texture and shape were not what i expected either
3,binged both seasons in a few days best show ive seen in long time i pray they keep it going for years to come
3,this dress i ordered the ivory is stunning it is fully lined the belt adds a needed accent and the print on the fabric is gorgeous the fit though is another issue i typically wear a depending on the cut and fabric of dresses and am pretty proportionate with my hipsbust i ordered a in this dress it was enormous on the top and painfully tight on my hips and thighs the fabric has absolutely no give it needs to drape perfect or it looks awful if you have any type of hip thigh
3,a lot of reviewers have been saying that this dress is simply too busy to be wearable and theyre right i love the cut and fit of this dress but dont love the style the awesome stylist at my retailer told me to take off the belt and then try it on with a ribbon like the one on the charisma sheath and it was so much more cute it completely changed the look of the dress and made it look more classy the belt looks very cheap in person and a little hoochie mamma if you wear it with the dress i
3,great style but not so great quality stone fell off right away but they still look great
3,if your a fan of the books then youll love this show finally a actor who can properly portray jack reacher like the book i like tom cruise but he is no jack reacher please please please make a second season of this
3,i wanted to love this romper but it just wasted right for me i am lbs c curvymuscular frame and ordered size small i may have liked it better with more room in the medium decided to return i still recommend trying this product but it wasnt for me and my hips
3,bottom line ritchson is head shoulders above cruises portrayal of reacher no pun intended i think casting cruise was banking on the audience not knowing the story here we get ritchson who truly embodies the character which even lee child is not shy to point out alan actually read all the books to prepare for his role hes been in a lot but this will be the role that defines his career i think willa fitzgerald is perfectly cast as the small but mighty detective sidekick there are a lot of great cast here including jenkins and white who perfectly portray the brothers in their youth seasoned viewers will see a collage of familiar action scenarios and characters here although the lack of uniqueness doesnt detract from the great presence of the series on its own merits in fact ritchson could be said to resemble schwarzenegger and cruise with a bit of jcvd the show reminds me of a cross of hardy boys jack ryan justified and the equalizer just to name a few there is a good story good action and some clever humor but beware there is some pretty shocking visuals in this series parents should not take the ma rating lightly if we still had the old system it would be rated x for extreme gore and nudity never mind the bad language and frequent blood spatter
3,was not flattering on my body i have a fuller figure and this just made me look like i was pregnant
3,i ordered a large and was hopeful that this would be as comfy and stylish as others reviewed for me it was not it ran a little small on top buttons bulged at my chest and was hard to put on bottom part fit well although flattened my butt unflatteringly im sure this works for some just wasnt the right fit for me sent it back
3,i am a huge fan of the series and have been since the first game so was the most skeptical given hollywoods track record with video game adaptations suffice it to say they nailed it the game is incredibly narrative driven with long cutscenes and immersive environments that fully envelop you in the story hence the game has always felt like living through a movie which is why i was so skeptical about them going holluwood with such an incredible piece of storytelling shot for shot recreations great casting and the same score composer for the soundtrack as the game brilliant genuinely excited for this
3,you could go make a cup of coffee or two or three and not miss very much honestly this is boring as heck and moves so slow snails over take it well lets review what happens in episodes thus far well basically nothing it has taken episodes for a big nothing burger to take place i have a feeling this will end up being a one or two season bore wars shows then abandoned like the rest seems to be disneys mo these days spin off a ton of stuff dont follow through with much this sets new record for the most boring sw of all time i was almost begging for jar jar binks to show up just so there as some decent dialog and some action
3,this actually might be the best tv series ive ever watched cillian murphys acting for the role is just incredible
3,absolutely no nutrition in these whatsoeveryou even feel like youre eating rubbishbit never the lessmoreish and very quick and convenient if you need to eat something on the fly
3,i love the length of this and that i can wear it with skinny jeans or leggings but it does seem to run a little small and it is not as long as on the model i do think it is a cute addition to my wardrobe though
3,dark secrets and twisted truths of the guests the staff and the locale of a resort are unveiled over the course of a week that was supposed to be a relaxing vacation if ever a tv series shouldve stopped after season and not followed up with a watered down season its this one the characters plot humour and atmosphere are very good in season one and the humour is on point its a really enjoyable watch and very entertaining we were invested in the characters and wanted to see what happened next however withing episodes of season two we dropped it and havent gone back proof that its hard to replicate success with a weaker cast weaker storylines and scripts that arent as funny
3,very pretty dress and nicely made the embroidery is quite lovely and double lining as mentioned by the other reviewers is awesome but not a good shape for me and my hourglass figure like a lot of swing dresses it has no structure and its not a good look on someone a little busty as i am in all honesty i thought the sacklike shape of the dress made me look lbs heavier than i am i am a medium size and took the based on the other reviews i probably could have sized down to
3,i loved the actual design on the fabric the flowers are gorgeous and i was really looking forward to wearing them but the fabric was much too thin for me i was surprised because another review said they were thick to me it felt like tights material almost however they were not see through which is great overall they just didnt look great on my body size curves medium was a bit too loose
3,i am a curvy size i loved the colors but found it looked maternity when unbelted and there was too much bunchy fabric at the waist when tied i tend to like things that emphasize my waist however
3,i wanted to love this top but had major problems with it first its not for short girls im only tall and it was a total mess on me proportion wise the sleeves were way too long and the seam where the sweater and peplum meet hit right in the middle of my butt which was terribly unflattering second the grey fabric was very thin and kinda cheap looking no regrets on returning this one
3,what can i say these scores and when people say its the best show ever i am sorry but its not as well as its not the worse show i would say an is pushing it but i can let it pass i havent played the video game but if a series is based on a video game or book i probably think the books and game is better just like the witcher or tombraider now why do they have to associate a strong woman as an unsffurable one like ellie and make the joel a pushover example of a likeable strong woman laura croft ripley and sarah connor also what is it with episode why they have to include a gay couple just for the sake and they have no relevance to the plot
3,i agree with the other reviews that the sleeves can be tight even for those with slim arms life would be great in this coat if my arms were always down by my sides but when i lift my arms thats another story i also agree that the material wrinkles easily this is a highmaintenance item as far as pressing and ironing goes it is a very pretty feminine coat but i would reconsider this only if it goes on sale
3,very good recipe but not enough spice very blandtoo many noodles left over and not enough ricotta sauce to fill last layer i dont make lasagna so i followed the recipe exactly as it said
3,wow sure glad i clicked on this starting out i didnt know if the man guy was just eye candy but turns out he can act as well as the girl he hooks up with goodwin who i recognize from the work cant really act but his character was good and he didnt butcher it its reacher so its gonna get a little far fetched but it actually is more believable than the movies were hope this is popular enough for more seasons but its gonna be hard for me to lose that girl cop she was the best person in the series she didnt die but you know reacher hes a wonder
3,best packing and products
3,this top is adorable and has a looser fit as shown on the model shot so i would have liked to size down however the arms are extremely fittedtight and theres no way i could have fit my arms into the next size down if you have slim arms maybe you could size down and make this work
3,i really loved the look of these color blocked leggings online but when i received mine theyre nothing like the ones in the picturesthe front of the legs on mine are mostly orange with a thin strip of white between the orange then more orange i like orange but really was expecting the pretty color blocking like in the pictures not mostly orange on both front legs the back of the legs have more color blocking but barely any of the light lavender color
3,nyc performance like office work editing but battery issue
3,i love jumpsuits and was excited about this one because i liked the printcolors and that its longsleeved i ordered my usual medium size im a solid medium it was a tad tight in the rearthigh area not flattering when you have a thin material which shows every bump unlike jeans but the length im and top fit well i returned it and ordered the large but the waist was huge and thats coming from a person with a bit of a tummy bulge and there isnt anything to cinch the waist in
3,super cute skirt i decided to return it because i felt like i didt have enough tops to go with it
3,sweatersi couldnt pass it up unfortunately when i raise my arms my tummy shows im so i had to return it
3,as other reviewers have noted this is a pretty top i really love the design alas however it is too big for my frame for reference i am barely and about lbs i ordered my usual xxsp and the fit is just not flattering on me it is looser than on the model and the flounce does not hit me in the proper place the top is also too wide so that it has these odd gaps near the armpits i highly recommend this top unless you are an xxsp i am going to have to part with it sadly
3,display and speakers are bad
3,got this laptop for k even computer ups battery performs better than this
3,first of all its a budget laptop specially for studentscollege university secondly design is good specially the natural colour gives this device to an outstanding look rd system is too fast gb ram ryzen th for educational purpose this laptop is more than enough th disappointed with the displaywarm in this price segment hp must have to offer an ips display th battery backup is too short and also they doesnt give any option to stop charging in a limitlike read more
3,not bad it came out a little plain and had no taste i followed the recipe without any changes i would add more salt and seasonings before baking this dish i added seasonings and hot sauce to this after i noticed it had no taste and it eas then edible and i didnt mind it but my husband barely touched his plate so i wouldnt make this again
3,oh i am so utterly obsessed with this show wednesday is everything and dont even get me started on her character development because my god did that make me an emotional mess love how realistically painfully slow it happened too it was so bittersweet to watch the plot twist towards the end which i was deep down fearing though stung a tiny bit since i was really into that whole part of the show too and was rooting for wednesday but its making me even more excited for a second season which is hopefully happening special mention to the very likeable characters of edin and eugene and of course thing
3,i wanted to love this shirt its got a thicker material a flattering shape and the uniqueness for a basic top however when i put this on it just looked like it was illfitting over the chest i think if the pull was below the chest it would be much better
3,netflix does is again i was worried that they could ruined it but i was completely wrong it is the best netflix show ive ever seen the cast the soundtracks you feel like youve felt when youre playing the game henry nailed geralt of rivia thanks netflix and all the cast members im loving it
3,very good i subtititued escarole for spinachexcellent
3,having watched the first episodes wow so enjoyable and so jack reacher alan ritchson is so reacher the mannerisms the silence but also taken something that was good in tom cruises version and used it to good effect having read the book a long time ago seems faithful and the pacing is perfect needs renewing immediately great show but never let reacher ask you to dance
3,this is a great series quite addictive i finished it in sittings the acting is great the production quality is superb the story is also very good quite addictive my only real complaint is that the flashbacks are a bit confusing at first after the first few episodes you get use to it and know the different storylines which makes it easier of course to follow highly recommend
3,i ordered this dress before it became available in my local retailer store i love the style of this dress but the fabric was not as expected it is a heavyfuzzy knit and i had envisioned something lighter and cleaner i would love to see it in a different fabric sadly returned it
3,good but not excellent
3,this serie is really good despite the crits are saying they supposed to say things that would reflect peoples opinion but its not what happended in this show its really good with lots of action beautiful scenarios and amazing actors
3,this isnt a show where people whove read the book are likely to be irritated very much by differences in the production there are a lot of similarities but additional content that fits in very well the book is really pretty brief so there is a lot of potential material that could be filled in and the creators of the series are doing that superbly in my opinion some elements of the book are absent most notably the white supremacy aspect of the imagined republic of gilead there are several good articles out there explaining why but overall the show aligns closely to the book the idea of a future where government is a theocratic nightmare for everyone but upper class men is certainly plausible given the examples of religious extremism we see in current life its no stretch at all to imagine that there is a contingent of extremist judeochristian males right here in the usa whod love to turn the clock back a few hundred years to the days when white men ruled the earth so to speak the republic of gilead is a christian version of the islamic state though the structure seems to be all based on old testament stories rules the show illustrates the horrors of what could happen if the separation of church and state did not exist in america its certainly a wake up call for anyone who thinks it couldnt happen here the explanation of how gilead came about provides a very plausible progression of events that might be used to effect such a change in government the creators of the show have done a great job with casting the actors are fantastic ive watched all the available episodes and i cant wait for the next round next season will begin pretty much where the main section of the book ended so i am eager to see where they go with the story
3,performance is good but the battery drains very fast hrs on normal usage disappointed
3,this top runs full sizes large had to send back and didnt want to bother with getting a new one
3,i love this skirt and wish i could keep it but it is not for the vertically challenged i am lbs and the medium petite was about in too long even with wedges my intent was to wear this with sandals so i have to return boo
3,i ordered this and there is just so much fabric in the pictures i think it is pinned in the back in the main photo to make it look more streamlined definitely a miss
3,i should have paid more attention to the reviews of this sweater before ordering although the material looks soft and cozy in the photo its very scratchy and uncomfortable i was also hoping the opening of the collar would be a little wider which would have been more flattering on me i never wear turtlenecks of any kind so i took a chance on this im sure others will look fabulous in this sweater and may be happy with it if they dont mind the texture im sending it back
3,it tasted good but needs some alterations for starters it wasnt very soupy and could use either some water or another can of chicken broth good starter recipe that could be great with some improvements
3,lovely dress and looks great on me but with just my second time wearing this dress and reaching across my desk to pick something up i feel the elastic waistband snap this dress is definitely my size and i have felt no tightness or discomfort in the midsection i have bought cheaper clothes with better elastic waistbands and had them for years now i will spend the rest of my day looking like im wearing an orange sack im not pleased
3,like the other reviewers i agree that this sweater is waaaay shorter than it looks on the model i think shes wearing a large size and its probably cinched in the back still cute though im and a medium fits well looks cute with highwaisted jeans which i wear anyway
3,i ordered it in two colors because of excellent reviews nice material but fit is not for me i will be returning them
3,i was really pulling for this dress to work because its beautiful however the neckline is cut so extremely low that i had to return its much higher on the model than in real life the petite length was still far too long so additional hemming required otherwise fit was true to size lbs size p
3,after using this laptop for months this is honest review display outstanding battery decent sound quality disgusting performance outstanding although i faced some glitches earlier design decent but can be better if they give metallic body it could be much better heating it produces heat on heavy gaming but acceptable
3,lotion works pretty good however pumps into a oz bottle and the csmart pumpd stopped working theyve designed the bottle so that you cant screw the pump off like weve all done in the past to get the last of the lotion out i was determined to not loose a entire bottle of lotion so i had to cut the top off with a box knife word to the wise advoid the smart pump
3,worst display quality and mouse pad
3,i bought this in navy and love the multi textures and look im happy it was on sale because it is so cute but i would not have paid full price on it it runs small i plan on wearing it for casual errand days
3,giving it a few extra stars only for a change i had to makemy rice noodles looked a lot different than in the video and i think that made a huge difference unfortunately
3,this is a cute dress but just not a keeper for me the top portion of the dress is fairly snug i am normally a small in retailer sizes but i would have sized up the keep the dress from pulling so much across the bust otherwise it was cute and simple and the tulle was quite soft i think that i would have gone with a medium but i am wearing a small in the photo for reference i am lbs c and waist
3,can you believe that mike white is in his s now since back in his late s writing for the seminal freaks and geeks white has been doing great quality work and now we have the white lotus it features a variety of characters brought into the same place a luxury tropical resort at the same time and in some ways this miniseries is whites magnum opus one things for sure although you may not be able to relate to all the many different characters here youll surely relate to at least some or one whether its the guests staying at the resort or the staff working there the newest member of the latter is so desperate for the job shes omitted a fact that ends up dramatically changing her first day standout performances are provided by the wonderful jennifer coolidge and character actor murray bartlett as head of staff armond and connie britton and steve zahn are both as good as always as the parents of a couple of troubled teenagers navigating their own issues i rate it but you dont have to take my word for it its been nominated for emmy awards
3,not for gaming
3,ugh i was so excited to get this dress and for off this dress is adorable unfortunately the top part is super tight around my girls otherwise the fit was perfect very disappointed in the top of this dress
3,i really loved how this top looked and was really excited it to get it on sale i was worried that it might be too smalltight i ordered a m and would consider myself a m but was relieved to find it fit just fine i was extremely disappointed to find that it was too sheer to wear by itself and still showed my bra with a layering tank on underneath it was also more like a crop top for length which does not work with my mama belly
3,at almost lbs i always wear a size small however this dress runs large no i am not smaller than i was months ago and it looked like a dumpy sack on me too bad i really wanted it to fit it is a slightly heavier fabric than anticipated and would be an excellent travel dress i may try the xs
3,so i thought this sweater would be snowy white but its actually a beige kind of dingy color i do not mean that its unattractive i do like it just because it is not snowy white like i thought it makes it more of a casual sweater in my opinion and i was hoping for a dressy sweater it is very super soft and is as long as it is pictured it fits like a dolman sweater which i did not expect either its a bit fitted around the very bottom and sleeves are billowy at the topthe picture does no
3,its not totally apparent in all of the photos but this dress does have a very noticeable asymmetric hemline i have read other reviewers that have said this dress is forgiving and a good choice for people with an hourglass frame if you are truly an hourglass small waist larger shoulders and hips due to bone structure rather than weight this dress is a poor choice the fabric of this dress tends to cling to the outermost hip and the asymmetry of this particular hemline not only draws
3,it was interesting accentuated by some nice acting and good cinematography i enjoyed the show overall not that it was the most amazing thing i have ever seen but kept me intrigued enough to see whats going to happen next
3,battery and display are average otherwise it is a good product
3,it is a proper fitting oversized shirt however it is very flimsy and even seethrough as a summer weight shirt i returned it because i dont want to wear a tank or cami under it during hot weather
3,bought this top at my local store and tried it on as soon as i got home yikes it was way too billowy i looked like i was pregnant will be trying the next size down on in the store to see if it is billowy
3,so much odd stuff going on here with the cutfit the top is sort of tight in the bust even with a small chest the sleeves are dolmanstyle and are billowy at the top but then tight on even my skinny arms the slip plus the dress itself took me a good minutes to figure out how to put onjust too much effort it is otherwise a beautiful pattern color and length just a miss for me personally in the fit department bummer
3,doesnt make any sense whoever thought it would be a good idea to massacre such a franchise isnt very bright
3,i was very excited to find this jumper in a store to try on the small was huge im lbs the xs was better but perhaps a bit short in the upper body making it feel tightstretched against my shoulders i love the print and style and would have bought it if it was less however at the current price it needs to fit perfectly which sadly it did not
3,plastic laptop will get your work done nothing exceptional its an average product feels delicate be careful while using it
3,i loved the colors on this dress but i dont like the way it fits it is tight around the shoulders but the rest of the dress is really big and has no shape
3,years ago i watched the first trilogy of star wars for the first time this series takes me back to that afternoon it captures the mood of the original films perfectly more of this please
3,this top is really cute online but thats about it it runs large but even if i sized down the ruffles were a bit much and the top was a little boxy surprisingly
3,yes the body count is high yes reacher gets his man yes the fight scenes are on the side of unbelievable but thats the point the books are a rip roaring read interspersed with humour and some pathos this series is just the same sit back and enjoy it for the excitement tension and yes the jokes dont worry its not real life same way james bond isnt real life never stopped that being highly enjoyable
3,this cake was not moist at all i was very disappointed thickheavy and kinda hardi cooked it only minutes i liked the frostingthe cake had a good flavornot to sweet i couldt serve this until i could figure out what went wrong sorry
3,very boxy top not flattering on i will be returning
3,microsoft office is not given in laptop
3,i do not know if the gss have issues with reading cards of this size but i eventually had to remove this card and purchase a transcend gb class card just to check if it was my phone that was the problem when i got it i opened the packet and popped it right in recognized was able to start using taking shots and video and they immediately saved to the card without the hangup my old class card used to have after a couple of days i noticed that i would take a shot and the phone would give me an error that it could not save to the sd card you would have to reboot to fix when scrolling through the gallery on the sd card it would freeze and the app would crash i moved what i could formatted the card but the same thing kept happeningsince installing the new transcend gb card ive had no such issues maybe its just my phone but i think there have been enough complaints from gs owners to be a little skeptical about this card on their phones
3,its a pretty cheap card and has a good amount of storage but it has fairly slow write performance some competitors microsd cards offer much faster performance for similar prices
3,this picture does not do this skirt justice it is gorgeous however the waist was so small that the sequins dug into my waist making me think of a medieval torture device unfortunately it was the largest size so i cant size up im so the length was perfect it came to right above my knees i love the skirt so much that im considering liposuction
3,for a new laptop it seems a bit sluggish probably requires more optimisation sound output is extremely low as if non existent overall design display battery backup moderately good will do normal day to day work but dont expect anything more than that ram is soldered and non upgradable
3,was so excited for this top loved the embroidered detail and the teal green color i got it in a medium and it was swimming on me it also had a maternity type feel since there is a lot more material making it look blousy than showing on the model they must have pinned it back in the stock photo sadly its going back
3,great summer skirt can be dressed up or down the band top is weird but you dont have to style it as pictured i may get the top hemmed down the road i have a waist and got a size large
3,its an actual topic nowadays but i hope its only a vision not coming to the real world
3,i started reading the reacher series in during covid and the first book killing floor hooked me fast it was the first book in a long time that i literally had a hard time putting down immediately after i read the second book and now consider lee child to be one of my alltime favorite authors naturally i had already watched the tom cruise version before reading the books and liked it well enough despite not really knowing too well about the height issue fans complained about so when i heard amazon was going to make a reacher series i was skeptical im so glad i was wrong alan richman plays jack reacher wonderfully the first season although a slight departure from the novels st person perspective and understandable from a story telling standpoint was very faithful to the story and even feel of the novel they really brought margrave to life and the mystery and sinister of the plot worked well on screen the acting writing pace and direction was all superb and ending episodes on a cliffhanger despite knowing the story kept me in full binge mode to where i watched all episodes in days i enjoyed the show about as much as the book and cannot wait for season i really hope they continue with the rest of the books as long as amazon alan and child will allow if it can continue for longer ill definitely say with fill confidence that this is my top streaming show x better than the tom cruise films and im not saying they werent good but tom just doesnt feel like jack reacher after revisiting postbooks
3,note if you have a large chest the seams hit in an unflattering spot nice shirt just not great for the price
3,i bought this yesterday but today i noticed screen bleeding issue pls tell solution
3,bought this for samsung galaxy s in fall and that card works perfectly to this day bought the same card in may for galaxy s and it continuously mounts and unmounts sometimes it is not even recognized by s or pc amazon is awesome and preshipped a replacement it did the same thing though according to cnet sandisk acknowledged a manufacturing problem with these cards back in january said it was fixed but the bad cards must still be sitting in warehouses returned both and ordered samsungs gb micro sdxc card more and slightly slower readwrite specs but works perfectly in s and i cant tell the difference in its speeds compared to the sandisk that works in my s
3,the battery back up performance is very poor only hour backup in new laptop
3,this is a cute top but not worth the price in my opinion i love the colors pattern and soft material used however the fabric is quite thin and just not worth paying
3,heres what i liked great shape through body cool empire waist and good length loved the color more rust than red material was somewhat light which liked since i often get overheated in turtlenecks heres what i disliked the sleeves the reason they only show the model with her arms against her body is because the sleeves are ridiculous they are just too big and too flowy they will always be in the way of everything and there is no way to roll or push up
3,i wanted to love this dress as it would have been perfect for a wedding i have in october however the fit was awful the dress was heavy with a funky liner it also had these little black straps around the top of the armneck that looked out of place it ran true to size but i have a large chest dd and it was pretty fitted around the area but loose everywhere else sadly dress had to be returned
3,really wanted this to worked for me ordered the s in ivory the color i really wanted but xs was sold out and the xs in cedar loved the knit and look and quality but the sweater was boxy and huge even in xs not flattering on my petite frame so disappointed as ive been looking for a nonwool sweater like this
3,overall the build quality and sound of the laptop are commendable fitting for a gaming laptop however there are some areas that could be improved battery life for a gaming laptop a battery life of more than hours for normal usage is expected the laptop lasts around and a half hours when running demanding tasks like docker spring boot and vs code and around hours for web browsing document reading and daytoday tasks gaming sessions typically last between minutes to h read more
3,i ordered this in the pink color the fit was fine but i didnt care for how thin it was there is lining which i suppose is there to combat the thinness but its only in certain places the lining should have been all over maybe if i had gotten this in blue it wouldnt have been so bad
3,what can i say first season was pretty good funny well acted interesting to watch i really enjoyed it and had high hopes that the second one will be at least that good the reality was brutal and after a first episode i almost slept trying to watch it to the end but i gave it a chance basing on the very good experience earlier no i just finished rd episode and this isnt going to happen what the hell have they done with this series if season was rated then season is its like someone with no sense of humor and movie experience took it in his hands and screwed it completely thats a disaster a disaster give my hours of my life back
3,i loved this dressuntil i washed it the label says machine wash cold and lay flat to drywhich i did washed on delicate now its not the same dress its too short and not as soft and i feel so much differently about it i wish the label would just instruct to dry clean i would pay the extra expense to still have the dress i loved just kind of annoyed so its an awesome dress just be prepared to dry clean it or risk shrinkage if you wash it
3,heating issue and battery drain so fast maximum hours
3,based on other reviews that this top ran large i ordered this online in two sizes both seemed to fit alright in my chest although the chest fit tighter in the smaller size and both were much too big on the bottom the front bottom of this shirt has a series of pleats so the bottom of this top really really really flared out away from my hips the length seemed fine on me the material is very thin and i could see my nude bra through the white pattern
3,final episode season what the hell words fail me how can a show go from epic cinema on ya tv to epic fail on ya tv had to mark it down from to just for the last episodes seriously what are the writers smoking not sure ill be back for s quite sad really how shows just go way beyond their original storyline into a fantasy world no self respecting cowboy would be
3,pretty top online okay in person runs small especially on bottom hemline thought it would have a swing to it it does not more sheer in person than i thought it would be that wouldnt stop me from keeping it though it was the way it laid on my chest that was unflattering looked like i was wearing a bib i dont have a large chest just weird look on me unfortunate because it is an adorable print top made for thinner or a petite lady
3,this is a fantastic dress for fall if you have specific proportions the dress comes in sml rather than in particular dress sizes so my assumption was that a large would fit a range of the dress fits me well in the fitted waist which has zero give but the top fits very strangely you can even detect it on the model in the photo with a tightness at the clavicle and a weird abundance of fabric above the waistband i will still happily wear the dress with sweaters this season
3,not good only ok because i am also using dell i inspiron series that is to good i am using dell laptop in to till now it is working fine with hrs battery back up now i am using hp new laptop that battery back up is also same
3,review after months screen burnin observed i can see taskbar icons always oln the scree screen looks very good but actual quality is very poor warning note that this laptop is not equipped with a fan for cooling backside is getting really hot this will definitely reduce the life of the cpu extreme cost cutting use it only for simple jobs always turn on battery saver mode even a few chrome tabs can heat up the laptop and high tempe read more
3,battery drain so fast and quality of plastic is not good rest all fine
3,disappointed this didnt fit better the pockets stuck out on the sides and it was baggy through the middle you could also see the pockets through the outer layer of the dress the color is more like a chartreuse than the picture its really pretty
3,remember how amongst the lightweight drivel uninventive fanservicing and confused plottingcharacter arcs of the last batch of star wars films rogue one shone like a beacon of decent filmmaking well three episodes in and it looks like andor is doing exactly the same thing for the star wars tv series unburdened by the need to placate nostalgic adultkids that grew up with the original films or even the poor souls that grew up with the prequel trilogy and so have a nostalgic fondness for those or the need to pass under the scrutinous eye of the studious geeks who know how the force and hyperdrives work as though theyre real things andor is free to simply build interesting characters plots storylines and visuals to give us the dramatic framework for what is shaping up to be just a damn good story and adventure sadly like rogue one it also stands by example as a reminder of what could have been of what a terrible wasted opportunity the rest of this latest run of star wars output has been with just the occasional infuriating glimmer of quality thinly veined through obiwan and the mandalorian heres hoping the rest of this series manages to capitalise on this great start and leaves us with at least one more properly good piece of work in this third age of star wars
3,mrcavil carried the hole show the witcher nice world with a beautiful stories
3,battery is not good and i bought in k during the big billion day its price has reduced so dont go by offer they keep changing the price battery of hp laptop is havochp battery must be upgraded those who wants battery backup can go for other brands
3,how do you do the ganache the picture has it on before the strawberries but the recipe says to drizzle on tophelp
3,im keeping these shorts because they are cute i sized down as the previous reviews suggested and they fit great but they are snug around the legs i think i would have preferred a more baggy look but then they would have been too big around the waist had i ordered my typical size they are soft and comfortable the navy color is really pretty
3,i find this card seems to frequently stop working altogether and have to be reformatted or simply reseated its hard to know if this is the fault of the device i use it in a cellphone or the card itself so i cant really hold that against it but all i can say is thats been my experience with this card and not others
3,i wanted to love these pants since i hate superfitted skinny pants but they are really oversized im lbs and foot so im petite but not considered skinny and have well endowed thighs and legsbut the xs was way too big for me
3,this is an amazing spin off of the original addams family the visuals are amazing and it is one of the best netflix shows jenna ortega and emma meyers do an amazing job and made the show vivid and are one with their characters the script is a bit off somehow it feels like its a forced on the main characters side plots are not getting anywhere and the characters have to act a certain way that is more focused on the story rather than their own motives i am also not entirely sold on the characters and portrayal of morticia and gomez it is different than the original movies and story there is no chemistry and the characters looks are off based on the original description nevertheless if you dont compare and watch it as a show on its own it is a very good i laughed i broke down it is overall a very entertaining series
3,if youre expecting good battery backup please dont go for it and sound volume quality should be improve
3,this shirt is absolutely beautiful however it runs very small proportionwise its okay in the shoulders bust and back but its too short definitely order up
3,enjoyed seasons and as a pulpy space western thing writing wasnt anything to write home about but the action was great and the plot compelling watched season off the back of andor and it just seemed average by comparison maybe ive been spoiled by andors incredible writing and direction but you know the show has gone downhill when a ridiculous jack black cameo was the highlight in an otherwise pedestrian season coincidentally pedro pascal was not available on set for this season so i wonder if the lack of plot and character development is partially due to the shows lead being mia
3,the speaker is below average for this price range
3,i couldnt wait to get this dress from the online order the fabric looked so interesting to me linen appliquã pockets raw neckline the dress looks sort of straight up and down on the model but in my opinion its like a little a line tent the top runs very narrow and i could barely get it over my head im going to return it and try for a medium for reference i am and usually wear a six or a small
3,easy recipe but needs some help i will try using brown sugar and adding more ginger chicken was a bit dry
3,totally pretty but not crazy flattering a bit wide in the hip area if you are not tall good on sale but i wouldnt pay full price
3,i ordered a medium and it fit perfectly i am anywhere from a size lbs sadly i am returning this dress because the horizontal stripes make my hips look huge
3,i finally ordered this at this incredible mark downed pricebut i see why it is cute but serious size issues i have a bust but smaller everywhere else but i did order up because of it being a jumpsuiti would have needed more to even zip the top part i have many trendy jumpsuits in my closet and this is a first if you are flat chested you may want to try at this great price as it would be a great piece for sitting by the fireside next fallwinternever too soon to plan ahead
3,yes this series is a prison story its about rules injustice escape alliance rape and wrongful killings a community using ancient immoral beliefs to control the sheep the acting is absolutely superb moss and strahovski literally turn this series into the most intense series ive seen since breaking bad watch it you will not be disappointed
3,battery lasted longer than my first relationship hours listening to arijit singh songs on full volume since then still isnt getting overweak speaker has more warmth than her unlike her theres two way communication here as touchpad is very responsive fingerprint lock is nice as it only opens up to me stars for this for my ex
3,i really like the dress the material the print and the pleated skirt are totally fun however the neckline is a bit to low and a cami is necessary at least for me the material is very sheer which will be noted on the sleeves and the lower skirt where the liner falls short about inches above the kneethe main draw back i personally have with this dress is taking it off there are no zippers or buttons getting it on is easy not so when taking it off
3,though it has some slightly disappointing graphics at times the show is definately netflixs best original series so far ps only miscast was triss
3,i liked that this was a unique take on a sweatshirt pretty seam down the back and weight of material im going to return it because i wish it was a little more of a loosebaggy fit and underpattern is darker than i thought
3,recommend this vest nice design fabric is thicker than expected might suggest a size smaller plenty of room in loose styling
3,henry cavill and the fight sequences are the main reason to watch this series even with those redeeming features i still gave up watching around halfway due to lack of interest the series wasnt terrible but it lacked coherence and flow for context i played and loved the witcher but prior to that did not have any knowledge of the franchise or stories after being disappointed by the tv series i subsequently started reading the last wish many of the episodes in series are based on this book the book is far clearer and more enjoyable than the tv series in my opinion i found many episodes lacked exposition whereas the book makes clear exactly why things are happening there are numerous examples and nearly every episode has omitted key information that would have made the story more enjoyable another key difference is in the book geralt and his sidekick have a far more jovial relationship whereas in the tv series geralt seems to resent and be strongly annoyed by the presence of his main friend this backfired in an episode where his socalled friend gets injured and he goes on a mission to save him in the book it works but in the tv series you feel that geralt would be just as likely to leave him
3,season season season had something special and was interesting and refreshing season was better beautiful location great shots music and flair the story and the characters everything was just right unfortunately season is a huge disappointment the story doesnt pull me in at all unbelievably annoying characters and stupid situations that they cause all the time timothy ratlif family the father is just annoying extremely stupid actions the sons just ridiculous the situation later patrick schwarznegger is great though the girlfriends the story line was actually good sam rockwell i like him a lot his character completely stupid story just to shock just ridiculous rick hatchett character walton goggins is great but the character he plays is always extremely annoying completely stupid decisions and what happened at the end i knew that the situation was totally stupid in the last episode aimee lou wood has something i liked her character and i really liked her conclusion the best thing about season is the intro song by christobal tapia de veer unfortunately the rest is not so great mike white just wanted to overdo it in season and it doesnt work stupid characters stupid and nonsensical decisions that end in a finale that is ridiculous mike white should definitely hire good and talented writers because his ideas were not good if he wants to continue doing this on his own then the whole thing will not get better but worse now that christobal tapia de veer is also leaving the series i have great doubts that the series will get any better it may well be that the series reached its zenith with season and especially season
3,the other reviewers are right this runs huge why have a number of cute tops been running so large lately im and lbs and was drowning in the xxs petite it also almost reached my knees i thought itd be a cute little tunic to wear in the fall but it just looks ridiculous because of how large it is and how theres no taper or shape maybe even order sizes down the quality is pretty good if you can make the sizing work for you
3,very nice but its stopped working and its only got a month and it hasnt been for use and its not the batteries
3,after all the online hype about this show i decided to give it a go my review is for season onlynot sure if i will venture into season i can see why some people think it is all the rage and also see why others are not all that impressed i would probably rate is if there were half numbers as a on my scale usually means i would recommend it to friends without any preamble for most people i know this show would require some pretext no spoilers here in short there is nothing new here that hasnt been done before so unless you are rip van winkle and missed the last years or so you will not be shocked by any of the scenarios playing out that being said the production values are good and this would be a great glossy packaged summary of a lot of the edgy events presented while rip was sleeping i entered the series paying close attention to details and storylines then found i didnt really need to after a whilestories were familiar pacing was somewhat slow and the soundtrack was cool original and interesting at the beginning but became annoying as the episodes advanced for some strange reason the soundtrack matched the storyline and felt like it was suggesting how i should react or feelfine to be supportive of a story but it became intrusive your mileage may vary in summary the first couple episodes were interesting the middle slow and the last episode a saving grace cut or hours out of this and i would rate it higherand change up the soundtrack more often a glossy show that might be your cup of teai think it could have done better season update ok i decided to watch season two with a friend who had not seen season one i must say a vast improvement over season onethe script flowed better the music was varied and the show didnt come off quite so pretentious some familiar actors from other shows that i have watched and enjoyed made it more entertaining i would give season a rating of for good entertainment season one season two wish imdb allowed half point ratings overall a
3,overall i felt that it was good and i felt entertained by the end of the series but it feltdone before specifically by the dark adventures of sabrina same teenage angst problems with the popular kids secret societiesits wednesday friggin addams i expected something different from the rest much like wednesday herself on a side note catherine zeta jones while picturesque and visually appealing has zero screen chemistry with guzman luis guzman as gomez was phenomenal while he didnt look like the gomez that i grew up with the movie franchise i totally bought him in the role jones however acted as if she were on fear factor and being covered in snakes while lying in a tank every time he touched her or tried to interact romantically with her i honestly dont remember her being that poor of an actress perhaps she is scarred from being groped by men she views as repulsive
3,i am a sweater girl so i was really looking forward to this cozylooking piece like other reviewers i found the fit to be very strange and not as pictured i am and lbs and typically wear xxsp or xsp i ordered this in the xxsp because of the loose fit it did not fit like the model at all the sleeves were shorter and stuck out oddly the length was not as long as pictured but it would have been fine for me had the sweater not also been as wide as it was long others suggested sizi
3,runs shorter than i expected i purchased on line but will be returning it for a larger size
3,this dress arrived today in such a crumpled and wrinkled state that i was reluctant to even try it on it is on the large size but fine if you are looking for a very flowing look longer at the front than shown in the photograph and i am i am sending it back it is a pretty fabric although shinier than expected i am just not prepared to spend so much time pressing and steam ironing this item every time i want to wear it
3,i bought this sweater the minute i saw it and waited for over six weeks for it to come off of back order it was further delayed from even what i was told when i first ordered it i was beyond excited when it finally arrived and wore the sweater the day after i received it i had a long flight and thought it was the perfect option for keeping comfy on a plane i was so disappointed that by the time i got off my flight four hours later the sweater had not one not two but three differen
3,im normally a and ordered the ml the body was a little big but ok the arms are really wide there are snaps to make them tighter but it doesnt do much i do like the embroidery its an ok jacket but the fit could have been better
3,i found that a little of this goes a long way as it is somewhat on the sweet side
3,i loved the lavender color on the cape it was soft and comfortable but the design on the front ruined it for me it took me all of minute to know it was going back it looked like florescent bird feathers nothing wrong with that it just wasnt my style at all i was a bit disappointed as it would have been perfect for cool ca nights it looked more subdued in the photo its not i clicked i would recommend to others as it is nicely made and i guess just not my taste as far as the colors an
3,now its good but final feedback will be shared after using it for a few days
3,i am about lbs and usually wear between a small or a medium i ordered a small as another reviewer did right when i took it out of the packaging i could see that it was going to be much shorter than you can tell from the online photo i knew the sweater was going to be cropped but it falls right at the top of my hip bones when i raise my arms up my whole midriff shows did not flatter my athletic build at all the fit around the shoulders and chest is fine skimming but not tight
3,i liked season but took issue with the time lines i didnt know what was happening and when was kind if confusing first watch acting was great season was top notch i felt the wrinkles in story telling were ironed out
3,i tried this on in the store and it fit like a tent on me it doesnt help that im and the store didnt have the petite sizes maybe on a teller person it would work better or maybe if i had been able to try the petite size it would have more wearable it is a comfy style and the natural fiber is a plus i have another holding horses dress that i love which also runs large i did not mark this as runs large because the sleeves are more true to size while the bodice is very billowy i wo
3,the snake and the studs they make the dress sadly the snake is hard to find as mentioned in another review this dress also runs large im usually a and went down to the images are misleading too two pics show a small fitted look and the other two show a full swing look im trying to make this work but it may have to go
3,ive never watched the original addams family or the recent reproduction but i did watch wednesday because it is considered the best show of the week and i needed something to watch i watched the entire episode series and have multiple thoughts to share the show is mid it is nothing special and nothing to fret about wednesday was very predictable especially the reveal of the villain and before something new was revealed you could guess that an episode to two episodes prior the show left many plot holes but the show wasnt all bad the acting by jenna ortega was great and i loved that she didnt blink really added to wednesdays character aside from jenna ortega though the acting wasnt that phenomenal and the characters were even somewhat anoying if you decide to watch wednesday youll see my point and realize that its an ok show and nothing more or less and thats why i gave it a
3,i expected to love this since i usually look good in this style of jacket its definitely comfortable and the fit was fine but i really dont care for the wooden buttons and the overall look was just meh its going back unfortunately
3,all its good but battery back up hr
3,i bought the orange color i had a hard time styling it as it is so long since it is a turtleneck and short sleeve youll need a jacket or sweater on top nothing looked right it has a relatively high and tight neck so sweaters looked weird short jackets didnt work either im and bought the small returned it for the charente cowl neck which worked much better
3,i am undecided if i will keep this dress or not i am lbs and ordered both the small and medium the medium was comically large on me with broad shoulders and a sacklike appearance but the small fit very well and felt very french girl chic the brownishgreenish color is really stunning in person like a greenish copper and the gathered sleeves elevate this into a dressier look but the material is sheer so you would need to wear a slip and the elastic waist still has somewhat of
3,not a deep story not deep at all never read the books but it feels like a story from som pocket book like mack bolan or remo for some reason all the killings are justifiable also to easy it feels like its a entertaining view action wise but cant understand the high ratings
3,will not make this again it was good but did not get fluffy like the picture and did not get firm when refrigerated maybe because i used regular jello instead of sugar free
3,everyone saying this show is slow and boring are definitely the type of people that cant stop scrolling through videos on their phone and were probably doing just that while watching this they think dialogue means they can now turn off their brain and just wait for explosions its sad the show is not confusing but paying close attention is so rewarding because you see the details and the elegance in the writing you feel for the characters their motives the weight of their decisions its beautiful i hate how a lot of ppl are giving it a low score to combat all the s and s its getting just be honest why you cant enjoy it i almost passed on and or because of a lot of bad reviews but im thankful to all the reviewers that still put their phone away for a bit and enjoy immersing themselves in the plot the show deserves it at first i gave this a but now im on the th rewatch and im shedding more and more tears each time i gotta change it to give it a shot peace
3,ill start off positive the main characters actor jenna ortega did a phenomenal job i absolutely loved her style and attitude and everything she was great and i will watch season two almost solely because of her portrayal of wednesday the roommate grew on me overtime but she definitely had the disney vibe that some of the show had which i really dislike the dumbing down of a lot of the lines which forced this show to seem childish i was really hoping for a darkweirdgrosscreepy vibe to the show but i feel that there was almost none of that it was surprisingly brightcolourfulvibrant which i think it also gave me disney vibes and lastly the writing at times was great but then many other times was cringey as hell like it seemed as if once they wrote the dialog they then passed it on to children to force in new slang or something i dont know what they did but it felt off at times now all that said im definitely keen for season two and will probably enjoy a rewatch of season one before i start season
3,this cardigan is very soft and feminine it looks nice on but it sheds everywhere i decided to pass on it when it got white fur all over the other clothes in the fitting room if you dont mind the shedding then i would recommend this sweater
3,basically a good product only unfortunately not thought to end the otter lies with in the bed and seduces to cuddle only unfortunately the otter together with the inside lying operating unit is very hard and heavy and when breathing it crawls furthermore this super nice shell on the belly so interesting to press around that is played rather instead of sleeping in addition everyone who has a relative skillful child notices that it also has the velcro closure open within a very short time and presses around on the control unit
3,i really like the color and flow of this dress the dress itself fit well however the slip was extremely tight through the bust i have a large bust at d however most dresses are still wearable especially flowy dresses unfortunately i had to return this one because of the slip
3,they are beautiful in person until you put the on the fit was a bit weird tighter in the waist roomy in the crotch the fabrics work against one another the vegan leather especially the detail pieces at the outer side seams is too stiff the back is thin and has far too much elasticity at i passed these will only enter my closet on sale
3,nothing really wrong with it just not something that we loved
3,finally a star wars addition which elevates its slower far less action driven yet more suspenseful as a result the characters have layers and complex motivations i especially love the weird mastersub relationship forming with the isb commander and her weird stalker who lives with his mother its full of odd details and threads this show also feels true to the core themes and style of the original trilogy in some ways its more effective we feel a strong sense of oppression ambiguous ethics dirty hands and meaningful formation of a rebellion its a refreshing change and a more mature star wars
3,heating issue battary issue fingerprint dont work
3,this dress has very pretty colors on the embroidery there is nothing wrong with the dress other than the fact that there is nothing special about it very blah fit the fabric feels very polyester no real shape to it the embroidery on the dress i tried was lined up like the photo so no problems there just nothing about the dress made me want to wear it perhaps at a much lower price point but at this price point its disappointing size fit perfectly and i am in general just
3,these muffins are moist but way too sweet other recipes i used require less sugar and no vanilla i tried this anyway and its more like a cupcake than muffin
3,this top is so cute but after i added my tank top under neath it made me look frumpy however if you pair it with the right tank and bottoms it could be very cute i think my problem is that i am not long wasted enough i wish that it had worked because it is so unique
3,i didnt know what to put for runs small true to size or runs large but it required me to put somethingi first ordered the xl and it was ridiculously gianormous the next time i ordered a large i thought the large would either be a perfect fit or still too large based on how the xl had fit the large was too tight i could not believe it it is too bad for i love the design and color of this top i ordered it in the muted red color if you can find a size that works for you go for
3,alan ritchson is just like reacher in all the reacher books i have read well cast dialog like the book physical presence like the book attitude like the book sorry tom but this casing is better long time reacher book fan
3,performance might be upgrade slightly if it done best lap under k
3,when you are lost in the darknesslook for the light thank god how happy i am that after all this waiting i can finally see this masterpiece and those memories come back to me when i was playing this game the story of last of us is a story that contains all kinds of emotions that makes the viewer and player fully immersed in the world they have created in the game and the drama throughout watching the series as well as the game i didnt take my eyes off it for a moment i didnt want to miss a moment i cant put into words what i want to say and i want to thank hbo neil drakeman gustavo santualala and the entire cast for this unique masterpiece and im already sure next year the series will win all the awards and write their names among the best series and i leave this comment to keep as a souvenir of good memories and whenever i get a notification i remember this masterpiece
3,i love everything about this sweater except the sizing i purchased the deep red in xs the yarn weight is perfect for me in los angeles the length is perfect the sleeves are bell shaped but not at all a problem for me theyre not so big that they get in my way at all unlike another reviewerthe collar can be folded in a way that it stands upright for a kind of retro look which i love the only problem is that the sweater is way too big i can handle a wide swingy style but with the sl
3,sound is very low i saw the first laptop with such a low volume
3,by far my favourite series even simple things like walking in the grocery store feel so different this dystopian thriller series will wrap its fingers around you and real you in its addictive and honestly i think this is the best show in the world may be because i am slightly in love with nick blaine but still doesnt take away from this beautiful production the change of characters from before and after gilead is so emotional the characterisation that takes place is truly astonishing all the characters are detailed so well you may love one at first but you will start to notice the change i love this show a dystopian thriller to the max
3,this top hit at my hips not as it appears on the model in the photo and i am short at cute top but shorter than i had expected and definitely not a tunic style
3,i understand the social importance of hollywood and am not knocking meaningful movies but not everything is a teaching moment sometimes a little escapism after a long day is enough this is fantastic as that rolling through all the great tropes prison fight check bar fight check and check local ruffian fight check and so on its done real well
3,so this is a gorgeous dress but it seems to have too many elements i wish they had left off the white lacy decoration at the neckline because it seems to make the dress more girly than sleek i am short so perhaps the multiple design features would be better on a tall woman than on me
3,i stalked this blouse and when the price dropped i pounced on the black sadly it did nothing for me im a large sometimes medium but decided on the large youd think it came with its own cami at this price but no completely sheer unwearable without one the lace is nothing special the collar is wider in the back uncomfortable and pulls on the lace in the front the highlow hem fit me oddly in the back im returning this one
3,i really liked the fabric and the design of this sweater but the sleeves hung at an odd length no way to push them up like on the model and the sweater was large on me i have broad shoulders but am otherwise petite unfortunately i had to return this glad others are having better luck
3,i got a samsung galaxy tab and i got this to increase memory i had hoped to transfer files from my macbook but it will not recognize the memory card i need to go to the apple genius bar to see if they can figure it out
3,high quality yummy soft fabric gorgeous color even with those three pros this jumpsuit is not for me i am and lbs size ml in the lines that retailer carries i own one of their jumpers and it is very flattering this one however has capri pants hits awkwardly at the midsection and makes my torso look even more square on a tall thin woman it probably works
3,it made me look extra thick in the middlecould pass for maternity wear pretty colors fabric is fine its just too shapeless and not flattering on me im and it was also on the short side for me even if it fit better probably too short for my age s
3,everything is good but display is tati
3,value of money
3,i ordered this top online in two colors and kept the berry color i liked it while trying it on when i wore it an entire day the top just didnt look that good it wasnt flattering and it focused on the bad areas despite being loose fitting it didnt seem very flattering i wore it for one day and am not happy with my purchase i wish i could send it back but i already wore it the fit just isnt very flattering it is loose but focuses on the curves not in a good way if you are curvy
3,enjoyed season i do however have a couple of problems with season i have read a lot of the books and found reacher to be a good guy with odd quirks he never stayed anywhere for long bought what he needed along the way etc but in this season he seems robotic hardly an emotion to be seen yes he fights has a relationship but all seem without any emotion whatsoever i dont expect any extreme emoting but nothing at all my second gripe is the violence just awful have to look away at some of it tone it down a bit less violence and more script and plotting these good stories you have a good product here dont blow it we dont want to be watching a call of duty game you can do better
3,i thought i might like the look of this oversized odette dress but after i tried it on i felt it was not a flattering style on me the color was pretty and fabric was nice just not a fit for me
3,this model is heated when it running
3,this shirt has beautiful coloring but the material wasnt as soft as i thought it would be i was hoping they would be the super soft material maybe washing them would help but i didnt want to chance it so i returned them
3,sorry but the recipe is wrong for those above sea level reason is not enough water which will evaporate the ratio should be cup of water to cups of flour per loaf of bread oil can be higher ratio the bread when it rises will create its own heat so if you have dry flower that is why change the ratio of water to flower for number of loafs
3,it is indeed cut to the shape of a trench however i think retailer should rename it as its more like wearing a cardigan its soft and pretty which i like however i wasnt convinced to buy it since i have a gazillion long black cardigans already made out of the same jersey stretch material
3,i wanted to love this dress because the color is so amazing but the arm holes are huge i am petite and tried this on and it just sadly didnt work
3,great show at times i dont know if its boring or exciting strangely mixed emotions but i still look and do not look away great actors
3,this sweater is beautiful especially in the bordeaux color the cable knit in varying directions makes it interesting and unique and the length is great for us short waisted ladies my big issue with this sweater is the sleeves there really are no sleeves just arm holes at the same level as the hem of the sweater so you feel as if you need to keep your arms pinned to your sides to keep from lifting the sweater up to expose your midsection or pushing the sleeves way up which then results in
3,bad battery lasts only hrs good display go for it if under k
3,season one themes crime drama family postwar gangs th century romance suspense action historical top three characters polly gray thomas shelby and arthur shelby
3,i stumbled upon this item at my local retailer and immediately had to true it on the colors are so lovely in person after trying it on i was disappointed the material has a foamyair feel to it and the skirt seems to run small needless to say i didnt purchase this item
3,i ll make it simple is amazing great story acting best show l watched in long time
3,this is the best laptop at this price i got it at k i u is the best and it beats ryzen u with big performance intel is doing a pretty good job with its processors build quality is ok cons but the worst thing about this laptop is the display its not antiglare its it will be the worst to not include anti glare i mean as a manufacturer it will literally cost you additional not more than rs for this display to include anti glareand you could have chang read more
3,the cinematography acting and dark comedy are on point here however these factors cannot overcome a piss poor plot and racist undertones the plot is so high level there isnt any room for character development and frankly who really cares when youre dealing with characters who are written to be despised double negative the viewer needs to care otherwise whats the point
3,ive made it with and without brown sugar and its much better without the sugar in my familys opinion
3,however sandisk replaced it and didnt charge for shipping so i guess ill wait and see how long this one lasts
3,this would be perfect if only it were lined i have a high waist and hourglass shape so jumpers are very hard to find that fit my body type this is a perfect fit for my body shape and when on it looks like a lovely dress however it is not lined and the material is very light and ivory so you see everything you cant wear a slip so that leaves the option of some sort of bodysuit if you dont want to show the world what you have i am very tired of all of the light colored clothing not bei
3,i am having some trouble with it in my cell phone motorola triumph music player has not been reliable since i loaded songs on it not sure if it is the card or my phone and it is not a consistent problem i need to try it on a few other devices
3,i have purchased many different styles of pilcro jeans and have loved them all these unfortunately i do not like i think they run large and the fit just blah the waist gapped and kinda had a mom jean look i felt the quality was also not up to standard for this brand
3,updated for season season started off weird it has a horrible soundtrack for one thing the choppy editing could be better however i think so far it might be the best of the it actually has characters that arent over the top annoying or caricatures you have people to like in this show to actually root for rather than against its far less political which makes it automatically times better than the other and at first it annoyed me that each episode ends with a whimper not a bangbut i actually prefer it now its just a pleasant show to wind down with walter goggins probably makes this season shine more as well after binging the second season and then the first for two days it seemed like you were watching two different series they just happened to have two of the same characters but other than that the pace intent and the point seemed different the second season had a more solid cast with pretty stellar performances by nearly everyone there seemed to be several messages unlike in the first season and while it did come off as preachy and pretentious not nearly as much as the first it also had a great mystery factor to it and was more of a tragic dramedy with enough comic relief that it wasnt too overly dramatic if not a bit unrealistic the first season suffered quite a bit after the first episode it didnt have as much humor after the first episode and didnt pull you in not a single character had any redeeming qualities and werent relatable at all using dialogue no one uses in real life ending up in situations that just dont happen im not sure what the point of it or the meaning of it was if there was one it was mostly pouty people who were either rich or poor but snobs either way people have more nuance than this and im not sure what demographic hbo is reaching out to with this tripe but its not for the majority of the worldwide population the second season would make me want to watch a rd and if you havent seen the first you could just skip straight to the nd without missing a beat
3,its a good
3,loved the color loved the scallops wish i loved it on me the poplin fabric is very structured which doesnt lend to a nice drape the bottom hem was a little small for my curvy hips so the top rode up a bit on me looks lovely on a straighter figure but wasnt amazing for me
3,jenna ortega is fantastic in the role god bless the casting manager everything of her acting is perfect and after a long time tim burton has coming back to his best comedy mystery and suspence are perfectly mixed in the show that is one of the best ive seen in this i enjoyed very much the viewing and i highly recommend it is too much fun and enjoyable eight episodes of nice entertainment well acted and well directed that is something that every series should offer to the public more a long long movie focused on the sinister addams familys girl than a serial tv im in love with this and hope for a second season
3,if you have any curves at all then this will look like a sack on you i wanted to love it because of the material and ive been looking for a blazer jacket that was heavy in weight this just looked awful on me maybe for someone who is very slender this will work but i was highly disappointed in the cut
3,it is one of the serials that are started without expectations to fill free time but watched and finished in a single breath it both took us back to our childhood and ended the season leaving a good taste in our mouths and the tim burton signature already makes it one click ahead of other series the series is a classic tim burton piece it has become a watchable series with a cool character network that does not tire the subject which is enjoyable to watch of course there will be those who criticize but the fact that even a garbage producer like netflix could not spoil it shows how high quality the story is i liked the lead character very much i dont know if i internalized it because i found inspirations from myself but the story drew me in a lot i hope it continues
3,the laptop heats up when i work too little
3,i ordered sizes to try for in store pickup both were too large so size down i am lbs and the s was too large in the neck and body even though i generally wear things large also the collar was a hemmed flat collar not the roll collar depicted i reviewed that with the salesperson as well we were both at a loss to explain why and the tiger embellishments were more orange yellow and glittery on the ones i ordered
3,i wanted to love this shirt i like the style the material is soft but it was so short on me perhaps i just have a long torso but it fit everywhere else i wasnt even able to tuck it in because the sides just were so short
3,i would give it a if half star possible like other reviews said the material is a little cheap and back zip got stuck when i tried to unzip it before trying it on overall nice color and flattering look that could be dress up or down i am lbs b and m is a little snug for me on the top
3,this was just ok to us
3,the fabric is really itchy i felt like i was wearing a carpet and it reminded me of the s fabric crimplene this will not be comfy in humid weather the top also had a strange synthetic odorit was returned
3,keyboard is very poor otherwise laptop is good
3,i love the unusual print but the cut didnt work for me ive got a round back side and a sway back and the dress made me look twice as big front to back than i actually am because theres no shaping to help it adjust to the curves so sad
3,loved the idea of this topbut it just wont work for me its really big im and lbs a small should be fine but im swimming in this the back is pretty i tried it on with a white cami but it looks very maternity on me tried to order the xs but its sold out too bad was a cute idea not too thin for summer
3,i just loved this when i saw it in store beautiful fabric lovely color i ordered a small petite because petite xs was sold out i imagine it might be a little better if it were a size smaller but there is sooo much fabric in the pleated bottom unless you are blessed with exceptionally long legs it might end up looking like a witches coat at least that is what i was told by my daughter
3,i ordered this in black and red i had high hopes based on the reviews this received but its just ok i will be returning
3,normal design performance is good battery drains very fastgb only ssd so plan your purchase accordingly
3,i wish i would have read the other reviews before ordering its cute but very casual and very thin materialnot like other retailer tops also runs super small i ordered a small i wear a small or xsmall at retailer and will likely jump to a large given feedback in other reviews
3,i have read all of lees books in the jack reacher series and this show honored them i am very much looking forward to season two please dont tell me that this series has ended if so i will read the books again
3,runs a little small in the shouldersbust
3,thoroughly enjoyed season so i was excited for season from the very first episode it was obvious that something was wrong reacher looked dirty and his face was puffy like an alcoholic the producers found living in a ditch reacher is supposed to be a straight arrow with an innate sense of right and wrong not some scruffy looking bruiser looking for a fight the above was just his appearancelets get into the dialogue its stilted unconvincing and painfully repetitive you dont mess with details matter if we dont kill them all etc also worthy of note is what theyve done to reachers very character hes portrayed in the books as a one man righter of wrongs as he was portrayed in season so why does season have him in an ensemble this is not where his strength lies and finally we get it all reacher owns is a toothbrush and the clothes on his back but watching him repeatedly by clothing is about as exciting as watching a kitten play with an ipad lets hope season gets him washed up dried out and back in a small town where he dominates the locals the way its supposed to be
3,this is a pretty jump suit true to size looked flattering on me lovely soft tencel like fabric and pretty design fabric however the sides are cut too deep and its impossible to wear a strapless bra or any kind of bra without the bra showing i tried without one and that definitely doesnt work so back it went to the store
3,i really wanted to like this dress and was encouraged by the positive reviews the dress itself was very comfortable but was very unflattering the top fabric hit my ribs funny and made me look really wide
3,i love this shirt in fact i love all bordeaux tops from retailer i followed the instructions to hand wash only and after it was wet and then lay flat to dry it may fit a child it is a belly top i want to love this but it shrunk so bad even with the hand wash only instructions
3,i thought this top had shimmery dots that is what it looks like in the picture but when it arrived it looks much plainer inperson and i could not believe it was this top the dots are polka dots the embroidery at the vneck doesnt stand out much in the photo but it does inperson the top runs true to size but the fit didnt feel as perfect for me i am sending it back i needed a more shimmery top
3,i tried this top in xs in store i loved the macrame detail and quality of fabric it billowed out too much below the chest and looked tent like my daughter laughed when she saw me in it so did i i didnt buy it im
3,i found both colors and jumped on this shirt then i got it home and realized that it was pretty much useless there is no way to put a sweater or jacket over it it is too hot to wear in the summer putting a tee under ruins the look i am very flat chested so it hung well but there is lots of shirt both went back in exchange for two wearable items
3,i loved everything about this show except grace the character was not at all believable and the actress cannot sing worth a damn her tuneless squalling made me cringe poorly cast
3,this dress looks so elegant and perfect for transition from work to night it looks great on the model but it looked terrible on my its a lovely material but the middle added girth to my stomach area which i did not care for
3,this jumpsuit is lovely and comfortable with gorgeous embroidered detailing but it really needs to come in petite sizes at with a pretty proportional torso to leg ratio i found the hem length okay but the top portion way too long for the waistband to be anywhere near my natural waist the shoulders would have had to be taken up several inches and the armholes shortened
3,failed after one month and the problem is epidemic on the sandisk forums they slowly get corrupted then fail and report only mb sizethe lifetime warranty is nice but these products are clearly defective im in the process of rma now will update post on status updatesdo not trust your data with this product keep a backup of everything you put on it im serious just look at the sandisk users forum for gb cardshere is my breakdown while it lastedsandisk ultra gb microsdxc class uhswrite speed was mbs usually tested windows usb reader and androidread speed mbsfailed monthsupdate received back replacement item in brand new condition readspeed is mbs write speed is still around mbs rma turn around time was about weeks i will up rating if this one lasts longer then one monthupdate rma replacement is still going strong upped the star rating by one point
3,it heats up even with running simple apps battery drains up quickly however processor is fast design looks good
3,based on previous reviews i sized up to size i typically wear xs or s while the length was okay the body was way too wide the neck was almost like a mock neck higher than i expected which made it very uncomfortable for me overall i didnt find it flattering or anything special
3,the tee is adorable in the floral print the fit is true to size as it is a casual tee rather than overly fitted the cuffed sleeves are a nice detail i would have bought this at full price but it is quite see through in the whiteyellow floral i could easily see my nude colored bra and even my belly button it was so sheer having to wear a tank underneath this completely defeats the purpose of a cute casual tee you can just throw on i was so disappointed that it was so sheer i think the
3,i am baking these banana bars now i used a x x inch pan as directed jelly roll size the batter is overflowing into the bottom of my oven did anyone else have that problem
3,the first season of the show gets a nine from me its tight consistent darkly humorous and its social commentary is nuanced and central to the show season two gets more like a six its good enough for me to watch a season three but overall season two is less interesting because it feels more like a slow moving trainwreck of a tabloid story the writing is just too obvious and lacks the nuance necessary to make the excesses interesting or meaningful that doesnt make it bad television but it does move it to the maybe category of recommendations for me except for aubrey plazas performance she is excellent and definitely worth showing up for overall the show is engaging and has plenty to say if they can move past the sophomore slump of overly obvious excess id love to see more seasons
3,this is a great speed cardmore than mbsec works perfect on my android device samsung galaxy sii gti also works perfect using cyanongenmod the only downside the price is an expensive cardi use it for music playback like poweramp spotify and rdio works flawless
3,given the price i was pretty disappointed by the quality of the fabric the dress falls nicely and fits well but the fabric is cheap i have another maxi dress that i bought for like bucks at store on the boardwalk and it has the same fit and fabric i expect a lot more from a dress with this price id recommend only buying on supersale
3,it was a hard decision but im returning these theyre definitely pretty and wellmade they drape nicely ultimately they are too highwaisted and too billowy for most of my tops which are mostly long and billowy these trousers are too nice to wear with most of my fitted tanks even a normallength tshirt untucked draped weirdly and came down too far on these highwaisted pants i guess theyre too formal for what i had in mind pictured them more like a maxi skirt if they were hal
3,i love this top and the beading is beautiful but just like everyone else it was way too large i normally wear a lg but the large looks and feels like a xl beautiful but large
3,its a perfectly cute simple summer dress but the only reason im even considering keeping it is because it was a gift the material is fine but for this price i expect something more exciting than what is really just a modified tshirt dress at least more exciting colors or a print or something the top piece is full layers which could get warm in the summer and the ribbing is tight enough that you have to wear a bra even if youre smallchested im a b and super thin and still neede
3,like others reviewers mentioned on here this dress is extremely well made but there were too many cons for me as well this would most certainly work on a petiteshorter frame but for tall busty and curvier girls it just sits wrong on all places unfortunately the color is lovely along with the nice collar that ties in the back really made this dress stand out however im a c and found that the armshoulder part so large and bulky that is made me look bigger on top there was entirel
3,simple ideas interesting characters and fantastic casting and performances its a fresh show different than what youre used to the show has a way of showing you both sides of an argument its a show you can watch with friends and have fun with it will stay with you days after reminds me of the show fargo in some ways just watch it and let it evolve i wouldnt watch it with your kids or grandma because there will be some inappropriate scenes when you least expect them but overall its a show that doesnt follow any cookie cut story rules you are probably used to just watch it trust a stranger on the internet
3,great show really feels like star wars again set design costumes and use of practical effects are all quite well done casting is very good with pedro pascal giancarlo esposito and gina carano standing out although the addition of rosario dawson is a really poor choice she has none of the personality of the character shes portraying and her entire time onscreen is just grating everyone else performs adequately or better it goes through an interesting and satisfying overarching plot for the season with each episode featuring its own selfcontained plot while some episodes can be a little weak they are almost all great fun
3,love this show perfect adaptation this will be enjoyable for all to watch compared to the movies this is how jack reacher is supposed to be viewed action was perfect as well as the suspense
3,i havent read any witcher books or played any video games so im reviewing this just as tv the first series introduced some great characters and each episode stood alone as a fun adventure as well as developing the longer personal stories of the main characters the second series really lost its way with seemingly random travel from crisis to crisis driven by a vague destiny or unrelatable politics i couldnt really tell you the plot and i finished it yesterday they shouldve kept it more personal and left all that in the background because its not compelling enough to be the focus i hope there is more and it finds its footing again because its about ready to collapse under its own weight
3,brilliant pacing and character integrity wonderful acting with authentic beautiful cinematic visuals enough familiarity and difference to engage the desire for more the music is subtle and meaningful and enhances the atmosphere and real life world building you dont need to have played the games to be swept into caring about these people and their story i was invested immediately feeling drawn to the genuine and believable portrayals visuals and set pieces if this doesnt drive the game back to the top of the charts i dont know what will congrats to all didnt think i was too much of a fanboy but alas it seems i am
3,very nice fabric but disappointed in the stitching on the knees it looks nice but makes the pants very uncomfortable and tight around the knees too bad because i love the style and hoped they would work
3,andor were again exploring the time span between movies fortunately unlike with obiwan andor seems to be heading somewhere in this show were seeing how the rebellion began and i got to say that im amazed the rebellion ever got anything done seeing its own members are more in it for their own personal reasons than for the liberation of the galaxy from the rule of the empire cassian andor is an interesting character but he isnt that interesting if the show was carried only by him then we would have another flop on our hands fortunately weve luthen rael stellan skarsgård and mon mothma genevieve oreilly giving the show more than cassian can offer although not exactly playing by the same rules rael and mothma are clearly crucial pieces of hopefully will become a far more efficient rebellion than the one shown thus far the inner dynamics of the agents of the empire are also very interesting to observe seeing that they show that the empire only sustained their grip on the galaxy because of certain key individuals without them vader and sidious wouldnt matter for the empire wouldve fallen even to a very inefficient rebellion the best imperial characters thus far are dedra meero and major partagaz all the other imperial characters are mainly to give contrast to those two characters andor has enough room to become better and if it does ill increase the score i gave it but if it does not then ill have no problem stop seeing it andor so far is only interesting and worth watching because it has lots of potential if the show will live to that potential thats another matter altogether
3,after watching the show i can understand and appreciate why the critics are divided on this one the writing is generally good but inconsistent the storytelling varies from fascinating to convoluted characters often behave in nonsensical ways several the details of the plots are rushed or glossed over which can add a feeling of contrivance the timejumps can be confusing at first although it is unavoidable given the season was based on collection short stories the world building while groundbreaking by the standards videogamers are used to is rather simplistic compared to the giants of fantasy literature but whatever flaws it has is redeemed by excellent production values endearing and outstanding performances by the cast and the fascinating central premise of the mutantmonsterhunterinvestigator henry cavill has permanently become geralt of rivia if being superman was not enough this performance should ensure that cavill remain an enduring beloved icon among the nerds veterans like burring or may are as good as one could hope anya chalotra however is the breakout star much like her character she displayed charisma ease and nuance worthy of someone well beyond her years it is pretty ironic given a smallminded subset of the fanbase tried to get her removed from the cast because of imaginary skintone mismatch while the overarching plot is good enough to be invested in it is the monsterhunter bits that i found most fascinating there is a lot of potential there for mixing elements of folklore fantasy horror and mystery in the vein of classics like xfiles and for some philosophical musings about the definition of a monster i would love to see a few selfcontained episodes each season dedicated to the monster hunting ultimately it is a question of whether one would like to see more of this show just as it is i most certainly do with the evident success of this season i am sure the showrunners will be more confident at telling their story at a more consistent pace introduce more popular faces and do even better
3,the dress had great potential but the top sagged and made the dress look unflattering on me unfortunately i had to return it the length was great and the back and sides of the dress were nicely tailored and flattering perhaps this would fit someone else better i have a bc bust and it didnt work for me
3,when these shorts arrived i loved them and was so excited to wear them on my upcoming trip to the beach the high rise waist is very flattering and the material was extremely soft the floral detailing was a little more orange than in the picture but i still loved the contrast the first time i wore these i immediately noticed threads coming loose throughout the day it was minor but still concerning for an item that was so costly the real problem arose in the evening when i put on a jacket on
3,this is a very pretty shirt which is too narrow across the back i need to be able to move my arms freely at work so this did not work for me you may be able to size up for a better fit if moving your arms is important to you
3,i was hopeful after season that the writers and the author will find their way unfortunately that hasnt come out its sad when a trailer for the witcher game makes me more excited then the season and combined the show should be terminated in my view and netflix should be focusing on new material im hopeful that in near future new author will attempt to create the show again as the source material is great its sad that show rights were not given to hbo as i believe they would make it more accurate i also hope that political corrections will soon become history and be removed from creative writing the show should have followed the slavic origins and have selected actors according
3,simple cotton garment such that the price seems high if it had fit perfectly there is a chance i would have kept the dress but my normal size was a bit large and even though it was size petite also to long in the upper body perhaps a p would have fit but it may have then been too small puzzling for petite to be too long in upper body love this shape dress and the color and pattern however
3,strangely enough this goof describes the downfall of the series perfectly season stars simply amazing beyond expectations season stars very good with many lovely story telling season what the hell was that in one of the latest episodes of season yennefer says look at all these gold left here to rust yennefer is a powerful sorcerer that has lived for centuries and has extensive knowledge in alchemy she would most definitely know that gold does not rust thats what makes it so special and that summarize the quality of the rd season and how once an amazing show with beautiful story wide characters and extended knowledge has now become a total waste of time
3,this top is beautiful to look at but did not fit me like the model it was tight across the bust but very poofy at the bottom which normally i like but not this time sad
3,great series great homage to the original star wars universe great sfx
3,battery is not expected sometimes automatically switch off due to heating dont know why battery heat very soon
3,the cover didnt capture my interest however hbo has done a great job promoting this show it kept popping up on my facebook feed finally after many months of being exposed to commercials i decided to give it a go i dont want to spoil anything and i wont but ive rarely been so invested in a tv show i watched every episode with my wife and we usually dont watch anything together as we have different taste the writing and the acting is up and above the story is very captivating the true hero however is offred june she doesnt kick ass like wonder woman but she is the toughest and one of the most inspiring characters i have ever witnessed no matter what dimension of hell she is dragged through she keeps holding on to hope and fight to keep her sanity she doesnt have any super powers and no she doesnt pack a heavy punch nor is she indestructible but ill be damned if christ himself could carry her pain for day and not bail on his sacrifice june is a badass
3,keyboard light is too much pretty value for money
3,way too much liquid for the topping turned out mushy and too sweet i would try it again using half the topping
3,it was a little too creamy for me
3,this sounds good but way too many fat calories from the cheese
3,nice color and great work but runs little large
3,battery performance soo bad
3,this is not a review per se but a question to those bakers that have made this bread when i eat it the first day it is made its very good however it gets terribly dry after the first cuts and then it just does not taste as flavorful as that first slice within a day or so after being made it is dry and very sad tasting does anyone else have this same thing happen i love the the easiness of this recipe and hope there are some suggestions on how i might get the moist taste you get from some of the store bought white breads
3,product quantity is goodit is basically th generation laptop from the company delli have previously used dell laptopit is a good brand by performance and efficient
3,i am typically a small at retailer but always order a small and medium to try since im tall the color of the green is really pretty and i can see wearing it on the weekend with casual sandals and dressing it up with a cropped jacket for work the sizing is way off on this dress though the small is too short for me personally im and the waist doesnt sit low enough for a dropwaisted style so i tried a medium the medium is not sized correctly at all i tried it on and it fits si
3,i love the pattern and style of the dress but unfortunately its doesnt fit quite right the top is too loose the clip doesnt work well and the waist line of the dress sit above the waist and the sleeves are tight which is shocking to me because i have skinny arms
3,i dont know the books i dont know the game i went into this clueless ok it was henry cavill who wouldnt i admit it wasnt until the third episode that i slowly understood the story thats because of the flashbacks which i didnt know were flashbacks or the backstory the first two episodes were confusing and a tad boring i actually nodded off then i decided to go for the third episode and thats when i actually got interested now im bummed that its only episodes and season is rumored to be released in like with new seasons of all netflix series that means i would have to rewatch the last few episodes or the whole season to remind me of where they left off before starting season which in this case would even be a longer wait overall i like it but it doesnt fill the void of got amazon prime has carnival row hbo also has his dark materials but sorry theyre just not got
3,i bought this on sale thinking it was a great deal but when it came in i found it to fit like a totally unflattering sack the pattern didnt help anything looking totally faded and washed outthe fabric and overall quality is nice but the fit and pattern are just sougly unfortunately had to return it
3,first one i received was ripping apart already in the sleeve opening at wrist warning very tight sleeves plus of the green shiny band detail was missed altogether by whomever sewed this particular one just left unstitched and long threads were hanging in several places this is by no means a quality piece and is severely overpriced on the positive side it is very cute and im keeping the replacement one but know that it is also delicate after one use there is a snag on the inside
3,not for petite women you need to have a long figure for this tunic to drape like it does on the model if it ever goes on sale i will purchase it but not worth the full price for me at the moment
3,not that much premium than its cost during the sale we got from kits too much and its not latest year old product approximately k is enough for gb ram and rtx
3,just keep charged all the timebattery dropped in seconds from n percnever seen with any laptop before
3,build quality is bad
3,i really was looking forward to this piece but unfortunately it was too small to even pass through my head nevertheless i couldnt even get both arms in i got a size small and probably needed a large but as far as the quality and color its really pretty just go up a size or two if anything and try it out
3,this was pretty good but not a favorite as far as mexican lasagnas go my family likes the other one i make better
3,i liked the idea of the diagonal color block but the fit of this tee was odd on me too tight around arms and way big and boxy around the midsection going back
3,when i tried it on it looked like a stiff bathrobe straight too boxy
3,the witcher is much better than the wheel of time but it has the same flaw found in both adaptations its obvious that when media giants like netflix and amazon buy the tv rights to a major book series all they are really interested in is the concept the major characters and the fictional world everything else they treat like a rough first draft of a script that can be changed altered or transformed into something that suits their purposes the wheel of time was changed beyond all recognition while at least the witcher retains much of the original story but i will never forgive the showrunner for what she did to eskil and the laying of the blame for that upon ciri congratulations you just infuriated the over million people who bought the game containing eskil and ciris story its understandable how the tolkien estate guards his legacy so fiercely from the attention of big media companies im only continuing with this series because i like the lead characters so much to everyone who finds the story difficult to follow and the timeline all over the place thats exactly how the books were written so at least theyve retained that much from them
3,billowy top perfect for casual comfort the topic is definitely not raspberry it is a sunset orange disappointed as i was going for a match i should have gone off of the picture and not the color name
3,i thought lost even with its crap ending was the best show this millennium so far but reacher kicks it out of the way like a punch in the face from reacher there is never a dull moment it explains everything it keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat and also manages to make you laugh no woke agenda here just good old rambo style usa ass kicking tough guy the new walker could learn a lot from reacher
3,the dress is too big i got size after checking the measurements chart for reference lb it is too wide not as fitted as in the picture the cut is too deep might work better for a bustier lady but looks pathetic on me the pattern is too bright much brighter that in the picture i got red pattern its not that the photos represent the colors inaccurately its just the colors are much more vibrant in real life the material is heavier than i expected
3,i thought that it looked like it belonged on a yearold i can almost see why they styled the model in what looks like ankle socksready for cheerleading for reference it fits true to size but is very short i am and tried on a regular small it was at least inches above my knee
3,im a size jeans with a bubble bottom these were falling off of me around the hips these are warm i was expecting them to not be sheer since they are fleece lined but when i sat down i was shocked to notice it it doesnt matter functionality wise because i never felt a draft they look good and are well made but i will be returning due to the lack of fit
3,screen size is small not according to configurationbut corner to corner it is inch
3,this top has nice quality lace but the layout is strange it wouldnt stay under my boobs but kept creeping up and looked strange not for girls with a chest
3,i thought the quality of the fabric was good and liked the idea of wearing it either with opening in front or back it was a little larger then i was expecting and i wish it had a closure hook and eye or snap at the top it has three places in the back to tie together and when i tied them in a bow they came loose easily overall glad i bought it
3,alan ritchson is great as reacher i was not a fan of the movies i never bought tom cruise as the titular character ritchson does a better job much better tbh these shows especially the american ones are usually predictable and not requiring a lot of brain work as an audience member but this one is better than most and im looking forward to a second season
3,machine is too slow from the beginning month itself i wonder if the machine is refurbished and not a new one
3,good laptop
3,yummy soft material but very faded looking so much so that i am sending it back if a faded look is something you like then this is for you
3,overall a really nice top that is soft and comfortable the arm length hits nicely on the forearm and the decorative detail at top is wellconstructed didnt keep this since the top made me look quite big in my bust to the point of not being flattering top is also a bit boxy so id stay away if you are petite with a larger bust unless you are okay with that emphasis
3,this teenage vision of the show doesnt work for me i wanted to see aclassic tim burtons dark tale but it feels like a mix between smallville and the last encarnation of sabrina but happier i desagree about the general view related to jenna ortegas preformancein some scenes her acting looks like out of character and both luis guzmán and catherine zetajones dont deliever in the bright side emma myers christina ricci and fred armisen are by far the best preformancesof the show the show is funny perhaps to many episodes it could be shorter and the final big bad boss was pointless and boring
3,after week used review performance is good star battery backup very very poor to hour max to max just watch movie or normal web search when i used heavy vfx work battery backup to hour only battery backup minus star
3,im not much for ponchos but this one looked unique it is thin kind of a felt material that was expected but i was surprised to find it was shorter at waist than how it appears online and it was wide horizontally the colors were more muted and the design was slightly off center unlike pic the turtleneck was thick and itchy it was a return
3,beautiful dress with the colors and pleats i did not have the same problems with the bust area that others did my biggest complaint is the exposed zipper doesnt lay flat even when just hanging on the hanger when actually on a person the zipper juts out had to be returned
3,this dress is everything i hoped it would bebright colorful quality jacquard classic silhouette unfortunately it runs small up top on the bust and i couldnt even zip it up all the way returning
3,this is one of my favorite flavours of pot noodle but i have gone off it a little recently there are far better foods out there but the pure convenience of a pot noodle cannot be denied
3,jack reacher is a physically powerful former military investigator caught up in a murder inquiry that may have broad sweeping as well as personal implications reacher is often brutal but succeeds as a fun and occasionally charming action thriller the core characters are played well and fleshed out just enough to win over the audience supporting characters dont have the same treatment and come across as onedimensional and dispensable the overall plot is reasonably simple although the twists and turns complicated things for the viewer to be honest i mostly just trusted the characters would eventually explain whats going on and enjoyed the ride
3,this dress is beautiful very vibrant and rich lookinghowever after wearing it to work the back of the dress was completely stretched out from sitting in my office chair when i stood up a little bubble remained around my butt not attractive i wanted to love it but its going back
3,for the first time i bought this ice cream as the reviews are so goodand try it to be honest itus not that bad but not amazing the vanilla yogurt from alpro is way better my kids enjoyed but for me need to have more vanilla flavour my husband smelled and says smell like a big blop of cream
3,i guess a lot of viewers expecting the show to be focused on the adventures of the witcher not as expected good show though i hope second season will be better
3,the product is good according to price but display is huge minus remaining it is a good product
3,at first i was interested i liked the color the soft tencel fabric the cut in the back it was all good they didnt have my size in the store so i had to order it when it arrived in the mail it was folded up and wrinkled i tried it on and it looked like a lifeless unstructured blazer i sent it back all in all it is cute and fun for warm weather it is definitely a casual blazer id probably wait for a sale on this one it does run tts
3,way to slow especially when we have to see the horror happens with junes face the actress is like an alient trying to mimic human expressions it looks dumb and out of place everyone else does a better job though good story but they dont have any progress after the first season so we spent hours feels like years to watch june looking confused and stupid
3,i was just wondering what would happen as another lady thought it was too much i am going to try this recepie anyway
3,incredibly booooring wow wow how could anybody like this stars stars for this what i just cant imagine anybody wanting to watch a series with characters that overreacts and gets hung over by such trivial problems theres no drama or what so ever the first character which you are supposed to be empathetic about turns out to be an unlikable person right out of the gate the whole plot is just flat for three consecutive episodes
3,i am lbs petite frame i bought this dress in xxsp the fabric was good quality and thicker than i have imagined good for fall maybe a little warm for the hot humid summer days but perhaps a cooler summer day unfortunately this dress runs pretty large much too large for my petite frame so i had to return it i would recommend sizing down this dress is very beautiful and would be great to wear to work or out for after work drinks also maybe a bridal shower or other brunch event
3,cant hollywood keep to the winning script when making new material based on beloved characters if they dont like the original they can make their own thing but then dont steal name and major traits from something original and great wednesday should be dark but with sparkle this one is more mainstream brat it was easy to see that something was truly wrong in the first episode the casting of pugsley and gomez shows that this is going to be bad really bad old series and movies were great because they had an connection with the viewers sometimes the materiale will not age well and therfore not fit into todays scene trying to reinvent it to suit todays marked while still selling it to the people who liked the original is in most cases a looseloose scenario wednesday is the latter if you like the addams family skip wednesday nothing to see here except bad casting bad script lack of imagination and a tv and movie industry in free fall
3,i love the pattern of the redorange dress i bought this online for easter im bummed i felt frumpy the dress fit im athletic build and i bought the xs it is just not flattering on my frame i looked like i had big hips the waist band was not creating a waist for me and i need that i wanted to keep it but sadly i will be returning it my husband agreed i should return it
3,the details on this dress are lovely the embroidery is wonderful but the fit on this dress is just not for me it is very baggy and shapeless it doesnt have any curves at all so it just drapes down me and looks formless really unflattering sad but its going back
3,interesting and one of the best series i have i like it so mutch
3,we bought this for our new born and loved it especially the breathing function where its chest raises and lowers methodically unfortunately after only a couple of months we have been disappointed to find this function is no longer working
3,this shirt is such a pretty color i was so excited to get it however i felt like the fit was not flattering it sort of just hung on me didnt do much for me i actually ended up returning it
3,system is hot after half an hour use
3,pretty tee but not worth the price lace is beautiful but fit is blah
3,a complete lack of understanding of the books that were so eagerly referred to before the premiere someone made a list of events from the book and they threw them into the script without understanding the events it all makes no sense in addition the changes from the previous season do not match what they want to show nothing is explained this is not a witcher but a series created by the authors from scratch a very weak series the characters have a different character than in the books the events are mixed up from different volumes and their content is completely changed its terrible
3,i hated the first episode until the last minutes i fast forwarded through all the ciri scenes in the second episode honestly i almost gave up on the show it picks up dramatically from the third episode onward the ciri scenes can be a little slow but everything fleshes out from that point on and by the last scene of the last episode i was completely engrossed and i cant wait for the next season highly recommend but just go into it knowing that it takes some time to gain momentum
3,the only disappointment was that it has only episodes it was entertaining with very nice insertions of the folklore
3,i so wanted to love this suit it is so unique and cute however it does not wear well on a short girl i am and the torso was much too short for me so the cut down the middle looked really wide and odd and the suit just made me look stumpy instead of sexy also for how expensive this suit it i also thought the material was pretty thin for how expensive this suit is im sad to say it is going back
3,high price and quantity low
3,this top was really cute on someone else but not on me on me ti was too big and the color washed me out the fabric is nice and the pattern and colors are nice too just not on porcelain skin like many tops this season it is a bit boxy but looks nice with jeans white shorts or halftucked into a skirt i would probably size down a bot
3,since we have been looking for a great music box for a long time and overwhelmed the positive reviews i also ordered the otter when this came on we had to find out that the supplied batteries were empty if you dont have any in the house then you cant even test it that was the first minus point the second and then i have to connect to the negative reviews that the engine is simply too loud when lifting the belly and lowering it its also a disturbing noise also the white noise which is supposed to represent the bloodstream in the womb sounds rather like a radio station that has no reception for me personally it doesnt seem calming and my child does not have a calmer effect rather the opposite was the result the other sounds such as heart tones and ctg are not bad but for us not useful as we had to find out the third minus point goes to the soundleiser controller of course if its about minutes but i think that its even quieter my opinion is not too cute but its also nice to say its quiet in the big room
3,season starts off strong but can get confusing to those with poor attention spans i advise you watch season twice or at the very least pay attention when youre watching it gets better and better each episode i love the twists and setups for season cavill is a perfect geralt and he makes me feel as if i never stopped playing the video game for fans of the series the witcher is a must watch
3,initially i bought this because i liked the color and style of this trench coat i thought it could look very chic and polished the problem was it was too large and too wrinkly im lbs and ordered an xs because petite sizes were unavailable but i realize that a petite xs wouldve been a better fit also the sleeves were too long even with an xs ive already returned the product
3,i was looking forward to this cute top to get me through the winter but the combination of the very think fabric and boxy shape did not work on my lb d figure the one i received also had an open unfinished seam beneath the zipper i imagine this would be a great top for someone taller
3,ive read and loved all the books i even liked the movies but this series blew me away reacher was perfect the cast and writing were strong cant wait for the second series i hope theres one for every book longer next time though i was so disappointed when this one ended although i suppose thatll teach me to watch the series in two days would have been one day but i started too late yesterday
3,great jeans by pilcro too short and snug around my knees for keeping though
3,ive been using this daily the product lathers up nicely with a little water and the bottle is a good size so itll last a long time i found it quite drying on my skin compared to other facial washes ive used and i dont think even the smell was refreshing to me which was a little disappointing this review was collected as part of a promotion
3,im tall and busty and found this top to run on the short side as others have said the material is soft and stretchy but the rouching created a bit of a bulky look i returned it
3,this t is a beautiful color and i wish it had worked it is quite flimsy however very thin cotton fabric without the nice drape that would have made this look good on i also think it should have been cut a little longer it flares out right at the hipsso instead of covering them it highlights them im disappointed and am returning it
3,the product is great and value for money under budget segment
3,i wanted to love this jacket so soft and great color unfortunately it is just too light weight it is almost like shirt fabric nice heft to the fabric though nice length accept the sleeves were short on me i am and lbs the small was the right size i was looking for something slightly warmer to layer
3,ms office not in free
3,the laptop looks premium the design and handling is great lid opening is smooth full hd display is excellent it is buttery smooth and it is very fast to operate it comes with original inbuilt msoffice student version excel word ppt with lifetime validity which you wont be getting in its competitor range laptop pros premium looks good build quality and finish there is no lag so far multitasking and gaming is smooth and fastboots up in a lightning speed thanks to ss read more
3,i agree with a previous review too much flourthe dish is very tasty but i found the cheese sauce too heavy will make again but decrease the flour to make a thinner consistency
3,wanted to love this love rompers but the opening between your chest was oddly designed it was gapping and certainly couldnt bend over without showing lots fabric seemed heavy for the summer all in all it was too full made me feel frumpy
3,i agree with the other reviewer who stated this sweater is very s online it looks minorly fluffy with muted colors but in person its a bad overlyfuzzy christmas sweater with super bright s colors if youre going for kitschy tacky retro this may work for you but if you are looking for the sweater in the photo youll be disappointed it looked to be true to size but to be honest i hated it so much i didnt even try it on
3,whoever was involved in the directing writing and producing of this series should have been the go to for the last three star wars movies its awesome just watch it for yourself and you be the judge
3,this recipe was delicious i will make this again but will definitely increase the baking time i baked for approximately minutes and the bars in the center of pan were gooey and underbaked i made them for a potluck and i could not serve the bars in the center they were a gooey mess
3,i am a film and game buff so usually i am not into tv shows unless they are adaptations or thematic remakes as an avid player of the games i assumed i would dislike the show for the changes made but i was pleasantly suprised some main plot elements are different from the games and after comparing them i can assume it is to add screen time and add depth to some characters that were untouched in the games as an adaptation i appreciate the filmmakers making changes because i wouldnt want to watch all the tlou cutscenes again there are some strange post production cut decisions and inconsistencies that i noticed but other than that i appreciate what they are doing with the show
3,ordered this vest in both the xs and pxs i liked the length and overall fit of the xs however i ended up returning both due to how the vest draped the outer fabric is a bit more stiff which made the vest balloon out more then what i liked overall its not a terrible vest but just not for me
3,loved that this was an boiled wool dress but unfortunately runs very large i tried the small and extra small both were really large in the hips i will maybe try the xxs was hoping to make this is winter staple
3,the blouse looked better on the model i liked the way it fit just not how it looks the fabric made me itch which was one of the other reasons i returned it i wished it had looked good and the fabric didnt make me itch i really liked the unique look to the shirt
3,i cant quite put my finger on why this wasnt my favorite but i think i would skip the worcestershire sauce and ketchup and just make a beef broth type gravy to mix in and also i would probably omit the peas or put in fewer and add in some carrots it wasnt bad but not something i would make again unless i adjusted it more to my tastes
3,i really want to like this series but it doesnt feel like it takes place in a star wars universe other than appearances by stormtroopers and a tie fighter season is more action packed right from the start which makes it better than season the glaring issue is mainly that it can easily blend in with any scifi series about the future human race living on other planets in our galaxy its another series that fails to make you feel like youre in a galaxy far far away there are many lost opportunities to use aliens and invent entertainment music that feel out of this world what it turns out to be are more and more humans at every planet they visit in costumes that feel more earthly than alien and they gave in to using techno music that you would hear at any rave ie the gimmicky music of the future this just feels like lack of budget to keep on pumping as many star wars series as they can through the pipeline of disney if you start to feel let down rewatch rogue one to remember that they have the ability to make a new show that feels like it actually took place in the star wars universe its sad that they have to keep on saying this new show feels like the most star wars show ever made to try and keep people watching
3,i loved this top when i wore it it draped beautifully i always snatch up all of bordeaux tshirts because of the way they hang but beware you must dry this flat ive always had no problem washing and drying their tshirts but this one shrunk up to half its size the first time i washed it and is no longer wearable it does say on tag lay flat to dry and they mean it
3,socialism has killed more than million people also has tortured and controlled every aspect of peoples live so they make a tv show to critic christianity its for people that like to really believe in tails
3,please be awate that although this blouse is beautiful and the color is gorgeousit is completely sheer it just doesnt match up with the price point
3,the recipe was good but did not have the flavor i was expectingi would push lemon juice on the fish first or would use a balsamic vinegar to marinate fish along with cilantro first then continue the recipe
3,i wanted so badly to love this sweater the colors in the blue motif are fabulous and the yarn is soft and warm but it does not fit me in a flattering way i cant recommend a size because the s and the m were exactly the same size and fit the neck is broad and bulky and overwhelming the sleeves have bulky cuffs that come down to my fingers and the sweater slides across my shoulders im it appeared overstretched and i feared it would only stretch out more over time and not be worth
3,good laptop this price
3,some heating issues occur after the switchon
3,other reviews are correct but this has potential to look as good as on the model structure and quality of the cotton are very flattering makes legs look miles long however this fits very tight allows no room for extra tummy hips booty or thighs i ordered a s im usually a was able to get it on step into it from the top but felt a little self conscious about how tight the fit was if there was an m would have definitely sized up as i really liked the look
3,for people of a certain age star wars is a part of the bedrock of our childhood i am of a certain age and i was a kid in the s watching the original trilogy on a vhs repeat loop it feels like gilroy co have actually tapped into that original nostalgia but have delivered us people of a certain age a story with nuance and intelligence that fits with the age that those s and s kids now find themselves at had i watched the content of andor in i would not have understood it or liked it and would probably have dismissed it that is the genius of this show and probably this was the puntpitch that gilroy co made to the disney executives hey lets make an intelligent exciting modern style thriller of a tv show that can stand up to the likes of sopranos and breaking bad but make it fit within the context of an idea that was created nearly years ago that really appealed to kids and young people at that time those kids have grown up now and they would love this this does not pander to a disney agenda of trying to make a new generation of star wars fans using a valuable intellectual property and make it a current generation friendly piece of work but actually they have delivered a piece of captivating television a piece of television that would standup on its own if delivered outside of the star wars universe thats the genius it gives us s kids the same if not a better a tv series drama that we expect in this modern age but perfectly and expertly dovetails it like a master carpenter into the same beauty of aesthetic that we loved as children so i echo the sentiment of others that have made the same call thank you for allowing me to be in my late s and enjoy a tv show and feel like i am years old at the same time if you asked another person to give you that experience they would most likely suggest you need to seek selfdelusion or magic for me this was magic
3,display is not up to the mark very worst display compared to my sony vaio i nd generation years old laptop
3,the dress is pretty and like retailer it is nice quality i just didnt keep it because it had no shape on me and even with a belt didnt look right i would have gone down a size in this dress also
3,very attractive pattern and color the black is so soft that it seems close to sepia the length was fine the fabric meaning the dress is quite heavy for not having a lining except just around the bra areaeven though the facing didnt successfully substitute for a bra in my opinion the arm holes are cut in quite a bit so one would have to find the appropriate bra the dress runs very large i ordered an xs petite it was about inches too large inches total on either side across the
3,i had different expectations for this shirt in blue and when i received the item it didnt met those expectations the material is very good quality but there is nothing extraordinary about the shirt it is jus very plain this item is being returned
3,battery backup is giving low battery power
3,i love these the color and the style but they are once again too short they are not inches i need inches to go to the floor these are above the floor so they are not inches very disappointing
3,i looked forward to this dress its a lovely design its a heavy material that doesnt have the most flattering fit the green lace has snags along the hemlines which is a disappointment im returning the dress
3,strictly for someone who wants to do work at home or any online class whatever if you want a chromebook this laptop is a perfect choice
3,for the price of this tee the beautiful front lattice work should have been extended onto the back would have been a classier more finished looking garment if the cost is not an issue then this tee makes a nice neutral addition to a neat but casual summer look
3,the models pose and description are misleading this top has absolutely no shape to it the front of the shirt is kind of like a slub shirt texture plain black the back print is nicejust more faded than shown in picture the entire design has no form it is huge also cheaply made
3,heating issue
3,for me its the masterpiece made by netflix and you dont know if you like thomas shelby or not but you cant take him of your head cillian murphy was a brilliant actor peaky blinders is a masterpiece
3,we enjoyed the first seasons although it does now feel like this show has run the course and its time to end elizabeth is excellent in this role she has the ability with her looks and her acting skills to be gorgeous and kind or plain looking and harsh the only caveat we have is that its taken so long to get near the end i realize there was covid and then the actors strike but this show in particular has taken an exceedingly long time this isnt the only show delayed we find that with most shows these days by the tine they decide on another season and get around to filming it weve forgotten a lot of the details of the show and have lost interest and moved on to something else gone are the days of loyalty to a particular show
3,this show offered me something both familiar and yet so different from the star wars i knew it had the style and themes that i had already been a fan of but it expanded on them made them seem much closer and real it always had a more grounded approach that made me immersed attached to the story and characters so much so that sometimes i felt like i was right beside them this show allowed me to view everything as it was happening from multiple sides all at once and somehow sympathise with all sides while still feeling like i am a part of it nothing ever felt dragged or forced everything deepened my connection to the story all of this caused the twists the brutal emotional and thought provoking scenes to make me think oh my god i cannot believe this made me get out of my bed and watch it standing staring with amusement shock fear sadness and investment all at once what i never expected was to catch a teardrop running down my face
3,cute little dress fits tts it is a little high waisted good length for my height i like the dress im just not in love with it i dont think it looks or feels cheap it appears just as pictured
3,although i am small size xs on top waist this dress is not flattering if have any fat on your bodyi would not recommend it
3,overall good laptop but the display is not as per expectation for mid level performance product is good
3,if you are buying laptop for simple use then its gud for you but if you are buying this laptop for working purpose then ill advise you that you should buy more effective laptop in comparison of this hp laptop bcz its getting heat problem after to hrs and nd is that this hp laptop screen rotation its open arround but i think it will be
3,there was too much mayonnaise
3,product quality is good but there is no backlit keyboard
3,i have more of an athletic figure and the sleeves tend to come in closer to the body than pictured i didnt like that cut on my armstorso the shirt is really cute otherwise i am usually a size small and this was a little short and snug
3,i really liked the look of this top online but when it came i had a couple of issues with it first when i tried it on i found the underarms to be a little snug i normally wear a m and thats what i ordered it makes raising my arms tough and as a teacher i need to be able to lift my arms above my waist secondly my husbands first reaction was that it looks like pajamas the abstract floralstripe gets a little lost on the other hand the color palette is very pretty and the qual
3,the best tv serious for ever now i can see tv after game of thrones please netflix we wait for season
3,i enjoyed season one and two but the story line for season just seems redundant so far i have to purchase the series in order to watch so i think ill spend my streaming money somewhere else
3,every series in the star wars universe maintains a baseline except for the acolyte and willow i think because of that every series to follow on disney is reviewed with hope and expectation andor season one was such a great backstory segway through its connection to rogue one in my opinion season two has the same production quality but far slower and mostly uninterest character development many people may appreciate the deep dive into character drama i feel on the other hand there are so many key characters with untold back stories sitting on the shelf thus far the fans i know would much rather be watching their far more diverse storey development in my opinion downshifting season two into a drama filled with mostly filler characters doesnt give the audience nearly as much content per episode as we should be getting but thats just my opinion im still gonna watch season two but the whole time im going to be hoping for more than what ive gotten so far honestly i worry that disney losing money means more of the same filler
3,i must say im not impressed with this show sometimes it looks like a fan show but it has its good episodes and as a huge star wars fan i have to say that i was hoping for more but well the show itself isnt bad whats bad about it is whats behind it a company that bears a red lightsaber a dark side company that supports censorship lucasfilm and disney shame on you i couldnt watch this show normally after what happened it was sad and made me sad and i dont think i would ever watch any star wars feature under disneys production with the same eyes your political opinion doesnt matter now what matters is the right of a person to express their opinion you like it or not the right of free speech we should not accept companies like those censoring their actors and it will affect their productions we should stop just accepting these kinds of actions just because the company is doing great material we dont want to live under disneys sith empire resuming ok show ruined by its companys actions for disney i have spoken
3,shes too cute the music and sounds are very nice its just a pity that the mechanism that mimics the breath is so noisy its kind of messing up
3,i bought this online in my usual size petite xxs for instore pickup when i tried it on the kindest word to describe it would be voluminousit was at least sizes too big on me i looked like i had taken grandmas tablecloth and constructed a homemade blouse the blouse comes with an attached cami which was also way too big for me the color is not white as described but rather an ivorycream colordefinitely not the best shade for my light olive skin i do think that it looks lovel
3,track pad is not that good otherwise it is a good option under this price
3,i returned this i got it originally for the features and wondered if itd be a mistake since the outside is not removable and washable i was so surprised that it was not even for snuggling it was so hard for the money especially i couldnt understand why this childs sleeping lovey was not in the least bit snuggly advertised
3,after using month to much noisy frequently getting blue screen finally un happy with this product
3,when i first heard of wednesday i knew it was something that i had to check out i am very glad i did wednesday is a show that will be sure to keep you entertained and wanting more i found myself binging the show and was pulled into the story from episode one if youre looking for a dark comedy show or just looking to try something new i would highly recommend this show jenna ortega does an amazing job on capturing the vibe of wednesday and is definitely worth the watch alone all the other cast members did an excellent job as well i will be waiting and hoping for a season two announcement from netflix to further entertain us with the fun and interesting adventures of wednesday
3,gorgeous design but it was just so heavy i felt overwhelmed by the amount of fabric although this is my fault for thinking i could get by in regular sizing as petite was sold out will be returning
3,i really wanted to love this but it had so much fabric around the waist i looked like i was about to deliver twins for ref im lbs the top area fit fine had a little extra room on either side under armpit area but not so much it wouldve deterred me from keeping it i adore peplum and flouncy topsit wasnt that i didnt realize that was the intended style here it was very cute from the front and back but when i turned sideways it was just omg huge like tent huge i kept look
3,the micro sd works great as described but beware that the micro sd adapters are faulty the micro sd will get stuck in the adapter you will have to carefully rip apart the adapter to get the micro sd out thus damaging the apapter
3,these are really nice pants color and style are perfect but when i first put them on they seemed like they fit perfectly on me then within minutes they looked sizes too big they got loose due to the material not being firm or thick enough i would go down a size for sure the cons arent unsolvable so try them out
3,the bars are alright but nothing special i used just one cup of sugar in the filling and it turned out fine i think the crust is too thick the topping doesnt add much to the recipe and i think it is unnecessary
3,it reminds me of maternity clothes soft stretchy shiny material cut is flattering and drapes nicely i only found one button to close front looked awkward nice long sleeves not for me but maybe for others just ok
3,sound quality low other okok
3,this is such beautiful material but the sleeves at the shoulders are terrible the gathered material makes it look like im wearing shoulder pads that structured element compared to the rest of the dress relatively unstructured just looks ridiculous i was so looking forward to this dress and now its going back
3,i wanted to love this dress i ordered an xsmall and a small i am and lbs slender build the xsmall fit great everywhere but the waist band was completely out of portion for the dress both sizes will have to be returned possibly if you have a more straight up and down figure it will fit better and pull in your waist
3,im a big mike white fan and i enjoyed season and of the white lotus but this season was a disappointment despite some great performances none of the characters stories paid off or resolved in any kind of meaningful or satisfying way some of them started out fairly promising and a few seemed to be leading somewhere compelling but by the end i had no idea what he was trying to say or do with any of these characters the guru says something in the final episode that could hint at the why of it all but whatever his point is was lost on me sht happens in the end i just didnt care about anyone and anyone i did start to care about made decisions that caused me to not care about them maybe its an intentional misdirect for ironys sake but either way it all felt a bit cynical and left me shrugging also unlike the first two seasons the location never offered anything seductive or enticing to make you want to visit or stay there which is kind of the hook of the show all of our characters were bored or miserable it was a chore for them and me it felt like the show didnt like or care about thailand as much as the characters didnt the few glimpses we get the snake pit the squirt gun festival the night life the lizards etc are all negative there isnt a single amazing only in thailand moment all of these stories could have been set in any number of locations i get that these resorts wall off the ultra wealthy from the locals but this season felt especially segregated theres a lot of nonthai staff at this thai hotel for some reason even the locals that our leads hang out with are other rich white people parker posey was great though and i liked sam rockwells heart of darkness monologue
3,boy i made this and it was an epic fail not sure what went wrong with all the star rating i must have really done something wrong although i can not figure out what it was the pecans on top definitely burnt as was warned but also the sides and bottom really burnt yet there was a thick layer near the bottom that was soggy and unbaked i must get a oven thermometer to check my temperatures what was edible was yummy
3,but i didnt like the fit maybe because i ordered petite and the length threw me off but they werent flattering in any way the color and material were unique and pleasing had to send them back though
3,i didnt have high expectations when i sat down to watch this show but ended up waching all epidsodes in one go it was addictive you can read the other reviews to give you insight into the plot i just wanted to write and say that its well worth your time to watch it i know not everyone will find it as enjoyable its a slow burn and once or twice drags a bit but overall it was very well done i am pleased that what was hailed as a limited season is now being renewed for a second season due to its buzz unfortunately the second season will not have the same great cast which is a pity as i wanted to know more about a few of the guests after the holiday especially the family group and the hawaiian spa coordinatormasseuse
3,this is just okay for me the top is soft and surprisingly flattering especially from the side but the front rides up and the neckline never lays flat it washes well and the tanwhite combo is cute but a little transparent
3,very very sweet cuddly animalunfortunately the movement of the belly is very loud and rapples somehow
3,i ordered this on sale after reading the review but i was disappointed when i tried it on the color is darker in person which is better for me but it looked dull on my skin tone pale also teh sleeves poofed in a weird way on the top where the seam meets the neck the overall cut is almost flattering a little long still for me in petite i felt like i was trying on a regular size so not for me for reference i ordered the p or xsp not sure right now i am lbs dd chest
3,havent made this recipe yet but want to try it kj if you cant have much dairy try your health food store for soy cheeses and ask your grocer to carry soy milk
3,nice laptop good display good keyboard but not backlit still its okay performance wise is also performed well so for me it was a value for money i have no complain for now
3,im athletic buildthought it was cute but in the end didnt like the color of the inner sweatshirtwish it was black or white send it back
3,guys please check your warranty first because in my case it was only five month left remaining for warranty seller dont tell you that it is refurbished or return item over all nice product
3,these are a great casual pants with a lot of style my major disappointment comes from the inconsistent sizing within the size runs i purchased a in store which fit i then ordered another online which did not fit there is at least an inch difference please see photos i then ordered a online to see if that would be better and theres over inches of difference within the same size run of the s who is making these pants cant they get the pants to be the same size within the sa
3,im sorry but as a life long star wars fan i saw the first episode the nd day out at the old fox theater in west covina ca i just cannot stomach this poorly written and executed disaster i was not a fan of diego luna in rogue one as he has little to no screen presence and comes across like a scared kitty my apologies to all you kitten lovers he was the wrong person then and still is this series is lacking anything remotely exciting and is so slow that i almost stopped watching after the first episodes disney must slow down and take a close look at scripts and the actors used while using great cannon and set periods that closely match the originals the overuse of british actors doesnt help it win over americans because the english tend to over act and some scenes come across in this series in an almost shakespearean manner i just hope with the poor execution and assuming they are doing a season i hope these things are taken into account
3,ive made corn casserole since discovering a recipe as a young newlywed from a church fundraising cookbook eons ago and it has been a great standby for many years as my kids grew i eventually quit making it some years back and now my youngest daughter who is now out in her own tries to make it the problem is that the industry has changed the cornbread mix formula and they just arent the same as the ones from back when when this recipe was really popular which is what prompted me to just stop making it corn pudding is a tried and true its todays mixes that can mess it up
3,this dress is very cute i loved it the quality is excellent however the fit is off im lbs c this dress was roomy in the bust and was a little too broad shouldered it was tight around the waist this caused creasing and buldging in the back the color is much more vibrant in person i would have kept it if it fit properly
3,this is a beautiful dress i sized up sizes based on other reviews and it fits well it is on the shorter side i purchased the blue and its a beautiful color i was in love with the dress until the zipper burst open after wearing it for five minutes i think im going to have the zipper replaced because i like it so much but at the high price point there should be a functional zipper
3,using this laptop for days and still now there is no such issue i upset as i was not provided backlit keyboard as specifications said for this particular item
3,i ordered this sweater in green in petite large the color and knit is beautiful and the shoulders and body fit comfortably however the sleeves were very long for a petite i roll them and it looks okay but would have rather had a normal petite length sleeve
3,battery was very bad not suggest for gaming display quality was not good only performance is good
3,as a constant fan of immersive apocalyptic and science fiction stories i have always been left disappointed with movie adaptations i know certain changes need to be done eventually to make the adaptation but other producers and writers seem to forget entirely that as long as you maintain the vibe of what you are adapting and not changing tons of unnecessary stuff you are good you can feel the passion put into this production from start to end i heard the director saying he was a fan in at the launch of the game bawling at sarahs scene should i say he nailed it years later even though things are changed i can logically see how they help the tv series flow more seamlessly and they dont impact the larger thread of events or the vibe of it we also get some extra scenes so we can better understand what happened the day of the outbreak as well as what its like for joel and tess to work a mundane job in the post apocalyptic world fedras cruelty is also displayed more evidently and we get to understand why the fireflies are such an important and growing organisation in their world i love it hope we get to see even more backstories on joel tommy and tess and why not marlene and how the organisations were formed but for now a p s as a depeche mode fan i leaped at the end of the first episode with happiness great choice of music overall
3,this is really a cute top nice fabric the print the version i bought is lovely though the colors are different than pictured the problem for me is that i am b with a longer torso and the proportions were just wrong on my body the blouse does not have much shape at all and fell a bit too short for my liking especially in the front it hit at hip level as in photo but would look so much better if it had been a couple inches longer looking at the other reviews i see that most of t
3,i see other people complaining here about this series being full of tropes and for teenagersits clear that it has a target audience but i dont see why this has to be bad i think this is very decent and entertaining if you enjoy teenya themes in literature or tv what makes a great work is not that the topic has to be superoriginalmost of the times the greatness lies in the execution and wednesday is well made the goth atmosphere is a fresh approach the actors are great the cinematography is good the only thing i didnt like is that the villain is heavily hinted from early in the game it would have been more fun if they kept us guessing a bit more the surprise factor was taken from this revelation otherwise i really enjoyed watching and i hope there are more seasons
3,i ordered this top in red gorgeous color and detail however just wasnt flattering on my more curvy shape felt like it looked like a maternity top
3,i loved this sweater when i bought it wore it a couple times then washed it according to the tag it shrunk at least two sizes and the tassels got all tangled which i guess i should have seen coming pretty bummed about it because this sweater looked beautiful on
3,im going to do the responsible thing and establish my biases right off the bat i loved the first game so much that for fathers day in my wife managed to buy me a ps and a copy of the last of us part ii and after some family time i sequestered away and played the game start to finish the last of us is my favorite franchise the last of us part ii is my favorite game dina is my favorite character and isabella merced is my favorite currently active actress with all that in mind i should be torn on my reaction to the show a true fan would be appalled at the changes or the casting or the but im not torn i am absolutely in love with this show i find the changes to be a strength rather than a weakness we have already played the game most of us many many times some in the audience never did and have no attachment but do have expectations different from ours the changes in the show accommodate both those they are also narratively interesting most important we need to remember that this is a different perspective a different telling a different approach to a familiar story its no different than how myth changed over time or how different comics give different takes on characters its what makes the mcu work too i could gush on so much about the show but it was more important to remind us all that this show is its own story and that we are being given another way to enjoy something great though i do have a complaint the physicality in abbys character that was actually important and they did everyone a disservice with their choice there for shame
3,not terrible not great but the nilfgaard armor is terrible there are problems with the narration and many heroes are poorly disclosed
3,i really wanted to love this top the material and pattern are lovely but the fit is strange it looks like a maternity top on me and as another reviewer said it is right across the back but loose at arms and midsection for the price i returned it
3,well i am satisfied with the product i will give my dtailed review after or months after using it for almost month feel battery is dischargeing very quickly its not worth for professional studentsfor simple gameing laptop it could do the work if we are connected to charging otherwise gameplays are not worthy
3,i bet playing witcher games helped henry to bring geralt of rivia on screens but this is different yet better than geralt from games i recommend this show to everyone who liked got because it feels like got imo
3,i like the idea of this but had to return it the fitted liner is attached at shoulders and awkward to get into the shirt is too poofy didnt flatter short and curvy
3,idk about this we are episodes in and the only thing that caught my attention was the fight at the very end of episode other then that i was actualy zoning out i wasnt interested in the characters and the story is progressing at a snails pace the dialog is fine the acting is fine its just bland this is average as average can get except for again the final encounter in episode but i need more then just good scene to keep my interest in a show i would be giving this show a bc its just so average nothing is really good and nothing is really bad except for how it looks the shots look good the cinematography is better then i expected the show overall looks really good and thats why i give it a but again everything else is just bland and unless it picks up quite a bit ill be moving onto a different show
3,the skirt is very pretty but its not as dark as the street pictures which i like those colors better its also super long it will have to be hemmed if i decide to keep it for reference im and it was sweeping the floor size medium given the price im not certain i will keep it ill try it on a few times then decide
3,this was really billowy but not in a good way i had to return it looks great in the photo but not so much in person
3,i was very disappointed to receive this and to note that the blouse has no ruffle down the front as pictured there is no ruffle anywhere on the blouse i am likely still going to keep it because i like the pattern but the ruffle was what interested me for a cute work blouse and i want other shoppers to know that the blouse actually includes no ruffle when you order it
3,i ordered these hoping they would look like the model but they didnt i am small but curvy it hugged too tightly in the hips so sadly these pants are going back
3,unfinished product loaded with equipment but not fully optimised
3,i really wanted to like this but i cringed at like every line that was said and that ruined the whole show for me its definitely not unwatchable cause i did watch the whole show but it did take me a while cause it was really slow sometimes and the whole detective thing got kinda boring after a while it did have its great moments and i think i could rate this higher if the writing was better and less cringe and dont even get me started on the cgi also most of the actors in this show that ive seen on other shows or movies are not bad but the script made them look like they were i have to write something random here to reach the limit ok bye
3,i loved the look of this tunic it is made well and very pretty it was so big and heavy i had to return it i think the small in this would be too big
3,im not satisfied this product
3,first monster fight was so terrible i was ready to see another third grade tvshow it was a good show had a good and acceptable ending you dont need to make every episode like game mission but following game story even with those mixed timelines was a good choice cgi was so bad but if we consider those game adapted projects fails in the past its make sense thanks to witcher character henry cavill didnt really need to show emotion except that goofy anger
3,this is quite good and more than a good series i enjoyed so much and i hope season will come up soon this guy needs to show us this real potentional of his shooting and fight skills series has pretty good humor and very good screenplay waiting for the next season
3,there were no reviews when i ordered this tunic so nothing to help gauge fit it is very cute but the fit is strange very narrow in the shoulders and chest
3,i really wanted this shirt to work the fabric is really cool but sadly the cut was just way off im and the shirt was much shorter on me than on the model and the cut was just too wide under the armpits
3,product was good but the seller doesnt give the tuf stickers for the laptop thats me a very sad and they made a worst package i ever see that that type of cheap packaging apart from this laptop is very good
3,wednesday director alfred gough and milles millar stars jenna ortega gwendoline christie riki lindhome jamie mcshane hunter doohan and percy hynes white genre comedy crime family fantasy mystery episode episodes ive really been looking forward to this series for a long time and that while this is my first contact with the addams family im going to say right away that the character theyve picked is really fantastic to make a spinoff about jenna ortega plays really really well and its that i dont like horror that much otherwise i would really like to see more of her in similar roles at first the series reminded me a bit of harry potter and you can also compare it to that that is where my first point of criticism comes in and that is that it sometimes looks a bit too much like harry potter sometimes things have been taken literally and i thought that was a bit of a shame i dont mean to say that i think the series is stolen but it could have had a bit more of its own style especially at the beginning especially with regard to the school the characters in the series are really really nice what i also really like about those characters is that they all have a little caracter arch not a very big one just big enough in my opinion for a first season what i also liked was that the addams family also gets a little more backstory in the series i will now go straight to my last point of criticism and that is that the series is perhaps a bit too much aimed at children yes it is really very dark at times but i would have preferred that the dialogue for example be a little less aimed at children what i also want to say is that the soundtrack is really fantastic again i definitely recommend watching this series if i had to describe this series in short i would say that it is a nice spinoff with nice side characters but that is a bit too much aimed at children there are some parts that gave me goosebumps im mainly talking about the final episode
3,i have to send the skirt back i agree with other reviewers who say the slits are extremely high the underskirt bunches and the fabric snags easily additionally the yarn was already fraying at the top of the slits and the label was stitched on the outside of the waist band disappointed in the quality of this skirt given the pretty steep price
3,episode gives us an interesting take on how the story will structure to the upcoming episodes with the previous star wars series not being able to live up to the hype as expected of them andor had shown us that even though the show is not based around popular characters in the star wars universe it deliverers an extraordinary story about the birth of the rebellion it also shows us that just like with the mandalorian you dont need to give a series on the characters we already know about from the key films but what we do want to see is to see new characters within the star wars universe and this series has definitely delivered with the first three episodes will be interesting to see how the next nine episodes play into the story
3,yellowstone despite being visually stunning sometimes feels too much like a soap opera the plotlines feels contrived relying too heavily on melodrama and shock value rather than authentic storytelling even this show is a bit cheesy there are some great performances and great dialogues it also manages to offer some likeable characters that contribute to its overall appeal making it a engaging watch to sum it like this if you are into prime time soaps then this show is a masterpiece for you if thats not your thing you can skip this one if you dont know whether its your thing or not then you can give it a try
3,these pants are cute they seem to me to have a wider leg than appears on the model they do run big so i would recommend sizing down if in doubt these are cute pants that can be dressed up or down but unfortunately look pretty sloppy by the end of the day as they stretch and wrinkle very quickly since they already run a bit big this is a major negative i wore them to church and they were quite wrinkled by time i got home by late afternoon they looked like a different pair of pants
3,this sweater has a fun big bold flower and a nice blue color and is quite roomy the fit is larger around the arms and chest which might work well for people who are very curvy on top it seems to taper a bit to the waist the roomy fit to the arms gives it almost a bat wing shape it was too overwhelming on my petite frame what with the bold flower and the fit so i passed but if you like the big flower and color and want a roomy sweater this could work well for you
3,i was on the fence about this dress because even on the model its a little bit frumpy but it was so pretty that i tried it however on my short frame its even frumpier the quality is very good the fabric is soft and its lined the pattern is really pretty and delicate and i wish it was more flattering i think the only way this dress will look good is if you are quite tall and thin i am lbs with largeish hips and i ordered a p but even the petite was too saggy i needed a
3,moderate device hangs within second day of usage not sure how reliable this can be in the long run getting hot with just the device turned on and having one or two browsers open battery drains much faster audio is just okay
3,the item i received was not distressed i bought one size larger thinking theyd be super slouchy but they just looked sloppy also the hips puffed out in a very strange way i wanted to love since they are so cute and soft but i look like a man with hips in these jeans returning this weekend
3,just good not
3,made these for years but use tomato soup intead of tomatoe sauce
3,worst display no backlit keyboard it is tn panel ips display is excepted for this price
3,laptop is good but i cant test its gpu i need gta free to test can anybody havin a link please send it is heating too much as compared to lenovo loq laptop
3,the mandalorian is the best thing about star wars in the last years my favorite tv show at the moment mando is such a good main character
3,doesnt fit as tightas slimming as you think it would by looking at the picture definitely order one size down if you want it to fit tight
3,the material is soft and the pattern is pretty but it fits like a sack its too bad that this wasnt more formfitting with some stretch and a zipper because its fit is just not beautiful for tall very slender ladies this will be pretty as it is in the photo it fit me just fine with a little extra room on top but it went right back into the bag without a thought
3,while the lead actor certainly looks the part he kind of lacks the wit and delivery so far of lines that lee childs writes so brilliantly when i first started reading the reacher books i visualised an actor like steven segal in the main role but this was many years ago and wouldnt work now if i could pick any actor of my choice i really dont know who would fit the bill maybe a younger steve austin whos menacing and broody all in all though it was an entertaining first episode and i look forward to seeing the rest of the season
3,the first surprise is that in person the material is actually kind of woolen at least i would definitely call it a winter knit the colors are also a little different so much so that i didnt recognize it in the store im not sure if the one i tried on was stretched out but it definitely ran large on me the waistband is elastic so i would worry about is stretching over time i would have been curious to see what the petite option looked like on me as the regular version was longer tha
3,processor is good charger is typce c battery is average upto hours display is poor as it is not ips less price we can get ips display overall comapared there is ips display laptop you can go with that
3,love the idea of this but it ran short and boxier than i would have liked material is soft cute design but not flattering returning
3,like the idea of this shirt so much but the neckline was still way too low the top of my bra was visible wishing the under layer really covered as no way im going to another layer to an already layered shirt might just be my body type so might work for someone else but sending back
3,i love the cold shoulder trend and this top seemed to satisfy i bought it in the blue which is really more like a very light mint green however i think the material is pretty thin though soft and the keyhole sleeve area right by the twist is not substantial so it looks a little cheap i ordered the small but i think i could have definitely sized down to the xs pounds dd its very loose fitting but i wouldnt say it looks bad its just a very relaxed fit for the price thou
3,i do not love these pants while the fabric is nice they make me look rather dumpy i highly recommend the essential taper pant instead which has beautiful tapering legs and made me look more slender these pants make me look like ive put on pounds and they also make me look rather squat perhaps they would look good on someone tall but at these are a miss for me
3,hurry up give us seasons i loved it i have never been interested in the addams family enough to watch the original series or the movies but this looked intriguing at first i was afraid that wednesdays monotone demeanor seemingly betterthaneveryoneatanything abilities was going to quickly get old obnoxious but then you keep getting to see little bits of different emotions doubts failures vulnerabilities just enough to keep me liking her more more as it goes on i was hooked jenna ortega tim burton made her the rest of the story a lot deeper more addictive than i expected and i am craving more please dont let this be another show that netflix cancels for no good reason keep it going and while youre at it also bring back dark crystal
3,i loved seasons and but four episodes into season and the magic is gone the characters arent just unlikable they are mind numbingly boring the male characters are all jerks and the female characters are catty or whiny i understand building tension and drama in a show but this is four episodes of repetition and characters literally repeating themselves over and over honestly i dont understand what mike white was thinking there is not one character that i find interesting or entertaining im going to ride it out just to see if im missing something or to see if anything interesting happens if this season continues on this course i pray that it is the last season
3,what a quality production for a tv series this is the real fantasy world everyone has been waiting for this will remove any previous fantasy world show you had watched before
3,the mandalorian is by far the best series i have ever watched and that is seriously saying something it has completely revived the star wars franchise and not only made up for the let down of the sequels but recaptured star wars in a way weve never experienced before with fresh perspectives from across the galaxy while also bringing back characters we know and love a must for all star wars fans and even people that are new to the franchise
3,i just received these jeans and the fit it good but they smell like moth balls and i have washed them twice already i hope it will go away otherwise i wasted
3,very pretty but runs tight i usually wear an or smallmed in retailer jackets and couldnt zip up the am a c and thickbroad at the top as there is no give this is also more like a fitted shirt made of lightweight muslinlike fabric was looking for a summer jacket to wear over knits in a chilly air conditioned office setting so sadly it didnt work for me could be cute on someone with a smaller frame over a tank or cami
3,i wanted to love this top i really did the color is beautiful the embroidery is well done the fabric is soft and it feels like it would be very comfortable in the summer heat but the armholes are big and so the holes show my bra which is not good i guess i could wear a bandeau or tank underneath but the armholes just kind of ruined my love for this top i think i will try again and order next size down
3,west of money this is chrome book not a laptop battery problem refresh problem or short keys problem etc
3,i bought this because i thought it would flatter my boxy big busted shape and it does however while i liked the irregular hemline on the model on my frame it hits at a strange place and so i will hem it a little shorter the fabric is extremely thin and not lined so this is definitely a light weight summer top even here in the south i love the modern styling but the quality of the fabric is a concern definitely no dryer on this one
3,i really wanted to love this top love the mix of fabrics and patterns but it is too short for a tunic length i should have paid attention to other reviews im about and was not too tight in the bust and shouldersi have to return because the length isnt right
3,i ordered this and didnt even try it on when it came the color was not as i expectedit had pinkish undertones and it just wasnt what i was looking for as far as color also the fabric is very thin not like the other two tunic dresses i have ordered recently from retailer toscana tunic sandscape swing dress it was also easy to see that this runs large oh well thought i might have one more fresh summer tunic dress to throw on in a flash but im happy with the other two i was finally a
3,title pretty much covers itbought it for my gopro with free day delivery with membership and the price it was a nobrainer
3,the otter is totally cute the sound is also great the motor is still quite loud i would have hoped that you could not hear it so clearly the otter would also have been a little better to be filled since you can tap the electronics battery my baby is not yet in the world yet i hope very much that the otter can calm them down or she can sleep well with him
3,half of the show is about wednesday adams and the other half is a copy of home before dark its strength is in its visuals theme color scheme effects etc and characters which made it always enjoyable to watch but its investigation story is a home before dark knock off i would have rated it if it had a stronger more original story wednesday dorms with her opposite enid they keep getting boyfriends but the best relationship potential is right in front of us the whole time wednesday and enid i was disappointed the creators didnt take it further was the greatest missed opportunity in the series
3,the color and designstyle are cute but i found this to be too oversized if you want to layer it then it might be for you but i was hoping for more of a tailored look
3,i watched both seasons and i really think they were each awesome its a wonderful combination of black humor relational drama and thriller set in overwhelmingly beautiful surroundings with impressive photography like those stunning visuals of the roaring see and accompanied by an exquisite choice of music the writing is intelligent the various stories of the different guests are all a gem in itself but then they gradually touch each other and get cleverly intertwined the acting of all major parts is topnotch its almost impossible to single someone out but i cannot leave jennifer coolidge unmentioned she is the only character that appears in both seasons and she is absolutely brilliant as the always optimistic but constantly disappointed and in fact tragic aging diva
3,i think this sounds good but the pizza influence is not there namely the seasonings in real pizza sauce basil oregano garlic salt and black pepper a can of paste added to the sauce simmer until it bubbles like the old mud pots at disneyland top the zucchini layer with sauce top with hamburger veg and cheese and that should bring this home ive been making pizza for years trust me this works otherwise its a great recipe and the zucchini rocks love keto
3,thought the cheery bars looked good but was more interested in the nutritional value for them i didnt make them as didnt know the point value for weight watchers for my familys needs hopefully soon that infor will be available and i can make these for my family
3,this dress was beautiful in person and the blue is almost electric in color i wanted to wear this to a party for a club i belong to however the bust on the dress is to big im ft tall and lbs with b bra size i got the p as i was worried about it being to tight it fit perfect except for the bust the way the top is cut and the black sheer fabric allows part of the bra to show in the cleavage area not worth they one to have it altered will return sad because its a fun dress to tw
3,i loved every second of the series it reminds me a little of the harry potter movies in a good way the plot is fascinating and attracts the screen to such a degree that it is difficult to stop watching for a second also i dont think there is anyone who could have played wednesday better than jenna and the only thing that disappointed me is that the series is relatively short and i finished it quickly and for something that draws so much to the screen i would have expected more but im definitely looking forward to a sequel series and seeing where it goes next and what else tim has planned for wednesday
3,overall product is good but there is no ms installed we have to buy subscription of microsoft there is no backlit keyboard
3,the worst part of this laptop is the battery backup i thought its a creator series laptop and it would give at least hours on normal usage it made me wrong and giving just hours in normal usage even in battery saver mode dont know is this in my laptop or in every laptop of this series another disappointment is heating issue even in normal usage it heats a hell the fan will start running and make sounds performance is ok on plug and play ie when connected with charger read more
3,i got this dress in the mail and while i loved the concept of it it really is too boxy the tie is very superficial and does not really nip you in at the waist it is more so for show it is fully lined which was interesting and to me made the dress seem boxier the quality is good but i am an hourglass and this was completely unflattering i would have had to size up to make it look like the model shot but it would have still been a shapeless dress just bigger it does fit true to size
3,i returned this one i usually love cecilia prado s artistic textiles and was very happy with her floraknit dress but this skirt was a disappointment it simply looks different from the picture its way more shimmery metallic in person which i could see a lot of customers actually loved but to me it made it look cheap also it lacks structure the ashape looks drab on this knit fabric
3,battery backup is only for approximately hrs if performance applications and games are used then the backup goes down to hrs performance is otherwise good and laptop is smooth and fast display is good as well
3,i was excited to see this top on sale as i had been watching it for a few weeks unfortunately i was very disappointed when i received it it is as a previous person said very much like a pajama top it is very loose and boxy and in my opinion did not flatter my shape at all sadly i will be returning it i would not recommend this top to a person who is athletic or straight and slender as you suggest
3,good laptop dont expect too much the build quality is not string so you have to be careful in handling not sure about the durability hence performance is fine so far as its new its claimed ips screen but i felt the screen quality is inferior my one of the purpose to buy this laptop was ips screen but the picture quality is not impressive sound is ok
3,the mustard colour was much stronger than it seems in the picture and it wasnt pretty on me plus the sleeves were very wide so that makes this not good for petite frames in my opinion it does run big i ordered m and i usually take m or even l in retailer clothes but i could have tried a s to make it less boxy too bad though because its a pretty shirt and different
3,heating up and battery back up is less as the problem of heating up rather product is good
3,tried small and medium and both were quite tight on the bottom top is perfect will return the bottoms and try the large
3,i know almost nothing about the early s history of england ireland or any part of europe so i cant speak as to the shows historical accuracy regardless the sets costumes and props together with the surprisingly good acting are very convincing the cinematography is also impressive with the perfect amount of saturation to pull you into almost every scene and make it feel like youre really there also its just the right amount of sex drugs and violence for a show of this genre to keep you coming back for more without making it feel like youre watching soft core porn or a cheesy slasher flick cillian murphy does a phenomenal job portraying the head of his budding crime family and dealing with the endless stream of physical and emotional volatility that comes with his position overall this is definitely worth watching
3,i bought this for an upcoming conference and was grateful that it shipped very promptly it runs quite large in my opinion im and about lbs the small was huge on me in the chest and shouldersarms the stomach also wasnt very fitted the material is thinner than i expected you can see through the dress to some extent when you hold it up to the light but i dont think this is a problem necessarily had it been thicker it probably would be too warm but you might need a slip
3,i bought these for a trip to the caribbean i sweat a lot if you have ever been humiliated by having a ring of sweat around your crotch area then i do not recommend these shorts in the moss color this color and fabric do not camouflage sweat i will spare you the photos
3,the colors on this sweater are cute the fabric is good quality and not too thick for spring the fit is tts
3,both seasons are perfect and im looking forward to the final season three mike white is a master and everyone involved with making this show happen both seasons are perfect and im looking forward to the final season three mike white is a master and everyone involved with making this show happen both seasons are perfect and im looking forward to the final season three mike white is a master and everyone involved with making this show happen both seasons are perfect and im looking forward to the final season three mike white is a master and everyone involved with making this show happen
3,the high neck and squareness did not work for me but might for someone else
3,ive played the games i played the witcher once assassins and kings twice and the wild hunt ive played for hours so you can call me a fan of the series ive not read the books but i was prepared that it was not gonna be exactly like the games me and my dad are big fantasy genre fans but my father has never heard of the witcher since i am a fan of the witcher i almost forced him to watch the witcher i did some minor explaining beforehand to make him somewhat familiar with the witcher universe for me watching this was easy i knew who and what the characters are and what they represent my dad not so much he found it slighlty difficult i could go on and on but i wont hes a fan of the witcher universe and geralt now too well done netflix not all beloved bookgame tv adaptasjon are as good as this to put it mildly but you made me happy and my dad
3,not very good compared price
3,season of the last of us is a textbook example of how a strong foundation can be squandered what began as a series marked by emotional gravity narrative precision and grounded character choices has devolved into a hollow melodramatic shell of its former self the shift in tone is jarring where season built tension through moral ambiguity and careful pacing season leans into teen drama tropes complete with romantic angst overacted grief and emotional scenes that often defy internal logic the world these characters inhabit is supposedly brutal and unforgiving yet their decisions increasingly ignore this reality take the central revenge arc the idea that two young adults essentially still kids would set out on a crosscountry revenge mission against a group they barely understand with no intel on terrain no backup plan and no clear objective is absurd the only rationale offered is ellie is immune as if that cancels out every tactical and survival risk you could chalk this up to youthful recklessness but the way its presented lacks nuance weight or even basic plausibility it feels lazy not tragic some moments are outright implausible within the established logic of the world structurally the season fails completely abby a central character in the second game only appears in the final scene setting up day one in seattle the game gained emotional complexity by letting players experience the conflict from both sides the series opts instead for a full season of onesided buildup with no payoff it feels like narrative stalling all setup no substance i never played the games but i dont need to whats on screen should stand on its own and it doesnt this season abandons the brutal realism that made the world believable and instead becomes a stylized comingofage story in a world that was never meant to be romanticized a generous purely out of respect for season and the world that once was
3,top is well made runs large the arm holes were too big and sagged under my arms showing my bra go a size smaller than your normal size
3,slower than expected transfer rates when used with phones and tabletsi had expected higher transfer rates given the data class
3,best laptop under this price
3,i sized down one size and its still too big with the double vneck style this is going back
3,i was not familiar w this series before the show was aired at first i was quite confused it took me a couple of episodes to understand that they were jumping timelines however for the most part i really did enjoy the show i ended up rewatching the show again this week first watched it when it aired in and ive got to say that i caught on to a lot more detailsplot points the nd time around as i understood the timelines definitely recommend
3,battery not good percentage drains as soon
3,i ordered the light pink version in size xl the details of the top and the shade of pink are pretty but the shirt fits me much shorter than on the model im not quite ft inches so it should have worked the material is thin so i was able to stretch it out to give more length it does look stretchedout now though i washed it and it shrank a bit so i stretched it again this is a top that i kept to wear under vests the pretty colors and the softness of the material make it worth keepin
3,i ordered this top in colors because i thought it would be great with leggings i always love my retailer purchases but this fell a little short i think it may be the type fabric it is but the way the back hangs so low on my frame it doesnt drape nicely over my leggings the style of the top is very cute and maybe if i wanted it for skinny jeans it would be ok i returned them both to the store this is one that would be better to try on first
3,this pie was easy to put together but very sweet it seemed to be missed something so next time i will add cinnamon and nutmeg as other readers suggested it has a lot of potential and i loved the crust
3,i got today delivered but after hrs usage its buttery smooth performanceand battery gb ramtb storage once i update review on performance after an month iam updating a review a week use keypad was not smooth its very irritating and photoshop is running slow and other i update soon
3,i cant believe how small these are i almost wondered if the size was marked incorrectly these are so pretty and such a shame because i love them the rise in the crotch is also very short very full in the legs and one is longer than the other the stripes dont line up in places which is also disappointing for this price
3,everything is good in this product but after months i faced a very big issue its hinges stuck and the screen is very thin thats why the screen panel sometimes shaking
3,hanging problem
3,i love a cropped pant but these do not hit the mark the pant would have been more flattering if they hit just above the ankle instead of the calf i think they make the leg look stunted the material was a nice weight and good quality but the bow being attached was a big design flaw it look cute tied but would have been much nicer if you could remove it when needed
3,ok this show is not everyone or a medium starwars follower first of all this show does not focus on cassian andor only but on many characters and their big sacrifices to start an organised rebelion against the evil empire the pressure soul breakers and obstacles are so well told that rogue one and new hope movies are much more meaningful now and this depth of a character reveals helps you to emphatise with their motives when a character is left alone to pick a decision between a bad one and a worse specificly younger audience will not be able to hold their horses to wait for an event to happen in andor where the story has a constent slowburn to reach any climax point and this is fine since for the first time we are able to see a street level impact of the empire where fear and control are the main tools that they use first season so far has arcs for various events leading the whole story in a fascinating way each arc has its own exposition rising action climax falling action and resolution parts where any arc resolution triggers an other stone in the story this level of story telling character and writing is very rare for any television show and one of a kind in starwars saga which puts this show in a special place well done to tony gilroy finally one word for casting wow what an acting performance all characters are well fit to their roles and acting is off the charts i am very surprised happy and carried out to watch this mature feet on the ground unexpected star wars show
3,if i could give this stars i would hands the best tv show of all time and thats with sopranos etc wow every actor is fantastic i binge watched the first seasons as i couldnt stop watching fantastic show
3,this tank seemed like it should have been a maternity top way too much fabric not flattering for those of us with a larger bust i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are
3,the batter is very thin following this recipe and ladle size that batter will just spread and spread in the pan my first pancake was basically a crepe i wasnt using a huge pan had to add more flour to the recipe so eventually it wound up okay but i had to play with it first
3,i absolutely loved this dress the style is flattering and the mix of fabrics and lace make it truly feminine and unique the only problem is the bust runs really small i normally wear a in retailer but i ordered a and and and both were way to tight in the bust very disappointed because i really wanted to keep this dress
3,saw online and had to have got it home and i was swimming in it i normally am a size l in most retailer brands but this felt so large the actual top is lovely with an airy artistic quality to it not sure if i will go back for the medium or not
3,i ordered this online in the cream color and because some of the reviews mentioned the shorter back i went with a medium but that ended up running too big i typically wear between a and a small and medium so im always on the fence about which size to get i often order both online and return the one that doesnt fit as well so i wish i had this time too the detail on the front is super cute and i didnt even mind the plainer back but the sleeves went well past my wrist and i felt li
3,love the warm fuzzies of this sweater did not love the unflattering cut the sweater hung lifelessly from my bust line down plus it was a little short in the front i have to send it back
3,you can find mistakes in all movies tv series programs etc rarely do you catch any errors on your first viewing this tells me people are watching the same episode of yellowstone at least a couple times i actually watch each episode three times in one week im so captivated by the characters i dont think i could find any mistakes great work defining each character i pick them apart and try to figure out what is actually going on in their heads so much emotion going on here and each week it only gets better great casting i cannot wait for season
3,average tn display low quality not ips display
3,i had a beautiful pan of dumplings turned off the heat and went to get our plates and not a dumpling in sight they all fell and turned into hard lumps of dough i dont know what happened was trying something new for my hubby and didnt turn out
3,the character of wednesday is played by jena ortega while tim burton gandja monteiro and james marshall are the directors of the production wednesday is one of the best new shows on netflix but the streaming services original productions may not be for everyone she displays all of the characters peculiarities coldness and cruel comments yet in such skilled hands wednesday is neither cartoonish nor onedimensional displaying remarkable depth instead in this series tim burtons penchant for morbid humour and passion for the macabre as well as his love of hammer horror films are on full display even the supporting cast is excellent highlighted by emma myers as enid who is able to bring out the best in our heroine despite the fact that she is colourful this programme is going to be right up your alley if you liked the last iteration of wednesday addams this young actress has a promising career ahead of her in hollywood particularly due to the mesmerising performance she gave in the film
3,looks beautiful online but has too much material and the zipper catches on the lace also runs very large i am normally a small but would need and xs in this dress
3,its incredibly confusing and nonchronological storyline can be bothersome but it was only after finishing the entire season that i realized what i just watched the first few episodes leave you guessing what am i actually watching but i promise you as the show proceeds it will slowly and carefully eliminate your doubts the acting is terrific the music is amazing the casts are except for king foltest the witcher universe is amazing the mages are mysterious and beautiful and henry cavill is born for the role of geralt of rivia furthermore the series contains some real interesting dialogue which gets better and better as the show proceeds and the landscapes are like no other fantasy ever showed and the magic what you often see in other fantasy shows are paranormal abilities like magic being unbelievably overpowered destroying the power balance and making it really hard to actually see the merit of any action or strategy in the witcher however the magical aspect is perfectly done it has tremendous potential power but at great cost and of course this series is not short on love its love is interesting mysterious and in some way melancholic ive heard people calling this series the cheap got but i dare to say with at least six more season in mind the witcher has the potential to beat got to the king of fantasy it has everything a show needs and this in a world with endless potential to explore
3,other windows install not working touch screen
3,i loved the lace detailing all over this dress and the fact it had pockets and was mostly cotton it just looked so inviting so i grabbed two sizes to try on that of the time fit me with retailer clothes here are my thoughts __________ pros lace detailing is lovely all over everything runs tts except at the bust see below breathable fabric comfortable _________ cons im a c and could not button the top two buttons of this dress in a size im hourglass a
3,i thought it was the perfect dress by the picture but it ended up looking like a grandma muumuu the color is nice the neck is cute but the form unflattering im trying to decide if i want to taylor it or take it back
3,there is nothing special about this skirt its plain and incredibly dowdy looking long and wide i am usually between a small and medium after reading the other review that said the waist ran small i went with a medium it fit fine in the waisthips
3,this is a great show with fun characters and solid casting you can tell they put a ton of money and effort into the show and its been enjoyable watching each episode the bad reviews all are just attacking the show by comparing it to the old adams family and that it doesnt live up to it as someone whos seen the old adams family this show is an amazing modern take and i hope they make season giving a good show a because you liked the original better doesnt make any sense for a review thats like throwing away worth of silver because youd rather have worth of gold good enough story great casting fun character lots of mods to the original all around its a great show and i cant wait to finish the last episode
3,like the first reviewer i love the color and look and agree that it is much longer and wider than it looks in the photo i am lb and ordered a small i was planning to wear it tucked into palazzo pants as the model seems to have done but they must have used some other way to gather up the sweater in back because there is no way such volumes of material can be tucked into anything and the metallic threads are itchy so i had to finally layer a full sleeve tee under it to be able to st
3,i thought this top was so pretty and airy but it just didnt work out i typically wear an xl in retailer and was able to size down to a l in this top i ended up returning because the front is pretty sheer and the black tented out in a weird way about halfway down there is a seam across and without this it would have hung perfectly disappointed
3,i had to change my rating after season i changed it from to a generous it was nice to see the witcher as a lonely hero fighting with monsters etc as was the case in season of course it was to be expected that he would change a bit after ciri i did expect that ciri would be a kind of daughter to him i didnt expect though such a luck of wisdom from him attachment and love is not the same thing i mean come on he is hundreds of years old and he turns into a very possessive and oppressive father in the last episode of season there is a twist which is the most crazy and outrageous thing these people must be really desperate to put in something so ridiculous also have in mind that the episodes are not made by the same director i bet season will be terrible i expect more psychological problems conflicts ridiculous plot etc instead of good story and adventure
3,after using this my face felt lovely soft and cooling i felt very refreshed and ready to go fight the day even if i had woke up feeling tired and drawn this helped me i love the smell of it and its so easy to use even my child uses it and so far i can see a difference in her face this review was collected as part of a promotion
3,this show is amazing the story the action and the acting casting henry as geralt will go down as one the greatest casting decisions in cinematic history im shocked like james spader on the blacklist and hugh jackman as wolverine the character geralt is practically made for henrys acting style and onscreen personality incredibly i believe he will become more famous as the witcher than as superman great show
3,i was so excited to get this top i love the bow at the neck and the frill sleeves so current unfortunately it was difficult for me to pull it over my head the neck opening is too small and there are no buttons i have a pretty small head and very fine straight hair so i can imagine that others will have a similar issue getting it on i am keeping it because i love the style but will need to alter the neck myself the rest of the top fits just a bit loose i got the xsmall and am a
3,i order the blue and orange endora wing dress in an xxs and it was still very large i know that this is a flow dress but there was so much excess material that i looked like i was swallowed the colors are more muted than in the pictures a faded blue and orange that i didnt really like return
3,picked up this memory card at a great price on a gold box deal reputable name fast card however after several months of trying to get my phone to work with the card formatted it partitioned it mounted the card unmounted the card all to no avail i realized that this memory card is not compatible with my samsung sght galaxy s g no need to get frustrated and try a sandisk ultra gb class card in the phone i replaced this card with a plain sandisk gb class card in my phone it was immediately recognized formatted and mounted by the samsung phoneymmv
3,what a superb series this has proved to be i was under the impression it was aimed at a much younger audience but that is certainly not the case ive been a huge fan of the addams family since a young boy and this was one of the best takes on the whole series as a huge tim burton fan i had huge expectations and they were absolutely met jenna ortega is perfectly cast and absolutely superb as the lead character and the rest of the cast were utterly amazing the direction and cinematography are first class there was some outstanding sequences and the whole premise of the series was excellent if you want a series to loose yourself in i for one cannot recommend it highly enough
3,this is baggy on me in my regular size this happens to be a good thing because its also very thintissue thin material the reason thats a good thing is i can wear another t shirt under it with all that extra room and it hangs nicely im hoping it shrinks a bit when i wash it in hot waterthe design on the front is the only real reason im keeping it
3,i was blown away by season of reacher it was refreshingly entertaining sadly i cant say the same for season im listening to bad luck and trouble the jack reacher audio book on which season is based season follows the book incredibly closely word for word in places that said its no surprise that just like this book and ive read or listened to all of them the tv series is irritatingly trite and cliched if i hear no one messes with the special investigators one more time i think ill go mad its been said by almost every character in the book and the tv series except the police guy reacher punches senseless everyone else says it at least once and sometimes twice perhaps lee childs the author was in the doldrums when writing this story and thats a great disappointment it had so much potential whats more annoying is that the script writers didnt address the books obvious shortcomings but the audio book has one positive that the tv series lacks i dont have to see reacher with bulging eyes almost squeezed shut by too much weight lifting too many protein shakes or other substances that increase internal pressure i hope series is better
3,what started with an explosive start has turned drab and drag for the love of god one has to suffer the elizabeth moss and her expressionsless face it gets offputting after some time she is being given a disproportionate amount of time screen space and character growth at times it gets idiotic and unrealistic put her out of the misery probably bcoz elizabeth moss had control over the the production she has forced her personal aspirations to the detriment of the show
3,great little card the only problem i have experienced may not even be related to the card but android os itself i experience bufferinghiccupspauses when watching a video if i also have my utorrent client in the background downloading i am not sure if this is limited to the card itself and possibly a faster write speed is needed or its the fault of the phones os however i am confident that its operating within speccard looks good too too bad its in the case of my phone never to be seen
3,the fabric is flimsy and not substantial i thought it ran a little small i usually wear a large in this style but it was too tight
3,i was looking for a basic tee but this one was just okthe quality is okay but it us not as soft as i would have liked unfortunately i will be returning this item
3,im lbs and bought a size i loved this dress but didnt expect to have to go braless or wear a tube top under the top lands much lower than i expected but the rest of the dress was lovely i ordered a size
3,this recipe is at least years old nothing wrong with that from weight watchers it is very good but i agree with the first reviewer not a fan of cool whip and im not a fan of anything that is sugar free there are some funky ingredients in both cool whip and the sugar free jello
3,doesnt clean my clothes too well and if there is too many clothes they wont smell good other wise price is good
3,beautiful dress but the fit was off for me overall this is good quality with beautiful lace detail as the other reviewer mentioned the cutout in the back is very cute i wanted to love this dress but i found it to run large in the top im lb with c and i ordered the small the top just hung off of me perhaps it would have been better with an xs
3,i was disappointed with this dress because it is not the usual retailer quality the quality of the material is not very good ive bought boiled wood jackets from this brand before and theyre very soft and very well made hence my disappointment i agree with the other reviewers in that this dress runs very large and the length is short for a winter dress
3,no backlit keyboard overpriced product
3,never wrote a review before but this show hands down is a ten out of ten
3,i always have to try on tops of retailer i know this and yet i ordered a top through the website anyway i dont think ill do it again the drape of the top seen in the pictures did not translate in real life because the top scratched up pretty quickly ironically when i washed it according to directions it also shrunk quite a bit
3,white lotus season is a stunning emotional masterpiece set in breathtaking thailand the scenery is serene yet contrasts the inner chaos of each character ricks journey was powerful chelseas heartbreak felt real and the buddhist themes added rich depth though slowerpaced it allowed more thoughtful reflection the cinematography was dreamlike the acting topnotch its both satirical and deeply human the ending beautifully haunting this season didnt just entertainit moved me easily my favorite of the series i am very much looking forward to season of white lotus and where we got to next
3,i so wanted this blouse to work the lacework is beautiful and it is a substantial and well made top the neck fits well which is not a given for this style top and i really like the length sleeves but the top billows out like a tent on me in all directions and it was an awkward length on me not quite hip length not quite tunic wish this were cut a little straighter and longer im lbs and tried a size s
3,i put this in my samsung skyrocket phone even though the phone says gb max it still recognized and formatted the card its great to have all of that spacehowever any time i try to use the usb mass storage mode to transfer files it errors out i thought it was the phone since it was larger than the max spec but then i tried it in a usb card reader i had it still errored out trying the same files finally i had to put it in the adapter and stick it in a card reader built into a laptop and transfer the files that wayi think the issue was that using the usb the files were writing too fast and faulting out and with the laptop transferring the files from the wireless network and then to the card the transfer speed was slow enough that it was successful took all night to get my stuff on the card thoughi use it mostly for pics and video on my phone also works great the phone seems to have no trouble accessing anything on the card and it seems plenty fast for it even when recording high def video which i do a lot of for work
3,i made this pie the taste was excellent but it was so runny i went back through recipe to see if i missed anything but i hadnt any idea why the apples were soft but still in shape
3,ritchson is a great reacher but to see his real acting chops you need to see him in his most challenging role thad castle in blue mountain state the reacher character is like second nature to ritchson its like hes playing himself but castle was a complex creation demanding a kind of brinksmanship in his personality even harder to keep consistent over three seasons even with good writing it takes real chops to do well
3,when ordering this product i thought it was strange that the mediums were sold out i went with the small which is generally what i wear however these run small and i see why the medium ran out they are pretty however i wish they made them more true to size
3,if you like sweet corn pudding this is the recipe for you if you dont like it sweet just omit the sugar and use cornbread mix that doesnt have sugar i like to omit the sugar and add cheese jalapenos and onions
3,goodbut lite damage and screen light issue
3,overall its a beautiful dress and i really wanted it to work but the material feels cheap at least not what youd expect for the price and as other reviewers have mentioned its just a tad too short for reference im lbs and the fit well but hung well above my knees theres no way i could wear this without unintentionally flashing a few people sadly this dress will be returned
3,true to size on the neckline and arms but extremely large and puffy in the torso very unflattering cut
3,i i hesitate to say that i dont recommend this dressit really is so prettybut a different fabric might have worked better more importantlythe cut is not rightfor me anyway the neckline is a little high and the dress starts to flare out from the lower end of your boobs and continues all the way down giving a very wide lower halfway too much fabric at the bottomlooks like a triangle if they done a scoop neck and a shift style it would have been perfection
3,medium
3,it is a good machine but with some drawbacks while gaming you can feel the heat as the exhaust vent is opened towards the display the screen itself gets a bit hot again the temperature would not affect the screen but you can feel the warmth on your finger tips on the keyboard while gaming it feels a bit uncomfortable i have played gta minecraft valorant and palworld in it the performance it gives is as per the expectation it performs what it should be there is no tweak the rt read more
3,for office work properly but not value for money
3,i like my clothes loose fitting but even for me this ran large i am b and medium fit in the shoulders but was too big overall
3,there is no back zip on this skirt and therefore it does not lay flat as it would if there were a zip instead it has an elastic waist it is very nice quality but i never would have purchased this skirt if i knew it had an elastic waist i am and a size it runs a bit large i think this is due to the elastic waste
3,i have used this laptop for over a year and i can definitely say that it is a great machine however i have encountered a few minor issues the predator sense software is not functioning properly i am unable to switch modes or control the fan speed additionally the software is outdated and lags significantly i would not recommend this laptop and the customer service is very poor i did not expect this
3,i dont know if i was sent a petite by mistake but this is not inches long i realize it says swing dress but i thought if the length was accurate and the fabric heavy enough the weight would make it flattering on me as it was in realityshort and lightweight fabricit poofed out in an unattractive way too bad as the print is lovely
3,i was so excited to receive this top but was immediately disappointed it is much thinner than it seems it almost feels like a cheap top its also seethrough but im not bothered by that it has a very boxy cut which i like with slimmer bottoms but overall i didnt care for this top expected it to be more structured stiff rather than flimsy thin its going back
3,i loved it at the beginning but if you start feeling like every step is filmed nearly like a slow motionwatching it fforward x then there is a problem more like an artshow
3,the first two seasons were unbelievable and fantastic a slow driven terror and thriller joined with many emotions for both men and women brilliant acting for many roles and an exciting scenario as well nearly most of the reviews were beatiful about first seasons but for th mostly it is not liked will add more review after definitelyespecially despotism and a very similar autocracy were shown in deep detail where many people can find clues and resemblences for what has happened to america in the past two electionseven burying the real religion and adapting a new worse one is also crushing everything and tries to create new good and evil now still watching and nearly end s and believe me this is one of the best series ever created like breaking bad or similar even s is briliiant and breath taking so leave evetything u re watching and start this
3,battery service average display performance design sound
3,i am torn about this dress the print is very pretty and the fabric has a gentle flow to it the top part is great but the portion below the chest reminded me of a tent it is tricky to pull off if you are wellendowed on the top or wear a padded bra i liked the look better when i tied it at the back with the ultrathin belt straps which gave some shape to the waist i agree with the other reviewer that a slim person could carry the look well i usually dont return online purchases unless they
3,i loved the first season and even preferred the second full of colourful characters doing amusing and entertaining things anchored by the magnificent jennifer coolidge not forgetting the excellent tom hollander and then came season where the characters are with one or two exceptions actually rather dull and predictable where things almost explode and then dont and where the drama in the last episode feels rather contrived all in all many hours wasted waiting for nothing to happen as if they focussed on the location and background colour and forgot that you also need a gripping story so disappointing they should have left it at
3,i am a large in knit tees this is the first tee where the large was just too big it kind of hung on me the band across the back also hung down so all over it looked like it was just too big a size for me the army green turned out to be not a flattering shade of green for me so i returned it i liked the whole design a lot especially the front macrame part but for me it did not work at all also too expensive for a tee
3,we absolutely love this show and look forward to seeing it each week an amazing cast with a great story line kevin costners role of the patriarch of the family is outstanding and how his characters children all play a role in keeping the family ranch together reminds me of the show dallas yellowstone will not disappoint
3,i love the metallic colors of this top and figured i could wear it under a ruched jacket and circle skirt for work welp thats out the window this design is poor for one this is not a piece for a petite woman with no torso and i dont know how anyone with a longer torso wears t his this hits above my belly botton on and i got apetite i have no torso so without a jacket i would never wear this its very low cutthe back is very lowits a little loose but i run between a and a
3,im writing this to warn others that these run small i ordered my usual small and then because of the elastic waist i also ordered the medium neither size fit me even the medium was not only too tight in the elastic to be worn at the hip as shown but too short waisted to be worn at the waist they are generally smaller everywhere which just seems wrong in this style pant also take note these are slit up the side which i could not see in the photo its not a high slit but still does c
3,i love the design of this and the pattern its comfy but a bit too much side boob for actually swimming i like a bit more coverage the front has great coverage but on the side whoa
3,after reading the reviews i decided to give this a try but it just didnt work on me im smaller on top and usually wear m in retailer sizes this was ok in the shoulder and arm area but a little too snug for me in the hips also the diagonal striping made my boobs disappear and the pattern at the bottom emphasized my tummy and rear not exactly the look i was going for back it goes
3,i was excited to receive this dress because it seemed like a beautiful breezy dress for summer unfortunately i didnt find the fit to be very flattering as two other reviewers mentioned there is too much fabric creating an odd bunching especially at the back waistline i also found the dress to be a little tight across the bustline upper arms and shoulders the bunching can be improved by pulling the fabric of the dress forward in the front but this creates more of a plunging neckline than i
3,display is bright enough but not fhd performance is enough at this price multitasking will not support starts lagging on opening apps but for normal users its good for watching videos and browsing its good dont expect too much performance from this lap for study purposes its good at the price range
3,online this top looks fabulous but in person not so great great color nice quality for a lightweight top but when i tried it on the neck does not lay nicely too much sloppy wrinkled material just hanging awkwardly around the neck and i love cowl neck i found for me it dipped very low showing cleavage and i have a large chest so didnt work for reference im and usually wear a small in retailer tops because it seems the majority of their clothes run large i purchased a smal
3,a bad cooling system shuts down every time while playing video games buy a cooler if youre buying this
3,i love the back detail but doesnt feel that comfortable on i bought in green its fitted so get size larger if you plan to layer up im and bought xs size i should have ordered the s
3,for my taste it was extremely sweet it may be a good recipe if the sugar was cut in half
3,i agree with the other reviewers this sweater was strangly shaped in the waist in an unflattering way the rest of it was beautiful though looks too much like maternity even in a petite xs so its going back
3,i bought this in black its a great long length i have long arms so the sleeve length is great its really soft only issue is seems to sag a little in the middle instead of being flowy overall a good tunic
3,this is a lot shinier in person and the elastic band is really tight but i still selected true to size there is a hilo hem going on that doesnt flatter my legs but it looks fantastic from the side due to the stiffness of the material and the tightness of the band it can get crumply on the side if you dont get the right size the material feels a little thin and scratchy
3,i ordered this dress in my usual size and unfortunately when it arrived it was damaged and also a little too big the fabric had lots of pulls in it like it had been tried on many times i called customer service and requested a replacement in a smaller size it fit great and looked beautiful but there was a rip in the sleeve this is a gorgeous dress and very flattering and well fitting if you size down but i had to return both and wear something else to a holiday party id only recomme
3,the product is okay for regular use sometimes when it is loaded heavily video in youtube freezes where you want to reduce the resolution not useful for programming or gaming if your use is just for daily use email checking it fulfills your requirement
3,ok but microswoft office not provide
3,this top is gorgeous in both detail in color it fit great and true to size but then i hand washed it as instructed on the label and it shrank substantially to the point that its now too short and needs to be returned
3,i have been a big fan of this canadian designer so when i saw the sweater on the web i immediately ordered it on the website it looks very modern and edgy chic i was heartbroken when i saw it in person when i opened the bag and put on the sweater i noticed a lot of little black marks on the bathroom floor it came from the sweater size small was swimming on me and the holes on the shoulders which supposed to look modernwell the thin cheap material the sweater looks like its ripped
3,i love the style but it didnt work for me i ordered the r size they were way too too long i generally wear size and the r length works with most retailer pants with this particular pant i could barely pull up the zipper im not sure what happened bc i havent gained any additional weight i am and lbs unfortunately i had to return the pants i think the design is for supermodels maybe a petite size would have worked the p was out of stock good luck
3,this top was so beautiful exactly like the image shows but the waist was so tight it was uncomfortable enough that i am going to return it sad because the top and arms fit great i am an hourglass so my waist is very small compared to my top and bottom oh well next time
3,i suppose you either think its great or its the or i am interested in after reading the reviews i thought id give this series a go overall its a little slow paced at times the reason for a but incredibly well acted and a interesting piece of speculative fiction some see it as a sjw or progressives dire warningstriggers and others look at it as a stab at christianity maybe its their worst nightmare who knows and really who actually cares after all it is a work of fiction plain and simple interesting because you could see our world going that route in a what if crazy sort of way or as something similar to what may have happened in past timescultures either way its a great story so far i recommend putting it on your list looking forward to season
3,was just ok wont make again
3,john dutton casey beth and best of all rip amazing characters and one of the best shows ive ever watched
3,i gave it an for seasons and brilliant was ok but the standard was falling fast season is just bad bad writing annoying characters and acting let it be done praise be
3,i absolutely loved the first season and thought that just like many other shows it would get bad with each new season this show is so good that the writing in each season is just as good as the previous seasons or gets even better and thats something that few shows can say for me its one of my favorite shows at the moment and i love how they bring out new characters and story lines with each season aside from or recurring season and example this show is truly the pinnacle of excellence when it comes to writing and acting and the fact that production doesnt hurt either if i would ever create a show this show would be the example i would use keep it up writers and actors
3,color not as vibrant as in the picture skirt is darted which is not clearly seen in the picture assumed would be cut on the bias which im more familiar with in slip dresses i didnt fill in the bust and the style is such that it isnt possible to compensate with helpful undergarments while not for me im still recommending it because it may fit others better reviewers are instructed to avoid writing about customer service but i feel compelled to note that the customer service i have
3,yellowstone has gotten very very good at writing slow episodes that waste time sure a plot device here and a plot device there keeps you interested this is the second episode in a row where the only actual entertainment is in the last five minutes they end each episode with a giant bomb of an event the problem is i dont even care anymore the hole that kevin costner left in this show has proven to be too big to fill somehow rip is still in it the same amount they should have upped his screen time if taylor sheridian writes himself into one more episode i might actually throw up he isnt a good character
3,this series is so horrific you want to look away but cant i watched an episode and had to stop think about the dark path it leads the viewer on and decide if i really wanted to go that dark i did its a very painful watch some episodes leave you curled up in a fetal position as intended every single cast member is perfect in their roles believable and honestly i dont know how they do something this difficult over and over this show grabs you angers you shocks you but you always end the episodes wanting the next one right away
3,yes its a swing top just like many of the other swing tops retailer is offering this season i find this silhouette unflattering on me being top heavy so i was frustrated to discover the swingness only after i ordered it and it arrived at my house it also runs huge with big gaping arm holes the sleeves are cute and fluttered the black panels on the sides are semisheer it is a pretty boxy top which the photo doesnt seem to capture order at least a size smaller than usual
3,not bad but finger sensor not given
3,iuve been using this for around a week now and iud say itus just a pretty standard shower gel the smell is quite strange it smells like cucumber in the bottle but almost like tea on the skin it is quite gentle on the skin but ultimately iud say itus pretty average this review was collected as part of a promotion
3,love the wear of these jeans but they run small designed holes have grown much largeri dont dryer dry them
3,i have a curvy figure and this top is not for me it fits loose at the top and is tight at the bottom it is also short i think this top works best on slender figures
3,no matter what others say i did like tom cruise as jack reacher in the movies physically he was no way near but he played the character near to perfection alan ritchson has perfected both physically he is very near to the character and also his performance is really up to the mark very engaging and well made series didnt divert a lot from the book making it a perfect adaptation
3,this swimsuit is very well made and even prettier in person im and about pounds i usually wear a size i wear a d bra i found the suit to run a bit small i returned it because despite how much i liked the style it just wasnt flattering on my body type
3,well made but strange fit the medium was long and narrow waaay too small
3,i have never been so addicted to a show like i have with peaky blinders everything is amazing acting from thomasarthuralfie etc all seasons are good i would say the worst one is season but still really good this show also contains relevant facts which make this show even more engaging overall best show no doubt
3,these jeans look slouchy and shorter in the pic which was exactly what i was looking for but they fit more like regular boot cuts on me and proved to be much longer than expected i have fairly long legs and most jeans hit me like they do on the models but these were very long i only buy citizens of humanity and paige jeans and i can almost always buy online for them when it comes to skinny jeans but these did not fit the same as their other styles they are good quality and would probably f
3,nice laptop
3,this is the second sandisk micro sd that ive had to return due to some sort of error i am thinking i just have bad luck and hopefully rd time is the charmduring the time it was working properly it seemed to be quick
3,my only two criticisms of this show are it moves too slow sometimes you waste an entire minute or two watching someone walk from one side of the room to the other i feel bad saying this but the main character played by elizabeth moss is not easy too look at would have been better with a prettier actress other than that i think its really good suspenseful and thought provoking worth watching for sure
3,thought this would be my goto fall dressy sweathsirt it ran smaller than expected and it just didnt have the drapey sweatshirt shape that i prefer the detailing on the arms and waistband is to die for though
3,unfortunately it hit at the widest part of my hips so it wasnt very flattering the point in the back was also kind of odd and off center i had to return pretty color though
3,to me the cornbread is pretty dense and cake like as some of the other reviews mention it is also very sweet too a little too sweet for me good flavor and i dont regret making just not what i look for in my cornbread if i make again ill cut down the amount of sugar if you like your cornbread really sweet and cake like this is the recipe for you
3,it was very difficult to continue watching past first episode but im a hopeless optimist and apparently a masochist im nothing short of devastated by what writers did to addams familys legacy in this series wednesday is mean bratty and malicious in oppose to true wednesday addams who is collected stoic and morbit true addams family is about love this shows addams family is about distrust suppression and conformity i really dont want to use that descriptor but this show is disgusting i and all of my friends are disappointed casting and some of camera work at least is great
3,very good
3,i absolutely loved the first season and had great hopes for the second but this was just so bad reacher waddles around thoughtlessly killing everyone i actually laughed out loud when he ran for the helicopter in the last episode i really hoped the writer who came up with the idea of having the special investigators singing together for an entire incredibly awkward scene is fired before season is subjected to the same amount of cheese more emphasis on the story line and reachers intelligence please and less mindless killing cringey oneliners and protein shakes i just cant fathom how season was allowed to be released
3,it does make the outer edge of the casserole bit crispy on the tortillas when bake for minutes but it is a great time saving recipe if you need dinner on the table fast if you like southwestern food it would be a good recipe to try out i just suggest baking it for or minutes any longer the outer edges of the tortilla will be to crispy
3,i just purchased i th gen gb it is quite slow which was not expected otherwise overall performance is good sound is good build quality is ok ok lagging many times and also came blue dead screen once for me just used for one day
3,battery performance is very week one full charge is coming only hrs only
3,the tag on the jeans said wont stretch out and ive already returned one pair to size down when they stretched out by the end of the first wear ive been wearing the smaller size for a week and its stretching out as well the crotch ends up dropping two or inches and i keep having to hike the pants up in public after just a week of owning them i love paige jeans and the cut and color of these are amazing im going to have to size down one last time just to get them to stay up i hope
3,i think product is good but i am not satisfied with battery backup
3,okay okay type product
3,the controller inside of otter is too chunky and hard i was expecting very soft snuggly toy for nighttime my old throw it out from crib all the time she doesnt like it other than that it works fine
3,the product is of good quality and worth the cost however i am not satisfied with the display it lacks a backlit keyboard but the touchpad is nice ultimately the product has a premium quality appearance
3,this show has very little to do with the original addams family show or the movies from the s i dont know whose wednesday this is but i dont recognize her mannerisms actions nor aesthetic the beauty of the addams family was that it was an eccentric family living in the normal world so choosing to place her in a school for outcasts defeats the whole point what was anyone thinking while making this love jenna ortega as an actress but her face is too conventionally beautiful to be wednesday they should have casted someone with a quirkier look and essence she relied on these genz esque quips to show how eccentric and cold she is television and movies seem to have lost the art of show dont tell catherine zeta jones and luis guzman were so unsexy i dont recognize them as morticia and gomez no chemistry whats with the teen romance being so prominent here in addams family values wednesday and the outcast boy like each other at the end but it was more organic not shoved down our throats from the beginning however aside from this baffling portrayal of wednesday and the family it is a well made show i was able to finish watching the series so if you like teen shows of the s and beyond youll enjoy this i do not like this category so i personally hated this show also it was extremely predictable good luck
3,the witcher season was much better than i was expecting the time jumps can be a little confusing to start but its just the beginning of a great story the actors really nailed their parts cant wait for season i really hope they take their time with this one and dont rush it like another fantasy show whose name we wont mention
3,i originally bought this shirt in the blood orange color which is lovely and vibrant the shirt is extremely comfortable and very flattering however it is also very very cheap after about five washes it has pilled and worn the color has faded a bit and i doubt it will make it through the spring for perspective i wash all my clothes on cold and use the air dry setting on my dryer nonetheless even having experienced the wear and tear i went back and bought this shirt in every other
3,nice fabric very versatile but the knit top and style accentuates your bust probably not an issue for most but if your a d or up its more attention than you may want
3,good but not best
3,way too much liquid i eliminated the last cup of liquid and it was still too thin thickened it up a bit with additional flour amp water slurry prepare all vegies and ingredients ahead of time prep goes fairly fast once it starts
3,i really loved this dress it ran small but it was also shorter than i imagined which was only worsened because im curvier on top would be great for slender figures
3,the product is just ok good for studying not for heavy work at all
3,at first glancewednesday appears to be a very highend glossy production but i am skeptical because i do not see the need to redo the character of wednesday after christina ricci has perfected it in the s then to my surprise christina ricci is part of this cast which implies that she gives her stamp of approval i only know jenna ortega from you in as a bratty mouthy teenager i do not have high hopes but i want to give her a chance and oh yes she delivers ortega should be commended for carrying the show throughout that is not an incidental accomplishment rather an expectation and she easily meets it wednesday is emotionless yet you cannot take your eyes off her face emma myers as enid is also wonderful we find ourselves a couple of young actresses to watch and root for in the future the dialogue here is witty highlighting the biting oneliners uttered by wednesday in rapidfire fashion then we have the beautiful cinematography accompanied by a rich soundtrack the twists and turns are also done well finally a decent show that is both dark and feelgood to come out of netflix dahmer this is not
3,i hope that future tom clancy projects whoever makes the next content with marvels punisher and take note at this this show gives the perfect amount of action with exposition that always keeps me wanting more its good to compare this show to its movie because wow they have done this so much better casting is easily a i mean reacher looks exactly how hes depicted in the books while alan gets a lot of flack for his acting i really dont mind it hes made for action roles and to be honest if you watched any action movie stars in the s alan acting is oscar winning compared to them i love the show this is the type of show that can easily go seasons
3,this vest looked so cute online what you cant see however is the vertical seaming under the arms does not have any fringe about wide that material in the seaming area looked like cheap polyester and it pulled slightly near the side pockets so it didnt lay nicely also the top of the vest where it comes together also does not lay well and it falls awkwardly open again showing the cheapy material that its lined with fits true to size i usually wear a sm in retailer and purchased the
3,product was good but sometimes its lag little bit
3,ive seen many reviews from those who are fans of the novel series and from what ive seen this show stays much truer to the source material than the tom cruise movie versions for that i commend the show writers on this however i do feel that tom cruise did a better job making me believe that he was a former military cop and a brilliant investigator i am a huge fan of alan ritchson ever since i first was introduced to him in blue mountain state he does a wonderful job as jack reacher in this but the show never really shows him as that same kind of investigator and dont write him that way they make him more of a lumbering oaf with some investigative instincts this show made me really think of rambo more so especially with the body count overall i enjoyed binge watching this show and i hope we get a season but with less known actors picking out the villains given who they were really was too easy
3,the movies with tom cruise as reacher just didnt work tiny tom is not reacher alan ritchson looks the way i always pictured reacher there is a ton of action and although some may find ritchsons character a little stoic thats exactly how he is in the books there is a ton of material available with about books in print good dramasaction shows are hard to come by and theres lots to choose from so i certainly hope to see more of these i think with some work this series can be every bit as good as bosch i guess only time will tell cheers
3,i love the idea of this coat and foolishly purchased other items in happy anticipation of its arrival the description does not say lined and i hoped for soft wool that i recently got on the yellow with white piping sweater coat this is hard coarse itchy wool impossible for me to wear an unlined garment i am consistently puzzled by the high prices for garments that are unlined when they really need to be it went back and i cannot really recommend this as i know i am not the only
3,perfectly morbid superb acting throughout and smooth i enjoy anything with jenna ortega is quite talented and shes great as wednesday based on adams family tim burton is masterful at weirdintriguing characters that are excellent to watch the bulk of the time i use other services this is a perfect reason to use netflix i love that this is focused on young folks anything bizarre and beautiful k quality colors quite surprise form tim burton a lot of his projects didnt have much horror mostly scifi adventure and drama wednesday is a pleasant surprise after all the promotions ive seen i highly recommend it
3,i so badly wanted this dress to work for me the material and color is so beautiful this had a sack like fit and the side pockets accentuated my hips giving me a broader look than i would like
3,im actually surprised no one has reviewed this yet i took the plunge because it seemed like a classic wardrobe staple nothing too flashy or fancy that would go well with many outfits my thoughts below __________________ pros fits tts im normally either a or and got the large it fit well and the elastic isnt too tight fit very well for me because i have wider hips so if youre straight or slim you could probably size down exactly as pictured it does have a nice flow
3,when i saw this dress in the store in a size small i usually wear a large i thought how cute so i tried it on it fit very wellall but in the armhole so i decided to order a medium i received the medium and it fits exactly like the small armhole and all in addition i agree with other reviews that this dress description above the knee does not accurately describe length unless youre somewhat tall i found this dress hit me just where id like it toright above the knee not a
3,display is not good with side angle full plastic body
3,its ok for students or beginers display is too dull backlit unavailability hammered the heart build quality is good
3,i want to love this shirt but it isnt happening the proportions shown on the model are not how this shirt ends up fitting the fabric is super soft and the pattern is great if the fit works for you

3,very bland recipe throw some sriracha honey more pepper onion something save this recipe somehow someway
3,ive tried to make soup twice a week this winter amp have tried different recipes so have many to compare this to my only change was to add cloves garlic it was too thin for my taste so after trying it i added cup barley amp recooked the soup until the garlic was done much better it also needed salt amp pepper
3,i thought they at least had a descency to say goodbuy to henrys geralt properly or include some cool action scenes in the last episode nope instead they included some unnecessary annoying characters unneeded scenes and huge plot gaps tissaias character is completely wasted she supposed to be a strong and powerful figure instead she is depicted as a weak teenage girl weeping for some dude yennefer was built as an everpowerful witch in the first season and her character is completely wasted as well suddenly the elves are so powerful while they resembled some homeless tribe during the first two seasons ciri is i dont know what she is overall the only good thing about this tv show was cavill and his representation of a witcher since he is no longer in it i will not watch it
3,having played all the games myself i can say that im familiar with the universe the cast makes little to no sense tris merrigold having no actual red hair yennefer being years younger than geralt etc and the fanbase is complaining although partly agreeing with the mainstream i still found myself enjoying the show the scenery and music fit very well and the world they created gives the feel of the actual witcher universe in my opinion the show could have tremendously benefitted from a slower pace and more time to explain the origins of each character it just feels rushed the highlight is definitely henry cavill who even gets his voice and charisma if geralt has any on point if the main protagonist wasnt that convincing i would have stopped watching after the second episode although an okay start ill be hoping for more the next season
3,delaine blazer so many little details with a slight bit of ruggedness loved the unmatched buttons checkered back and fraying that gave this piece personality making it appear less stuffy easyily dress it up or down that being said it seems to run true to size except the arms and shoulders were very tight i would consider going up a size if more of an athletic build ordered a but i think a would have been perfect
3,this was okay it is very heavy and i wont make it again it tastes like a bowl of queso
3,i love this dress the print and the fabric make it a fun uncomplicated outfit choice that can be dressed up or down very easily that being said there are two issues i wish i had known about although i probably would have purchased anyway it has pockets yay but also the pockets create a bulge where they hit my hips and its not a flattering spot on me to have an extra bulge i washed before wearing because it was super wrinkled and me and the iron arent friends anymore so i thr
3,usually can just buy tiny shirts knowing that they will fit me and this one is beautiful but if you have any type of chest it will not work im a d and it was way too small in the chest area it is a beautiful shirt though and im very sad that i have to return it it will work better on someone else for sure so i recommend this beautiful shirt for someone with a different body type from mine
3,i ordered the blue stripe and white in size large i didnt like it worn off shoulder but it does stay in place which is a good thing and it looks okay worn on the shoulders i find the fabric so uncomfortable and itchy that i couldnt wait to take it off immediately i tried them on again a second time still hopeful with the same outcome sadly returning
3,i was confused by this dress the heavy fabric made me think of winter but the cut and print are springy its also not lined and the material is not exactly soft i put it back cute but missed the mark
3,this sweater is very pretty i love the knit and the cream color for some reason it just didnt flow the way i wanted it to and i didnt love the v neck just didnt pull me in completely
3,i was really excited to receive this dress its a fun concept and different from anything else i have however the dress was way too short on me im ft in and the size medium was way too short given the thin nature of the material i did not feel comfortable keeping the dress even for wearing it outside the office i will have to return this dress
3,laptop hitting problem bettery backup very good but hitting problem touchpad properly work
3,i absolutely loved these pants the first several times i wore them the fit is flattering they are a perfect long length and the colors are stunning after several wears it was time to wash them and i followed the directions provided to wash with cold water and line dry i was initially horrified with the amount that these pants shrunk in fit and length and the colors ran together after a lengthy ironing session i was able to smooth out the material and restore much of the length and fit bu
3,i was so looking forward to trying this recipe but i mustve done something wrong it did not turn out at all and there were definitely no distinct layers as shown in the photo im not sure what happened
3,i really dont get the hype about this i havent played the games but the story of the series is stupid and seems cheap there is no backround to any of the characters or factions an abortion monster really is this a series for the fans of the game books or what is this i really dont get it sorry i tried henry cavill is doing well though
3,i hate to be the only one to not be satisfied with this recipe but it did not turn out it was extremely dense so dense in fact that it was raw and runny in the middle and almost burnt on the outside after an hour in the oven i have no clue what i did wrong i got it to the point of edible in the middle i even made a test batch and added more flower because that was slightly too wet i think it would do best as two small loaves it had a great flavor though and the outside is wonderful i need help to make this right
3,i loved the look of this shirt but when i put it on it was entirely too billowy under the chest it just ended up making me look larger and pregnant
3,i liked the colors and the design but its kind of an odd fabric no give at all and no drape stiff and kind of structured feeling for a casual cardigan the sleeves are extremely narrow and tight i ordered a medium and it felt like a ace bandage squeezing my arms my arms are normal sized if you have exceptionally narrow arms might work for you sending it back
3,not sure if its the card or computer but it only shows up as gig i tried reformating it and everything and it still says gigs
3,quality of the product cheap dont go for i and gen it lags some time battery also not good it come around hrs only body made with cheap plastic
3,i am a huge fan of pilcro pants and was so excited to see them make a pair of vegan leather pants the idea is great leather in the front fully stretchy fabric in the back to give a fitted but comfortable look however i couldnt get past the way the seams and leather felt on my knees really stiff and uncomfortable when you start walking around cant bend the leg all the way weird creasing and bunching behind the knee the fit was perfect everywhere else sadly these had to go back
3,completely underwhelmed with the recipe as written not enough flavor only thing i did differently was add garlic while sauteing the onions i wont be making this again
3,not even close to the best banana bread i followed the recipe verbatim so i didnt add numerous additional ingredients and say i made the recipe as a matter of fact i made a better loaf yesterday using a different recipe that was also called the best banana bread the recipe simply doesnt have enough bananas in it its a nice bread but has limited banana flavor i would suggest looking for a different recipe
3,beautiful sweater coat love that is easy to pop on head out i did have to go to a seamstress and have the button moved as it was to large and boxy around my waist area
3,grew up watching western movies this show has to be one of the best westerndrama tv series of all time great actors great cast all around i get a father lecture from the great kevin costner every episode looking forward to season
3,i wear a size and i ordered the small for this top it is huge and gave me a maternitylook that i wasnt going for i was hoping for a loose bodyskimming fit as shown on the model in the picture but that wasnt happening with this top
3,the dress fits true to size and is pretty comfortable i did look kinda matronly with my d chest its a good basic to have on your closet but i ended up returning the one i bought it didnt feel special enough to keep
3,bad product
3,constant political stuff talked about otherwise its a good show
3,i thought i was getting this nice light weight white sweater but not the case it is a pretty heavy nice thick cotton and beautiful made it does run large i got the small and love the oversize feel even on my frame but it is not white it is beige and it is not light weight i have enough beige sweaters in this look so this one is going back even though it was a great buy on sale
3,if you want deep and meaningful its not neither are the books the action scenes are outstanding overall an enjoyable binge watch could have been a bit tighter say episodes instead of but a totally great show alan richson is exactly how i imagined reacher hope they make more
3,the top falls nicely great quality the lace is beautiful however the sleeves are too wide and puffy the top is voluminous and i wished it had more form fitting sleeves to balance this out the top does not look flattering on me so i will be returning it
3,i didnt realize when i ordered that the hem is unfinished below the seam im not a fan of this look especially in a more expensive skirt the fabric is nice and flowy but i do feel there is maybe too much of itwhich may be a plus if you wanted a fuller skirt and that the waist runs slightly small i am normally a and ordered the large and it fit at my natural waist rather than hanging lower and looser like other styles in this shape i am and i do like fuller skirts but was
3,i bought this for a galaxy note and while it functions properly it is completely useless for my tablet i cant put movies or books on it because they are streamed from google play and i cant put apps on it because that is not allowed why do they put a micro sd slot on a tablet that cant use it for anything but backups backups i might add that are already in the cloud amazon did a great job delivering it which was a bright spot in the realization that i spent dollars on a chip that is going to do a better job cleaning the dirt out of my grout than helping the memory on my tablet
3,this dress looked really nice on the hanger but when i put it on it was shorter than expected i am and it hit way above the knees too short to be a work dress which was what i was hoping might work better on someone shorter
3,super cute toy and very soft i like that you can choose all the setting to personalize the otter like the sounds volume light and so on the only thing i dont love is when you have the belly function on it make sort of a robotic noise and if baby is holding it tightly it makes a clicking noise as it tries to move overall great toy but a little bit pricey for a musical stuffed animal
3,laptop is good i am using since month there is no problem but one thing is this laptop use for normal use not for to hour use because it heat every laptop heating problem but not big problem good in budget
3,i really like the look of these socks and have become obsessed we overtheknee socks for winter this year they are very tick which is nice for keeping warm and for durability for a long lasting product my only complaint is that they are very difficult to get over the knee this can be a great thing because they certainly do stay putwhich is a huge problem with overtheknee socks however by the end of the day i was pretty sure i was going to lose a leg from poor circulation i am still
3,battery issue we are facing an issue with setting up pin for login it keeps coming error
3,the fit is gorgeous but i didnt realize it was completely transparent when it says mesh it means mesh i was thinking the mesh part was on the bottom because of how it is cut high on the shoulders you cant wear a cami underneath to provide coverage very cute but not practical
3,this dress is elegant and really lovely it looks like a throwback to the s and s it drapes nicely and i think it would be flattering on most body types and this is why i am recommending it but be warned it runs large the problem with the dress is that the slip might as well not be there at allit is completely sheer for example i have a couple tattoos and you can see them right through the fabric which is not the look im going for this might be a deal breaker for some for me i
3,i got this top planning to wear it with the sleeves up rather than off the shoulder like in one of the photos my regular size medium was way too large so i went down to a small however the collar was still too wide for the sleeves to stay above my bra straps back it goes if youre looking for a strictly offtheshoulder top you might like it color is deep blue and the cotton is a nice weight
3,if youre so inclined you can read my review of each season of yellowstone logged against the final episode of the season but now that its all over i thought id put something here to sum up my overall feelings john dutton kevin coster is the current custodian of the yellowstone ranch in montana that has been in his family for around years despite their disfunction stemming from the death of matriarch evelyn gretchen mol the dutton family dominate the local area his eldest son lee dave annable is being groomed to take over the ranch jamie wes bentley is the family lawyer and is being prepped for politics beth kelly reilly is a financier and willing to do anything to protect her father only youngest son kayce luke grimes has rejected the life living with his wife nearby having returned from the navy john fights with all the tools at his disposal to keep his land as his enemies conspire against him what i liked was that despite the rhetoric that the show is for a conservative audience its not old time values propaganda being a cowboy frankly looks awful with death and injury a near constant risk and the crushing allconsuming boredom of it is very real there are no real heroes and villains in the show either dan played by danny houston and thomas rainwater played by gil birmingham conspire against john but their whitecollar plotting doesnt match the actual murders committed by people at the yellowstone john in particularly attempts to motivate his children by providing or withholding affection he conspires with and against them and he manipulates local authorities to his benefit it is a melodramatic soap opera at heart though particularly well written by taylor sheridan each episode seems to see some member of the cast dying or being seriously injured or placed in mortal peril its dallas with better production values its an enjoyable time though and one that looks set to continue through its multiple spinoffs
3,i must be one of the rare people that this dress did not work for i adored it online and even on the hanger putting it on it just looked frumpy on me i tried my usual small first decided i must need a smaller size so i sized down to an xs this one looked much better on but was nearly impossible to get in and out of the built in slip got twisted and i had to start over twice i decided i wasnt willing to work up a sweat getting dressed and undressed when i wore it i passed
3,i followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down however the jacket was still too large it fit fine in the arms but the bodywidth of the jacket was huge also i found the wool material to be extremely itchy it might work if you are layering it over long sleeves but still make sure to size down at least one or maybe even two sizes
3,these pants are really beautiful the material feels nice and i love the pull on style however they are much too long for me im and they literally hang to my ankles which is not at all flattering like the photos i think if you are tall enough these are a wonderful piece
3,i love the fabric and design of these leggings but unfortunately they ran way to big up top they literally fall down
3,i just tried on this dress in the store in red and i loved the off the shoulder design the color is just as pictured online a light poppy red the neckline began a few inches below my collarbone and was super flattering however the skirt portion of this dress flared awkwardly at the hips causing my hips to look much wider than they really are and also disturbing the otherwise clean lines of the dress it seemed to me that there was too much fabric at the back portion of the skirt than
3,i watched episodes and still theres no clear gaol to the story because its collection of short stories i got confused so many time watching this maybe the novel fans love this but not for me it feels like short cheap films put together of course as usual netflix had to involve politics even in fantasy show as a guy who played the game i can say that this show definitely doesnt have the feel of the amazing world of the witcher like every netflix adaptation it feels like cheap copy
3,im giving it a to offset some of the orchestrated bad reviews here good grief quit taking these kind of shows so serious i find it very entertaining and yes im a real person not paid by the show yikes people
3,beautiful detail soft drapey fabric but it pulls funny from where they added stitching at the top of the v for me it was also a little short but i have a long torso im lbs and the size medium fit nicely with the exception of the length
3,my laptop frame got detached a little bit in the hinge region out of no where
3,as the title says most of the bad reviews ive seen talk about westernizing the books and games and as a matter of fact i think it should be westernized as much as you loved the books and the games think about the people that havent why should they make the show specifically to those who read the books andor played the games obviously they want to bring in and target a wider audience to this series and when i see people talking about triss who cares about hair color and even in the books it is described as kasztanowe which means chestnut i dont find chestnuts so incredibly red as in the game its more of a brownish color with a pinch of red as i would to see it people who only played the games might find this a bit problematic but they didnt go far from the books and then come people who bring race into these kind of things never did the author mention there were no black elfs in the continent which is where the series and action takes place it isnt medieval poland which some people think of it its a whole new fantasy world thats the thing about fantasies if the author of the book did literally say there were only white people here it wouldve of made sense but he didnt stop comparing it to the smallest details oh triss had red hair she didnt the game producers butchered it watch the show for what it is and think about the people that havent heard about this universe at all that being said there was a slight possibility to give the just because it would be hard for people that dont know anything and havent played the games andor read the books to know what is going on i would much have preferred the first episode to talk about this universe and get people going but i chose a because after episodes you somewhat know what kind of universe it is who are witchers why were they needed etc
3,this top may be right for some but it did not work for me ive been looking for a nice black top and loved the flutter sleeves on this one however it didnt do much to flatter my body i ordered the xl but it was huge im not sure a l would have solved my problems if it had been available i found it looked boxy and and agree that the arm holes are too big the quality is great and style so pretty though i wish it had worked for me
3,the series sometimes catched me but it was too hard to trust in the witcher as the story and the characters seems to me too arranged there are no wow situations its something that you can watch while you do something else fastfood lets say this peace of series is worth watching if you like fantasy in a cheesy and boring way with costumes that looks too clean for middle age with settings that might be in a childrens dream with a storyline thats boring the parallels to game of thrones are obvious but no thrill too flat
3,most boring show ever stay away the main actress she looks and the acting is horrible i saw the movie and loved itbut this show is horrible
3,i knew i was going to like this reincarnated version of charles addams story of wednesday during the series first episode when jenna ortega as the titular teen states i find social media to be a soulsucking void of meaningless affirmation shell get no argument from me on that point apparently and i hadnt known this tim burton was the director originally attached as they say in the business known as show to the addams family movies but couldnt make it work with his batman movies postproduction schedules i dont know if the eventual director barry sonnenfeld was responsible for the original casting of christina ricci or if burton had a role he would use her in later films like sleepy hollow but the young actress created a memorable if not iconic character in two films and she gets a nice if light supporting role here so why this series well its now literally a new generation with an updated sense of cynicism and sarcasm plus weve got to give tim burton his time at bat dont we he doesnt disappoint and neither does jenna ortegas turn in the role of wednesday full of woe addams i refer you to the dance scene in episode four memorable once again if i could award halfs then the series would be stars
3,the design of this dress is very cute but if you have an average to large bust dont even think about it returned unfortunately
3,everything is good but speakers is very very worst
3,i want my bread to look like the one in the picture mine wasnt golden brown but ill try it again
3,the package arrived on time its very well packed and its got an adapter it works perfectly with my phone though it doesnt allow a computer format once its been on the phone so it asks you to erase everything before you use it on a computer so if youre planning on buying this for different purposes and devices gotta be aware of this i just need for my phone so i transfer files with my usb cable that works just right i also give it a star because it says there are gb but even when its totally formatted it only reaches to gbsooo i dont know where my other gb areanyways overall its working well i do think its expensive for what it is
3,i tried on the grey version in store and it was significantly longer than pictured the back came down to just below my knee which looked awkward with the split sides i am and this was a regular not petite size however the overall quality of the fabric was good and it seemed durable
3,worst laptop waste money high heating issue hanging problem
3,i really really wanted to love this jacket unfortunately i have a long torso and it was a weird length on me it hit touching my waist and i wanted something a little longer i am but long waisted this probably fits beautifully on someone more shortwaisted or petite in stature it was beautiful although the buttons were cheap
3,if you look closely at the pattern it is a giant triangle running across the front of your body this doesnt do great things really if you have more of an hourglass shape or small waist it completely removed the idea that you have a small waist and draws attention to the area of the triangle that is the largest also i agree with another reviewer about being cautious about buttons as several were off some of the dresses
3,im not exactly sure where to start but great performances a solid cast and a story that seems aimless at first yet is executed perfectly to keep you entertained until the very last minute i decided to watch this series from start to finish because of the hype around the release of the third season and i definitely dont regret it this show tells the story of rich people going on vacation to a luxury hotelwhether as a family with their partner or with their kids it has a spicy edge and a storyline where some characters appear to embody the seven deadly sins the acting is incredible from most of the cast many of them already wellknown and the show has a really strong hook i recommend watching this series from beginning to end because its hard to explain exactly what makes it so good but it has something you dont see in many shows give it a chance and youll find yourself laughing feeling some serious cringe from certain moments and getting hit with some great plot twists season one good season two perfect season three even better than the first
3,finally a character like the books this is the guy i saw in my mind when i was reading the books and bad guys we can get excited about the whole series was binged in a weekend great stuff cant wait for season
3,why does everything have to have a spicy kick there are tons of people who cannot tolerate this the same goes for the tv food channels
3,this immediately caught my eye in the neutral pattern and the fabric is actually quite nice the fit is at least a size or two too large though with the bust being way too large for me even sizing down my normal was big everywhere and the was still big in the chest but fit everywhere else the belt is handy for cinching in some of the loose areas but the top section just didnt work for me maybe better for someone better endowed
3,its okay to buy but there is battery draining problem
3,this dress is very cute and is made well i bought up a size from what i usually where as one reviewer mentioned the dress is small in the bust this is always a problem for me therefore i ordered a i was surprised that the was sung in the bust and then understood why the was sold out i was lbs heavier when i wore a never would have thought id have to order up that high ive been running a or depending on the level of my activity im keeping the dress because i kn
3,i wanted to love this shirt but it quickly lost shape and a hole was created in the middle of the shirt after just a few washes not worth the price poorly made you need to wear a shirt underneath bc it is so thin the shirt looks better int he picture i like it but it wears terribly
3,i love this top but i washed it once in cold water and hung it dry it shrunk just enough that its now too tight around the bust and gaps open up between buttons there so disappointing i will have to send it back
3,this sweatshirt is very comfortable and the length of the sleeves is very generous the bodice is short so you may have to wear a camisole or tank top to avoid exposing your tummy i usually purchase medium sized tops but had to return for an xl this runs very small
3,the description of this plush has sold of the dream and unfortunately i have been very on it it is not at all convenient to use to change modemusical to white noise you have to unscratch the opening behind it is the same to increase or decrease the volume and intensity of the brightness the sound or imitation of snoring the sound of the mechanism is not pleasant for the texture it does not have to say anything again it is very soft to the touch
3,dont buy this because of two gb ram adds more money if you want to extend to gb then two gb rams go waste waste of money
3,good soup needs zip
3,this is a comfortable sweater dress and the quality of the material seems good the solid blue strip down the front makes it look very bland i think it would need some dressing up with a necklace or scarf i decided to pass
3,with wednesday adams rage of being introduced to the school where the parents met she later finds herself wanting to know more about the past and dark secrets of the school getting in trouble with the principal or headmistress of the academy questioning her parents and having suspensions her hunger to know more feeds within her as in piece by piece she finds the missing puzzle but with full evidence episodes occur within this place to keep secrets hidden she leaves the place with only puzzle unsolved a mysterious movie with a i wanna know more ending enjoy the creepy hairraising experience of wednesday
3,not working as well as expect some times it lag i am purchase it only on days use battery performance very poor full charge can only hours backup overally not good laptop as compared to others with same price
3,fabric was a little more shear than i thought it would be while not a big deal it was missing a few of the silver beads along the front line of the top returned
3,thought id love this top im a sucker for lace anything from retailer but i found the lace while pretty to be quite rough which to me indicates a lower quality and i guess i shouldve known that it would be very swingy photos show that but it really overwhelmed me for reference lbs d sad but this went back
3,first of all the colors are really pretty fabrics feel really nice but the fit was no bueno i think if you are tall and small chested this dress would look great but im short and large chested and it was very unflattering when the fabric transitions from the stripes to solid it doesnt hang nicely due to my chest sadly this is a return for me
3,iv bought loads of these on offer used washing with half a cap and i cant small much i do have a good sense of smell by the way description says put a drop like wtf you need a cap full so now i dont think it willbe wash after all
3,i was not a fan cute design but the sweater was not soft it felt thick like a weird blanket the arms were small and the body was big odd combo the material didnt make me want to put it on it went back
3,i ordered a large and it was skin tight if thats the look youre going for
3,bought it on sale and i am keeping it it is well made an the material seems to be of good quality however i believe this would be more flattering on someone less curvy less hips smaller bust as it makes me look slightly pregnant still i am keeping it to use on those days i just dont feel like dressing up for work i bought a large im a c but i think i couldve gotten away with a medium
3,out of overall after a for season for season and for season season finds about different groups looking for ciri different kingdoms who are at war with each other and elves who are at war with at least one of the kingdoms or maybe humans in general not sure and mages who i think are secretly at war with all of the kingdoms there are at least or characters in each group were supposed to care about so many names just way too much to keep track of ruining the enjoyment of the show its like they decided they needed to change the witcher into game of thrones geralt himself seems to barely be in it and when he is he is just brooding he fights a few monsters but you dont find yourself caring much since you know hell do a few dramatic sword swipes and itll be over im only on the third episode but im struggling to continue sadly its just boring due to there being so much i dont want to care about
3,a hodgepodge of movie echos and cliches i started out watching the first episode of this show with high hopes for a solid new and innovating scifi adventure in comparison to the classic star wars boy was i disappointed even to a point that i wanted to hit the stop button already after minutes in the first episode all the cliches of american movie making seemed to be put in this show an overly done western b movie using cliches that have been used a trillion times only this time not with cowboys mexicans using gatling guns and horses but with people in halloween costumes and makeup and not horses but eh well i dont even care how this super wild thing was called the main character could tame with the cliché words easy boy etc i forced myself to watch this first episode till the end but if this is what american film making nowadays has come to using the faint echoes of outstanding movies with actors like clint eastwood and milking out the only part of history america seems to be proud of namely the wild west era then lets turn our heads to asia where new ideas and innovating movie making is still possible i really dont understand and i definitely dont believe that america also is not packed with innovating young film makers but what hits the big screens is movies on a childrens level using themes that have been used way way way too much and numb the audience with endless repetition of movie cliches totally nothing refreshing but spreading a fog of boredom that numbs you i didnt bother to start the second episode and started to watch a korean mini series called the witchs diner which in its simple lightness has way more value and knows how to get real acting and messages across better than these hundreds of millions costing carnivalesque dressed up hodgepodge of movie echos and cliches america what happened to your innovating role in the movie world
3,i literally created an account just to leave this reviewi dont understand the hype for this teen drama cringe rubbish i was excited to start this show and after a few episodes in i cant understand the hype for this generic show i really wanted to enjoy the show and maybe i set expectations high after seeing reviews online and all the hype around the show but i found myself to be just cringing at every episode whilst finding none of the characters interesting it feels just the same as the new sabrina the teenage which show but tbh i found that to be better than this even i found thing to be the most interesting character and thats just a hand
3,i am with curvy muscular body and ddd boobs the ruffle ends up hitting me right below my breasts and creates the look of being about months pregnant the beading is beautiful and i wish that it fit
3,the worst acting ever put on screen the legendary adventures of hercules should get an oscar in comparison to this
3,beautiful scenery intriguing storyline fantastic cast
3,these are a wonderful trouser style pant i love fitted than flared denim so this fit isnt my top pick but its a cute style thick quality denim fabric with a medium rise cut
3,love the cut and the way they drape size and lbs fit great until you wear them for an hour all of a sudden my s became s they were practically falling off i plan to wash them to see if they shrink i wish they held their shape since they are so cute
3,worst display dead pixels not at all a ips display
3,nyc and portable design
3,the style of this dress is quite lovely i immediately gravitated towards it when i saw in the store however once i tried it on it looked like a sack of potatoesunfortunately the loose silhouette did not do anything for my figure i should mention that i am and have an athletic figure but with hips the design is very on trend and the dress does have some lovely details like the lace around the hip area and flowy fabric but unfortunately it was not enough for me to purchase also the
3,i make my scalloped potatoes with cream of mushroom or a cream soup of any kind i cut the soup with can milk the soup gives it much flavor and no need to make a white sauce its a lot easier and delicious
3,season one was like apple pie smelled different a lot different from dallas and way better in episodes season wow continued to be just as great and then some the cast is amazing and have to say danny huston should have gotten some award the guy would never back down and showed class when he eventually bought it luke kelly cole and jefferson very realistic portrayals of everyday people the rest of the cast fine acting kevin gil wes all did a fine job
3,i think the difference in results may be due to how ripe the peaches may have been lots of juice as you slice cut the extra fluid down accordingly
3,im and i think fairly proportioned lbs b and the peplum hit well above my waist since having kids im a little obsessive about avoiding any shirt that could double as maternity and this struck me as one its a cute too but once its on i dont feel its very flattering
3,performance is no good
3,frumpy is the word i would use to describe this top i look good in empire waist shirts and seek them out but this one made me look pregnant and frumpy and it has an attached camisole but the sheerness of the top still showed my nudecolored bra strap so i dont even know what to wear under it its going back even with the sale price
3,cringe and dissapointing first of allwednesday was not evil person and never killed anyone yes whole addams family is weird and morbid but they were never killers i didnt like that touch when she puts pirranah in the pool first of allwhere did she find pirranah for the fcks sake second of allgomez really bothers mehe looks like homeless man they picked up on street and asked to play the part in this tv show of course there is school like hogwarts and of course wednesday roomate will be completely opposite of her and shes so cringe i cant morticia is fine in my opionion but everything else bothers me siren wearing contact i can see that from the airplane the whole show is cringe and monoloque is just made for teens or something
3,super salty next time i will not add the salt the recipe calls for and ill also use no salt added tomato sauce and paste i think minus the over salty taste this would be really good
3,seems watered down
3,i love the style of this dress but unfortunately it runs very small i normally wear a size i ordered a and the dress was closer to a size disappointed that i had to return it also the seams were poorly done and threads hung out everywhere on the hem
3,i join the long list of customers who have had their sandisk die on them customer service from sandisk has been helpful they pay for ups shipping for the return and promise a day turn around once the defective disk has been returned still its a pain to deal with and i lost some photographsupdate sandisk sent me a replacement and it seems to be working if the replacement goes bad ill be back to complainsecond update all is well with the replacement so im giving it three stars
3,finally a proper jack reacher and although having nick santora show running this the fact reamains it is a very good adaptation of the first reacher novel and it follows lee child vision fairly well i hope this is the beginning of a two digit seasons
3,im a pretty solid these days and had no trouble fitting into other size dresses at the store the large was so tight around my hips i barely got it on they didnt have an xl to try on but i cant imagine i would have fit in it so if you have wide hips this is not the dress for you it fit fine on top in the l it was just so tight in the hips that it did not lay nicely
3,there are some issue with the trackpad it is not that responsive as it should be charging cable quality is bad
3,this jacket is beautiful the color is so nice and the cut of the jacket is perfect however one i put it on i couldnt wait to get it off its so itchy i tried putting on a long sleeve shirt under it but was still uncomfortable especially around my neck i wouldnt recommend this jacket based on the material alone also the jacket runs large im lbs d and i ordered the small i would definitely size down
3,they hit it out of the ballpark with this one it brings a perfect mix of dark comedy drama and effortlessly depicts a modern character of wednesday without cringe or emphasis on the types of biased agendas were normally bombarded with when we seek to be entertained i appreciate that homage was paid to the original character of wednesday too i also must say i watched stranger things as well yet i never grasped the full love of it as everyone else seems to have done this was definitely a more fun watch for me the whole cast and ensemble is terrific the gorgeous catherine zeta jones as morticia is spectacular and my favorite character out of the whole show is thing never in my life did i think i would fall in love with a freaking hand as a character but its happened

3,tried the navy in store boy does it run big im normally a size small ish a the xs was still quite boxy on me while the sleeves were well fitted i understand this is the style and i like the design with the different sleeves it was a no buy as the main fabric was already pilling in store and looked a bit cheap sorry
3,i really lived the detail fabric and quality of this tank however the sizing seemed disproportionate it was tight through the bust and loose the waist i really loved all the colors i purchased online but had to return them because of the sizing
3,too cute very fast delivery i only put stars because the otter came dirty
3,unfortunately i had to size down twice with there pants great feel theyre soft and the grey is a soft color
3,id recommend getting this top but only after understanding its limitations its beautiful and i bought it even after reading the other critical and accurate reviews because i so loved how it paired with the skirt unless you size down the rigid form of the embellished straps will lie funny and the rest of the top fits bizarrely as it is both short it could almost expose the bottom of your stomach and has lots of fabric so it almost flows out all around you accentuating your stomach and ma
3,loved the style ordered my normal m fit tts though i thought i would potentially taper the sides to make less boxy with a larger bust and shoulders boxiness is unflattering the slight boxiness looked perfect with stretchy fitted business slacks midday i held my ipad up to my chest and the velcro from the cover pulled an entire lychnis delicate threads not just snagged i had to gently separate the threads from velcro grip needless to say it pulled the threads out by at least an i
3,i love the first season now im not even sure i just want to point out one thing being a texan who was born here and lived here my entire life no one and i mean no one talks like tater teeter here or any where no one says bar meaning beer if anything it would be bayer it is the worst maid up fairy land accent ever at best there could be one person who talks like this in texas and theyre probably not from here either way its ridiculous and stupid that a writer director puts this joke of an accent in his show as if it represents the way even a small group of texans may speak when none of us do and he knows it teeter is a cartoon character along with the exaggeration of beth who could dial it back a bit i know its all fantasy but this show is built on making it feel like an authentic modern western and its failing pretty hard in my opinion
3,im lbs and the small fits perfectly the sleeves are the right length i have long arms and legs and the body fits loosely without looking sloppy at my height the small is not long enough to wear as a tunic which is fine unfortunately the shirt arrived with makeup stains around the laces and the inside of the shirt so i had to wash it before wearing it i only purchased this shirt because it was on sale
3,way too sweet too many chips in each cookie too much sugar then added sugar from the puddingjust too much for me
3,i thought this tank would be so cute and comfy for my daily walks but its completely see through i sized down one size based on a review from another website and it fits ok but its hard to say if it runs tts because i have nothing to compare it to if the fabric was a little thicker this would be the perfect tank unless your planning on layering this i wouldnt recommend
3,love the colors and design however the sweather is much boxier than what the photo shows and it is itchy i am still deciding as it might be fine with a shirt worn underneath it
3,the show is ok its build right the plot is like every deactivate show with kids i dont really get a lot of things in the shows the best example is the building of the cearchters in the show the process is too fast and there is not deepness i think the show was in one derction and suddenly its changed very fast to another story line that we didnt really intereste to see the writers try to explain the story in the best way they could but in the way they forgot lot of important thing i have to say i was impressed by the beginning of the show but suddenly its all changed i think this is the next riverdale and if the shoe wants to seccsed the writers got think wildly and more creative about the next seasons
3,wow this runs small im thinking the accidentally sent me an xxs
3,another shirt i really wanted to love i adore green but so few tops are made in this color please make more however this shirt didnt work for me i think its a matter of where your curves live the shirt was true to size but my boobs meant i was showing more cleavage than the model and the top part felt more like a bib than embroidery sad coz it is lovely and feels lovely on probably a great shirt for different body types would love to see more green clothing
3,i have a mixed feeling about this cardigan on one hand i like it on the other hand there are some minor things i do not like first i love its knit pattern especially the pattern on the back second i like a soft color of this cardigan on website pictures two motifs look almost the same in reality brown motif is light pinkish while blue motif is light bluegreenish third texture this cardigan is made of linen and cotton so it feels comfortable to wear if there are flaws
3,i love the design of this tunic it is sewn well but the fabric is cheap i disliked the texture of the fabric so much that i returned it
3,very good consistency and easy to make but i think it needs more clam flavor i will substitute another bottle of clam juice for the water if i make it again and add more clams
3,first of all this top runs big im and there was still plenty of room to spare in an extra small this is a cute top but i returned it because it was too stiff and boxy for me the fabric is thicker than your average tee and theres not much give so it may not hang well on all body types i might revisit it if it goes on sale because i like the design with the small details at the sides but this was an easy pass for me at the regular price
3,look this show is basically xenahercules in more ways than one but with a much less consistent and thoughtful narrative coupled with very jarring jumps in the timeline that makes it really hard to follow and understand certain character choices motivations and their overall development yet i love it its fast food but a very tasty one the show is simply so much fun it knows when to and when not to take itself seriously henry cavill is amazing as geralt and simply chews every scene he is in geralts sidekick jaskier played by joey batey is also brilliant he brings an inredibly amount of energy and fun to every scene he is in the show works the best when these two characters are on the screen together and they are the main reasons to watch the witcher the dynamic between these two charactersactors are simply fantastic their friendly connection reminds me of some of the best movie duos like riggs and murtaugh from lethal weapon i definitely recommend watching the witcher while its nowhere near as cleverly written in terms of story and characters as the really popular the witcher iii the wild hunt video game it manages to make up for it in certain ways and its one of the most fun shows going on right now
3,this sweater is fine for the casual days i bought this in cream and i have to say after one wash it looks old im a huge retailer lover and buy a lot of clothes from them this is just not the best quality and looks tired after a few wears very soft but poor material not my favorite purchase
3,looks great from the front but from the side it looks like a maternity top
3,i made the bread following the directions the bread turned out well light and with a nice height however it tasted very bland to me wish i had added some cinnamon or nutmeg to give it some spunk
3,body not good as well as dellhp
3,while i loved the material color and concept of the dress it was much too large and sacklike im and lbs pearshaped i purchased the regular xs given stated length in the description while the length was just right it was just much too large throughout im not sure that even an xxs will help so sadly this will be going back
3,this top is beautiful but the fabric is really stiff and itchy in addition its rather cropped or short the real disaster and heart break for me was when i washed it the tag recommends dry cleaning but allows for hand washing i should have dry cleaned it shrunk even more when i washed it on delicate setting in cold too bad because this looks so cute the first time you wear it if youre up for a dry cleaning bill and dont mind a little stiff scratchy material youll be fine buying t
3,compelling and horrifying beautiful music by adam taylor every scene is beautifully directed topclass acting by elisabeth moss and ann dowd the handmaids tale might feel like a dystopian future world but atwood said that nothing that happens in the book didnt happen before somewhere in the real world this fact makes the show extra harrowing
3,the handmaids tale on hulu is more frightening than anything stephen king has ever written margaret atwoods novel is distressing but the television series on hulu is terrifying ive just finished the second season of the series and two more seasons have already been shown a fifth season will start soon and there are rumors that a sixth will follow the novel is a little over pages the hulu series has already quintupled that with nearly hours worth of exposition the television presentation goes well beyond what atwood was able to pack into pages i dont sleep well after watching episodes from this series because i fear that the united states is heading toward becoming gilead
3,smells awesome cant wait to try it thats was great i tripled the recipe so there was decent amount of sauce i think boneless would end up dry just dont eat the skin
3,very disappointed about the batterydrained quickly and backup only maximum and half hour display is ips but the refresh rate is hz only
3,this sweater looks soft and flowy on the model but in the store it is rather stiff lace in the back and very plain in the front i did not like the ribbing on the front bottom of the sweater because it pulled in places and didnt lie flat way too expensive for what you are getting
3,i love this dress and had so hoped to wear it to a wedding in june the fabric is a perfect weight very nice cotton i only wish i could have kept it i am lbs and usually wear a size which is what i ordered it was fine in the skirt but the top was at least a size if not two sizes too small for chest i did not want to wear it open with a tee and so had to send it back the wedding date does not allow for the new available date for the dress
3,ok ok lap
3,if you do not pay attention you might get lost in the chronology of the events a lot of people did not get this and found it confusing for sure i think they should have clarified it it was very easy to do everything they needed was to put a sign saying x time ago and thats it other than that this show has everything to become great
3,i tried this on in the store i tried regular medium which was way too big except in the chest where it was really tight the material was a little itchy on me but maybe its because the chest was tight the color is lovely pink im sure someone will love it but if you are petite i would order the petite and maybe size up if you are busty
3,was so sad for this show to end funny irreverent and great casting everyone was perfect literally
3,when you think that totalitarianismfascism and christian church cant go together remember general francos spain ok america is different because of whole spectrum of christian denominations and different ethnic groups but idea is plausible in homogeneous country with just one nation and one dominant religious group
3,as an enthusiast gamer who has played last of us and and an avid watcher of tv shows the show has been as per my expectations so far however nikolaj costerwaldau could have been a better option for the portrayal of joels character anyhow hoping for a thrilling series ahead the last of us subverts narrative expectations for its specific genre by straying away from focusing on survival though the characters clearly want to stay alive the series does not concern itself with heavily focusing on joel and ellies conflicts with others theyre there of course but thats not what this series is about these episodes are about the relationship that is formed between joel and ellie two people separated by generation and bound by necessity as they travel across the dangerous landscape that the united states has become they must not only deal with the infected the cannibalistic funguscovered monsters but also the deadly people that have been forged by the new world everyone joel and ellie come into contact with have their own distinct motivations for their actions leaving the audience to decide their own beliefs on the morality of these decisions the last of us might not be as graphic as the video game its adapted from but that makes it no less intense there are shocking moments of violence that should be expected from a world like this such as graphic cannibalistic deaths from infected or more emotional deaths of younger survivors that isnt to say the series doesnt have its lighter moments as there are brief moments of levity peppered throughout the season especially moments involving the relationship between joel and ellie and the jokes they share
3,the otter switches off directly again and the breathing movement no longer works in addition the light flickered if it worked when the otter didnt cause any problems unfortunately the product was not bought directly via amazon so i dont get it replaced must now send it back and buy it again but is now euros more expensive very a pity
3,it works but file writes are a bit slower than expected on a usb readeralso both reads and writes are faster with the card inside the standardsize sd adapter mbs vs write mbs vs mbs read on the same card reader cant figure why
3,i thought i would take a chance even though reviews suggested tricky sizing issues unfortunately its true it was very tight at the waist and bust even though i sized up to a size i took it back to the store
3,the arm slits are actually subtle and dont gape open the chiffon type pleats are lovely but the cotton material they overlay appears cheap and isnt dressy enough for my work
3,not oled display
3,they are ok not todiefor easy enough that i may make again but other desserts outshine these in tastea little heavy on the almond extract turn out well if prepared exactly as directions say but need to bake longer in the oven
3,so much sound and wifi network connection issue the even tooth stable wifi and internet connection it gives pathetic network issue always up and down in few seconds sound and network issue got fixed with automatic driver update but later found bluetooth doesnt work even with bluetooth phone
3,i had high hopes for this top as it looked great online unfortunately it was much more ruffly in person and not my style at all it was a lot of fabric and poofed out too much reminded me of a childs top sad to return it
3,review after approx mth of usage the only cons battery life not more than hr display is not good while turning sideways it turns black speaker low volume performance is good enough at this price
3,loved this top on model even happier when it went on sale sort of boxy but still excited then within one day there was hole already in the thin tee fabric disappointed my other tees i purchased are fine
3,as a huge fan of the reacher books i was really excited to see this series i thoroughly enjoyed the tom cruise movies its a testament to cruises talent that he could make it work despite being nothing like the the stature of the character now of course alan ritchson has the physique and menace of the character and he does a pretty good job on the acting front id like to see more in the next series though ritchson is a bit one dimensional i dont know if the director and writer wanted it that way but without more depth to the performance it wont hold the attention for too many more seasons and that would be a real shame over all i thoroughly enjoyed this and the supporting performances were superb
3,was a bit too fluffyi prefer a more substantial pie but the taste was good
3,its been a while to find it after the vanity project from tom cruise a the ft man mountain with a chest played by a ft guy never made any sense this however is a much better depiction alan richson manages to tread the fine line between violent psycho and moral crusader he embodies the reacher role the story is fast paced with some really decent acting and great action scenes its rare that you watch a series and you try to out off watching the last ep because you want to savour it willa fitzgerald does a great job of playing the tough cop in a male dominated world with a softer side and malcolm goodwin is always good in everything hes done that i have seen bring on s
3,a simple yet interesting murder mystery series with some good fantasy and teen drama stuff series was inspired from the old show the addams family main positive of the series was characters and its characterisation especially wednesday addams jenna ortega as wednesday was impressive and nailed it other cast did a great job and well supported to their respective characters series gave me harry potter kinda vibe murder investigation was simple but that part was well written and never makes is bore except for the clumsy rd act in finale episode series had good direction and good production value visuals were great overall an entertaining fantasy investigation teen drama to watch if you like to watch harry potter kinda content then definitely give a try
3,the fit once you get it on is as flattering as can be its beautiful quality is undeniable the problem and its a big oneyou cant get it on without destroying your nails the beautiful little buttons running up the bodice are impossible to get done and undone dear designer you forgot the zipper sincerely women everywhere i loved it so much but just couldnt buy an outfit that was going to take me minutes to put on and since it is a jumper it would be a process throughout wearing
3,pros look and feel is good cons sound is very low cause speakers are present in the down part cam quality also not up to mark for ssd usable space is only gb for office and students regular work purposes its good even for entertainment purposes gaming and editing is not a good pick
3,started out as an interesting and tense take on a dark comedy and then it soon became clear that the creators werent entirely sure of the tone they were going for odd juxtaposition of establishing shots building score and often mundane dialogue different is good but not at the detriment of substance wouldve been a better film if it leaned into the thriller aspects or the black comedy but struggles to balance both and the disappointing finale shoehorns the character development that was missing from the the rest of the season i think its worth a watch but if you start to feel like your attention is waning its a good point to stop theres no unfurling mystery with a nice payoff i actually forgot about whats hinted in the first scene
3,i love the colors in this top but sadly im going to have to return it the first thing my husband did when he saw this on me was just stare and not in a good way then he said it looked like a maternity top i was so disappointed and sadly will be returning this for reference i am pounds ft in tall and do not want to look pregnant in a top i normally wear size medium tops but this one is huge now i know why the model in the picture had her arms nestled in at her sides this to
3,honestly the sweater is really beautifuli usually buy a small in retailer tops and this seemed to run on the smaller side its pretty short but the issue i have is that the sleeves are much shorter in person than on the models in the pictures it looks like im wearing a sleeve shirt still deciding if im going to keep it because it is really a lovely top
3,best and good display built quality appritiate and classic
3,if you like looking like a giant square and hide things this is the way to go for me it completely irradiates my shape including my neck this will be returned
3,at the beginning of summer i first ordered one of these tops in size xl i liked the colors and the material was such a soft open weave i thought it would be perfect for the hot weather so i ordered a nd on sale unfortunately even though these are made of mesh these tops ended up being really hot i wore them in texas new york new jersey and florida i thought theyd be a good pretty choice but the material with the gathered waist wrists trapped in the heat it was just too sheer
3,this show is absolutely amazing it leaves you wanting more and more only bad thing is the seasons are short
3,this review is for season the show had a great start action mystery somewhat of interesting characters after a few episodes in it got to be very typical a big braun guy with brains who seems to know way too much information about people that he hardly knows action sequences are pretty well done but very repetitive theres also the situation whenever a maine and character is about to get murdered they have to get that explanation of why its happening then they miraculously get out of it theres no real chemistry between any of the characters either they seem to play like theyre in two different shows this even a little bit of a love interest there but nothing exciting
3,i am only giving this product stars becuse i purchased this one as a replacement for a sandisk micro sd card that kept having problems with i finally got tired of losing my data and ponied up the odd dollars to just replace the darn thing
3,this dress is a good casual summer dress the material is thin and feels nice on the dress was very wrinkled when it arrived but that came out very easily and the fabric doesnt really wrinkle easily after initial wash and steam the color is very vibrant and the fit is loose however if you have a larger chest im a c the hook and eye closure dones come undone overall a good purchase it looks good with a belt as well
3,i am just doing set up now dont know about performance and all but its very classy this is my first laptop lets see how it goes
3,one of the most gripping tv series i think ive seen its been done so well you cant take your eyes off the screen and youre either shouting at the screen or gasping because of what youre watching truly brilliant
3,its switch off suddenly on runing time
3,i agree with those who thought this material looked a little cheap i ordered the white knowing about the sleeves and thought id like the slits but the material sleeves definitely gave an undesired pirate vibe true to size
3,i wanted to love these because they are so pretty and come in lots of colors but after only a few minutes of wearing them i was having to pull them out of my bottom why does womens underwear so frequently ride up i normally wear a size and ordered these in a m but i guess they were still too small which seems unreasonable to me they are soft and pretty but i will not be ordering more
3,this top was so pretty online unfortunately it did not work for me the front was a bit more shapeless in person though the back was gorgeous with a button gather at center the color appeared yellow online but was a bit more green in person also the armholes were very low so it would need a camisole or no bra
3,gosh this is beautiful but it is way wider and puffer than i imagined it would be in fact it almost looks like a costume or something you would buy handmade i would just feel silly wearing this out to dinner with a group of friends i gave it high ratings on the quality however because it really is beautiful but the design is just not what i had hoped for
3,laptop is good but battery should be improved or performance in gta only get fps on high settings
3,the fabric of this dress feels like suede i couldnt stop touching it here comes the but the dress is cut straight down no definition the rosette lace is sewn on like an afterthought just to make the dress not to look plain or cheap i tried it on with a belt and by itself and i still feel like its just a plain dress that i can get at a discount store im a big fan of tracey reese and own a lot of her dresses and i feel that this is the most plain dress she ever designed size s regu
3,henry cavill wow man what accurate selection bfor geralt i have not read the books i have only played about hours of the game i dont know if that makes me a fan we imagine the world of geralt de rivia in our own way and perhaps the screen writers of the series do not do what is necessary to satisfy us but this friends is the best series of this year without a doubt it lives up to got i am anxious for the second season
3,i was excited to try this on in the store today the zipper details on the shoulder are really cute and the ribbing pattern is flattering i was disappointed when i put it on though because it fits like a babydoll pregnancy top its snug around the bust and then flares out pretty widely through the lower half you cant really see that on the model i was hoping it was more of a fitted tee but sadly that wasnt the case
3,do not under estimate the boxy shape of this it looks kind of like a hospital scrub i think with this top the styling is key the sleeves are long and boxy and the neckline is somewhat of an oval so for me this wasnt a top i could just throw on without doing some outfit editingi styled this with a dark high waisted skinny jean which i tucked the shirt into and some red heels and i was ready to go anyways the material was great it was a silk type polyester that didnt seem to be static prone
3,otti is really sweet and has nice features that help our baby to fall asleep unfortunately the movement is stuck on the stomach very sad i would not have thought that such a product would break so quickly would like to complain but i find here no way
3,this show features a masterful mixture of stunning cinematography captivating cgi astounding acting mesmerizing music and a story that keeps you gripped the entire time oh and baby yoda what else could you want in a show
3,i have several pairs of coh and love them all when i saw these go on sale in my size i quickly purchased them however when i tried them on at home and looked in the mirror i was pretty shocked that the back pockets were extremely long meaning they go well below your butt cheeks like which means they look like they are sitting too low on your bodyand they arent they are actually i little higher waisted than most coh i thought perhaps it was my perception that day so i waited an
3,the mandalorian is on my list of favourite stories ever among the entire star wars catalogue i rank it as my favouritenever thought that possible about the jedi way of detachment this story is congruent with my own view of star wars that is its about friendship recall that selfish hans solo came back for his friend i get the importance of focus in training and the pitfall of distraction but to me love and friendship in addition to hope often play a role in any fiction or non fiction story where people face and endure adversity this theme is what rang true for me in this story too it has everything i lovea good story well told
3,i expected this movie to awake some sort of nostalgia in me but the truth is that it doesnt hold a candle to the classic addams family movies the addition of childish and annoying characters such as enid makes the series feel more like a kids show than anything else while jenna ortega does a decent job at playing wednesday the writing leaves a lot to be desired the first episode is alright and does a good job at capturing the feel of classic addams family movies but things quickly go downhill from there instead of being the creepy little girl that we all know wednesday comes across as this impudent teenager who pouts all the time and tries her best not to show any emotion while the original wednesday was dark mysterious and downright spooky this new one is just an antisocial adolescent who wears too much black
3,speaker quality is very bad display is also not satisfing
3,this recipe was okay the first time i made it except for the imitation crab meat and the lack of seasoning the second time i made it i made some changes i used real crab meat twice as much as the recipe calls for i also poached some fresh caught fish and deboned them and added the fish meat to the recipe i did not use scallops because i didnt have any i live on the water and have access to fresh fish shrimp and crabs so that is what i used i also added a little garlic and some cajun seasoning i doubled the sauce recipe and used a lot more cheese the second time i made it it turned out better i will give the original recipe a three star rating and the recipe after my few changes still just three stars and no i will not make it again it serms like something is missing i think its the ricotta cheese that my seafood lasagna recipe calls for
3,loved this dress and ordered it based on glowing reviews ordered size large because i weigh pounds and have a large g bust the dress skimmed nicely over my body but the baby doll style fit loosely and made me look really wide from the side i probably could have sized down for a better fit but it might have just emphasized my bust the fabric has a substantial weight and its lined best as a fall winter dress the embroidery is beautiful i disliked the intense black color around my f
3,battery backup is not good its only hours
3,it gets a little old to receive products over and over that do not match the photo or description of the product retailer the photo shows a black pant with blue colored striping the pants that i got are black with green and brown striping i find the color combination in the photo to be what i wanted and since the fit was nice albeit short and im only tall i would have kept these unfortunately the pants that i got are nowhere close to the description so i will be returning them the f
3,i was never a fan of the movies animated and live action but i definitely knew about the addams family this netflix show is extraordinary and has the potential to be a masterpiece if you know this magical feeling that movies like harry potter the lord of the rings the chronicle of narnia gave you when you watched them for the first time this is how wednesday feels like but in a weird way what weird way you might ask its hard to explain the environment the characters and the atmosphere is truly unique and magical but weird at the same time the characters especially wednesday are weird and that is the point of the addams family lore watch it i dont think you will regret it plus the adjustments that netflix did and the different types of characters that they amazingly blended together makes the show even better
3,i tried yellow motif but unfortunately i did not purchase it it was quite difficult to explain why it did not work for me i liked its floral pattern and shape of sleeves texture was ok usually i like a cool touch of linen but this tshirt was not as comfortable as the other products made of linen i was not quite sure it just was not right for me only word i could think was average personally i do not recommend it but who knows maybe it is right for you so try wear
3,henry cavills acting is on point but unfortunately he and the show are let down by the mediocre acting of the rest of the cast this really makes it look like a cheap movie at times other than that some scenes look rushed and for someone who might have no clue what this is about it might be difficult to piece it together shame the ingredients seemed to be there for something spectacular but the mediocre acting and rushed storyline degraded it
3,the scope is season one was huge season two seems to basically be a lot of talking and not a lot of action hard to follow and in the end not very satisfying hope season is better
3,this is so so soft and has a nice stretch to it the fit is great love the side zippers i wore it today for the first time and before i even arrived at the office i noticed a crazy amount of pilling where my purse rubbed nothing i cant get rid of till next time i carry a bag but if this keeps up there soon wont be much of a shirt left very disappointing for the price was lucky enough to snag this on sale but it was still pricey for the quality
3,i was disappointed in this vest it was stiff and scratchy and seems too big doesnt drape well fromm the armpit and bust line area not very figure flattering looks like i put a blue shopping bag on and belted it to try to add flair
3,i really wanted to love this tank top it has vibrant colors and a unique pattern however i should have listened to the reviews there was way too much fabric it made me look pregnant the tank top is going to be returned
3,i have been always a witcher fan long before the show was even in makingg i donot recall how many times i played the game or tried to read the book and boom netflix comes out with the most awarding show ever and with charming brilliant actor i fell in love with him as superman and then deeper as the witcherr the show has amazing production quality and the direction and acting skills oh how can i forget the music the only thing bothered me were triss marigold and yennefer playing the game you will come off with two awarding strong headed women who has a presence of their own but these two just did not connect to me wish had some better candidates netflix keep it up
3,which is it ounces of cheese or cups help please
3,i adored this suit the style the colors the thick quality of the fabricbut unfortunately the bottom seams cut into my groin and backside so much it was practically painful im lbs and usually wear a size small but was advised to size up even with the medium i tried on everything fit well but the length though ive never thought i had a long torso sizing up to a large would make the bust way to large for my small b chest was so sad to return this suit
3,i loved these pantsthey are so comfortable however after just wearing them twice the threads of the leaves are fraying and leaving lint on whatever i sit on the leaves at the seat of the pants are now slowly disappearing this after wearing twice to work i imagine after a few more wears that the leaves at the seat of the pants will be close to gone or at least much less white with threads then the rest of the places this is super unfortunate and will be returning too bad they were l
3,the outside of the product is soft but is otherwise very hard the price did not seem to match the overall quality of the product when compared to other products that are similar
3,from the start i thought i was watching a slytherin character at a spinoff hogwarts school but all in all the show goes well from start to finish with a nice witty character dialogue i found myself giggling at time to time listening to their conversations and wednesdays need for a negative view on everythingmy over all experience was met with satisfaction and im left wanting more season please it would be nice to have more off the family the addams gatherings i was not sure if i would enjoy this but i was wrong in the end the show holds up well the acting is strong on all parts the cinematography is top notch
3,just finished the first season i enjoyed it much more satisfying than the films where i could never get over tom cruise playing reacher i like that they kept the violence of the books ritchson looks as id always imagined reacher face wise although he is a little too ripped in the books reacher never goes to the gym hes just your natural brick shhouse but thats a minor point i can live with some of the acting and script is a little wooden sometimes especially ritchson but having said that his character isnt known for being loquacious hopefully in season two theyll get it tightened up
3,like the idea of this longer teetunic to wear with leggings but i found it not flowly enough in my regular retailer size small fit on top but not really on the bottom with the side slits unflattering how the slits hit me maybe for some one taller i am
3,about a month ago i purchased the pilcro hypen chinos in moss size petite i loved the color and fit so much that when i saw free shipping being offered i decided to get another pair this time i ordered the color pink and of course size petite well the color really isnt pink and unlike the moss color it does not look the color online the color is more like salmon or apricot definitely not pink what bothered me more is the fit this pair was too big its mindboggling why the sizing
3,this dress is so pretty in the photos but in person its huge and not in a way i could adjust by sizing down the shoulders and arms fit but the body of the dress is absolutely huge i normally love a trapeze dress but i was swimming in this so it was quite unflattering it was also much longer than it looks on the model im not short in fact dresses are normally a bit shorter on me than the average person but this was just frumpy
3,without seeing the online exclusive notation i went into my local retailer store to try on this sweater because sometimes i wear small and sometimes a medium once the very helpful retailer employee looked it up and advised they dont carry it in stores i ordered it at the checkout desk in a size medium i was so excited with anticipation because i love stripes and i love the color gray this sweater was right up my alley i was very disappointed when i decided to return it first of all i d
3,we have to go tommys got a plan an excellent crime drama
3,but this one does captivating and exciting it lived up to the images i had in my head well done
3,ordered these in p last year prob could have worn a p ordered p and p this year the past couple of years the pilcro stet jeans in white fit me because they were cut straighter and not as curvy this year neither size fit this year the cut changed and it has a curvier fit its the waist that doesnt work for me if youre curvier this is probably a good fit change
3,this shirt had everything going for it the cut the length the fun texture but when i stepped into the light it was totally see through i dont want to have to wear another shirt underneath this one is going back definitely not a swing but still cute
3,tried on the xxs petite and still felt that it looked too boxy and baggy on me cute concept but poor execution
3,this is such a great series and i am loving that everything about the reacher actor is exactly how i know him in the books right down to the black coffee toothbrush and his physique not skinny and short like some other actor tom this is very well made and if you understand the books you will be happy all i can hope for is that after this series they continue with another story from the books this must continue for all the books love it
3,its okay for a coverup or beach dress and lounging around the house its comfy and i like the detail of the back the front is very plain but okay its not too baggy and its a straight cut the detail in the back makes it a keeper for me but only as a casual dress too chill at home or quick errands to grocery store
3,the show is a very good adaptation of the book and is true to the spirit of the jack reacher series it suffers a bit from it since some problems are directly translated but it manages to tell the story well and expanding on a few elements alan ritchso is physically the perfect fit for reacher but lacks a bit of the inevitable feeling that the character broadcasts also his smirks are a bit much but im knitpicking here
3,i absolutely fell in love with the stress when i sought in the store the fabric and drape of the fabric is amazing however it runs extremely small i normally wear a medium and can sometimes even wear a small and dresses i tried on the medium and the large and i could not even get them zipped all the way im so disappointed as this is a gorgeous dress definitely size up at least one maybe two sizes
3,in budget this is the okay choice
3,ease of use is an obvious advantage and clothes come out smelling great however effectivity does not seem to be as good as the persil nonbio liquid that i normally use
3,lenovo laptop is to slow
3,havent decided if im going to keep this dress yet it arrived torn at the seams but was able to use two sided tape to fix and straps were sewn on twisted in my opinion it is not worth full price i would say it runs tts im between and and a and the size sp fit perfect however the petite size runs pretty long it says inches from shoulder but i need to wear it with inch heels mine may have been a wrong size marked issue dress looks exactly as in the picture
3,this shirt is enormous and as the title of my review suggests it looks like a mens button down the fabric is quite sheer but thats actually what i liked best about it i just looked completely shapeless in this top wish i had realized it before i wore it out because i would definitely have returned it perhaps if i had bought it sizes smaller i might have liked it better it didnt fit anything like the model photos suggest its huge not easyslouchy
3,this shirt is adorable love the lace detail on the sides but way too boxy for me its a great lighter weight for spring but it doesnt feel flimsy sadly there isnt any shape to help make this flattering it will be returned
3,i couldnt believe there werent more reviews complaining about the arm size then i found them yes this is a cute shirt if you have toothpicks for arms so true the shirt is adorable a bit guazy so not going to be super warm for fallwinter but i live in cali so thats not an issue but my arms arent even big and this shirt is so snug around my arms unfortunately its going back
3,battery to worst for new one
3,loved this shirt but it runs pretty big im normally a smmed due to bust size ddd and ordered a small based on other reviews could have gotten an xsmall debating going to exchange i ordered it in three colors bc it was on sale better quality than some at retailer
3,tried this on yesterday in the fitting room and i really wanted to get it but two problems not made for c cup bra women or larger and the ruffles come right out of the nipple line area of the chest so when you see yourself at a profile view theres these ruffles that look like theyre coming out of your chest just sayin not for me
3,dress runs small esp where the zipper area runs i ordered the sp which typically fits me and it was very tight the material on the top looks and feels very cheap that even just pulling on it will cause it to rip the fabric pretty disappointed as it was going to be my christmas dress this year needless to say it will be going back
3,low waisted weird liner
3,i made this recipe exactly as written and mine came out much drier i think it should have we were really disappointed in it the first night the second night i served with sour cream and enchilada sauce and it was much better but still not something that i would make it again if i did make it again i would make some changes one of which would be to incorporate the sour cream and the enchilada sauce into the layers i would liked to have given this ½ stars it was not awful so i did not want to give it stars just not that special it does make a lot
3,i just received this dress in the mail today i ordered an xs and it was huge there is no way that i could wear a bra without it showing due to the size of the arm holes im and lbs with an athletic build for reference i love free flowing dresses but this was over the top i ordered the plaid version in an xs petite and that fit much truer to size i reordered this in an xs petite to see if that will work better the dress itself is lovely the green color is vibrant and the embroid
3,first of all the fabrics summery pattern of blossoms honeybees and butterflies is beautiful and absolutely unique i love it so much i wish i could afford to keep the dress as an art object also with one important exception the dress is well made the underslip is the right length and opacity the dress is not transparent which is a big plus there is a slight greenish cast to the background instead of the pure ivory shown in the pictures this makes the color a bit harder to wear and
3,ms office is not available and antivirus not install
3,display is averagerest everything is good
3,alienation comes in all shapes in this marvelous and inequivalently hilarious miniseries barring the zenlike setting of a posh tropical resort the tensions run deep this series shows how different the classes see the same situations occurring even members of a family and their daughters guest cant get on the same page when it comes to relaxing and just laying back and enjoying life the staff of the hotel sees their guests through some shades of contempt but all must perform to follow guidelines on behavior and personal needs i was mostly unfamiliar with the cast with the exception of connie britton the entire cast rates a thumbs up for the portrayals of their characters the writing is first class bring the human foibles to a head music is spot on to suggest the serenity of the islands and the tensions of the characters the imagery of the rolling ocean and the waves crashing in and out is an allegory to the feelings of loneliness and desperation experienced by the guests and staff of the resort well worth the time to view and thankfully the miniseries has been renewed for another season as i understand it the series will be set in another location with a different plot
3,i am lbs normally a size l and ordered both a small in the navy and a medium in the beige the elastic waist on both is not a tight muffintop producing elastic like on some thinner banded leggings in fact the elastic is very loose not very stretchy on either of the sizes i think the s had been previously tried on given the state of the packaging and the fact that the seat of the pant was already a bit stretched out the m is definitely too large so i would say that these run
3,i ordered this dress in small my usual size for reference lb it is too wide it looks more fitted in the pictures and hangs loose on me the belt does not help much it still looks like a sack and i feel like a girl wearing her moms dress also i found that the material crumples easily
3,i ordered this skirt hoping i could wear it to work as it looked tailored on the model this skirt is made from a heavy material but flares out it is a whole lot of skirt im and short waisted it looked like i was getting swallowed up i love the colors and design but it just overwhelmed me it would work on someone taller
3,didnt care for the flour tortillas corn tortillas would have been better i think filling was just okay
3,battery drains very fast
3,a totalitarian authoritarian government would mandate that everyone get vaccinated and lock downed in their homes i dont see that happening in the usa
3,the color and fabric of this item are so appealing and i think this is a great piece for the right person the fabric is beautiful but also much thicker than id imagined from the photos it has a quilted quality so doesnt drape very well and is just too much fabric for me around the arms i typically wear a size and ordered the large i think a medium might have been better havent decided yet whether to exchange for m or just plain return has an artsy cool professor vibe that i like
3,product is good for student or small office purpose
3,i was very excited about receiving this dress unfortunately i was a little disappointed when i opened the package as the color was darker than on the picture i live in florida where the sun is always shining and although this dress has a beautiful simple design it isnt for me as the color is too winter
3,this suit is so adorable i love the retro style and the two patterns and i really wish it worked for me the suit is comfy seems well made and fit nicely but although it fit technically i dont like the way it cuts me off at the thigh its not flattering for me at all the suit is kind of a neoprene material so its thicker than a normal bathing suit so i think even though it isnt lined it might not be seethrough but i didnt get it wet to test it out in terms of fit i think it
3,it left mixed feelings sincerely without watching the first and the second seasons once more it can be difficult to say with certainty whether the third season was too weak or has the mandalorian simply lost its charm of novelty in it was a cultural phenomenon for sure all seemed fresh exciting and extremely promising but the pandemic the long interval between the second and the third season and the oversaturation of the cinema industry with the star wars content in recent months could have spelt their role and frankly speaking the unrivalled andor makes most of television nowadays appear rather bleak and this is by no means valid only for the star wars universe on the one hand there are many things in the third season which could be highly entertaining a machine rebellion clones mind washing old acquaintances old foes mythosaurs on the other hand too little was told and there are many threads which hang loose still they have some potential for the future after all mandalorian can be just a repose before a new breathtaking adventure an analysis of the nature of the new republic and of the causes which will eventually lead to its demise of the threats posed by the remnants of the galactic empire would be highly satisfying if executed properly to really impress fans the creators needed to do something very daring like say making bokatan a traitor or grogu a son of mof gideon it is not a spoiler to say that this didnt happen but the finale of this season although it is not especially catarthic provides for some dynamic and some naturally looking and heartwarming moments so it is always advisable to give your favorite shows a benefit of doubt one couldnt probably lose too much if one waits until the season four and if it is of unacceptable quality then it is safe to pronounce a destructive judgement you are a mandalorian no more
3,price wise worth not by performance wise this is not functioning as per configuration if it is i gen means that function like extra ordinary compare to my another i th gen i should rate that performance was good
3,mike whites the white lotus is more than just a satirical drama its a masterclass in tension social critique and character study all wrapped in the glossy packaging of a luxury resort the show brilliantly dissects privilege power dynamics and the hidden rot beneath the seemingly perfect lives every element is topshelfcinematography that frames paradise with an unsettling undercurrent a plot that simmers with slowburn dread and an ensemble cast that delivers razorsharp performances but what truly elevates the white lotus is its sound design and ost cristobal tapia de veers score is hypnotic primal and almost hallucinatory amplifying the shows unease in a way that lingers long after the credits roll few series can balance sharp satire with genuine psychological depth like this one the white lotus is intoxicating uncomfortable and impossible to look away from
3,the gb version does not seem as reliable as the lower gb versions i have had to reformat this card twice a real nuisance when its working it does well
3,being that i am short this skirt flares out way too much resembling a s style poodle skirt the model in photo has her arm strategically placed thus pushing back excess fabric toward the back making it look more streamline this skirt is not for the under long leggy types could easily rock this
3,this show is written like a comic book dialogue action scenes archetypes all of it the scenes all unfold as character told to go somewhere and complete task character goes to location and completed task with no challenges given new task to go to new location and so on and so forth theres not much of a variation to the scenes of the main character just being awesome and dominating all opponents with ease the characters are similarly all stories weve seen before you can easily predict the outcome of every interaction because the characters are all so predictable and played out once you kind of understand that and accept it for what it is its pretty entertaining dont take this show too seriously and youll enjoy it
3,my husband and i enjoyed this soup i made a few changes to make it smaller since there are just the two of us ground beef can beef broth in place of water and boullion oz diced tomatoes and cooked instant white rice we had in pantry otherwise i made as listed and it was great much thicker the second day and was great with cornbread muffins
3,i love the fabric of this dress and the way it fits but it is too low for me i thought about putting a cami under it but that would ruin the look of the dress just an inch or so higher would have been much better as much as i like the design and fit i will be returning this dress
3,the mechanism is a little noisy when breathing and if the tummy touches baby when the otter takes a breath the gentle pressure it creates turns the otter off but i love the sounds and the light their is a volume control which is great overall i like it just wish it wasnt as sensitive
3,im satisfied with its performance but the display quality is very bad
3,a great first episode i never knew what to expect from this series but finally got the opportunity to watch im binging up to episode now the characters and actors and quirkiness is great i want to make a special mention of how much i love their use of beautiful hawaiian music
3,i went into this one cold out of nostalgia for both the original addams family show and the movie episode however set my expectations this is not even adjacent to that one let alone a spin off sure some of the characters share the name and aesthetic but thats about it its a show for grade schoolers only packaged in a dark aesthetic think the new sabrina mixed in with riverdale jenna ortega as wednesday was amazing and the saving grace of this show she killed it every second she was on screen most of the humor worked because of her delivery the costume and set designs were also striking but then you have the actual plot and writing the character development is nada the world building is so simplified that its down right childish some of the lines were good but that was only because of jenna ortega delivery more often than not the show dipped into cheesy and cringe territory the cgi monster was something else overall this show is a it gets two extra stars for the acting alone but thats about it
3,i am and typically wear a size i am a rather busty kind of gal h so i usually order larges in tops so that i am sure there is no pull across my chest i ordered a large in this top in the plum color when i received the top i could not stop laughing at how huge it was the fit in the chest area is fine but i can wrap the sides around me and tie them into a bow at least half of the material needs to be removed despite how huge the top is it is very cute otherwise i just mail
3,i dont get the positive reviews nothing happens in these first episodes until the end i completely zoned out and nearly fell asleep while trying to watch this where is the empire they talk about where are the stormtroopers where are the spaceships instead we get these blade runnervibe wannabecops who can only be described as jar jar binkslevel clowns especially the chubby chernobyl coal miner who ran around with his exposed wiener who acts as unintentional comedy relief character i guess hope it picks up the pace because this is nothing not bad just nothing id rather watch obiwan again obiwan was bad but at least it was star wars
3,although moist i didnt find it very flavorful maybe i didnt measure right
3,i ordered this in both the white and navy colors navy being what looks like an ivory background with navy spots when i received the blouse the background on the navy is actually a light greybeige color that makes the whole top look kind of dingy when ordering the navy version be aware that the product images dont show the true background color on the top
3,dont usually write reviews but this rd season was so bad boring weak soap opera forcing narrative been there done that garbage the future is not bright for this show the only bright spot was the monsters and they were few and far between it started as if it was going to be a great season maybe one of the best scenes in the series but went stale instantly wayyyy to talky very little action the story was all over the place and the recaps were the only value you can probably watch the recaps and be done with it im not sure how episode made it to the screen and out of nowhere the narrative hits the bard cmon when will this nonsense end watch and youll probably feel like youve seen everything in this season before in multiple shows and movies very dissatisfying and disappointing
3,this card does exactly what it should class performance at a fair price in a microsd format it should be faster though and in fact there are options out there now at a nominally higher price that do including the extreme versions from the same vendor
3,my title perfectly describes my attitude toward this sweater the print is super cute and the price point is great but this sweater was so itchy that i couldnt even keep it on for longer than a minute it may be okay with a long sleeve underneath but dont even think about wearing it by itself
3,so this is a super soft comfy sweater the color is great and i really wanted to love it but the dolman sleeves sort of annoyed me that being said all of the good things about this sweater almost made me keep it the neckline is also really neat it drapes nicely and stays that way if you are on the fence give it a try
3,easy to make tastes ok id call it average
3,overall laptop is good performance is good i played some games runs very smoothly but the battery backup is very bad it only gives hour normal usage with battery saver hour
3,my family has been making this recipe for probably years but in the version i have all the ingredients for the sauce are halved water sugar cornstarch thats what is making this version of the recipe way too sweet
3,cute design runs big in neckline falls off shoulder exposing bra straps fabric is very thin sloppy look on short petite frame lbs cd purchased a medium havent washed it yet but the fabric doesnt look like it will hold up well i have kept it to wear as a sleep shirt with thin gray sleep sweats
3,after seeing this dress online and noticing how quickly it sold out i was curious about it but thought i was out of luck it just so happened that i ran into the store and they had one returned in my size i tried it and wasnt sold however i loved the color it was snug across the shoulders and arms the rest was somewhat flowy but boxy at the same time i ended up bringing it home to think on it after trying it on again i realized the snugness across the shoulder really caused the top t
3,i never give a ten unless it is blinding so a is excellent but not astounding the blinders really took me to the grit and dirt of post ww britain it is atmospheric and draws you into the time it was actually bit of an education of how people lived the plot is complex and mysterious and you find yourself trying to guess what will happen next there is a fantastic underlying romance cracking on there are a good few sub plots spinning about to keep you amused and entertained a few laughs and feel good moments a few tragedies to keep you depressed if thats what your into i started to relate to the characters quite early on and they are all distinctive you really feel involved from the start unless you have no social skills all in all a good watch i was waiting for it to come on the next week not literally obviously i didnt like sit in my flat for a week looking at a blank screen till it came on but i did look forward to seeing the next episode you certainly wont waste your time having a gander
3,probably should have returned this but its just so pretty i got complements from strangers the very first time i wore it but its extremely long tucking it in will be toughwhere do you put all that length aside from that it is beautiful the embroidery is soft and delicate light blues gold neutrals hard to see in the pic but there are textured polka dots all over the shirt great buyi just wonder how ill wear it or if the length will be too much and it will become a closet sitter
3,i ordered the geometric bluered pattern in a small regular the material was soft and comfortable it is a standout piece but unfortunately it made my stomach look like it was sticking out too much the neck line did not stay flat against my chest which resulted in an illfitting bunched up look i returned this one for reference im lbs a
3,the shirt is nice but not as nice a material as i was hoping but i kept it anyway but after washing it it is even more disappointing not very soft and now kind of an odd length hopefully it will grow on me but wouldnt recommend it especially for the price
3,i think this blouse would work for petites it is super short and boxy looked nothing like the fit on the model sad to return it love the print
3,i have to be honest and say that this series has so far been dry and slow as well as lacking in what we usually get in a star wars product i have given it a chance so far and while i cant stand michael baytype movies that have too much action with little story to tie it together this series seems to lack the action to balance everything that may be okay with a straight drama but it doesnt fit my expectations for star wars i expected also more exposition into the influence of the empire and their oppression that leads to the birth of the rebellion instead we see the interactions of different characters in whom are hard to take interest because its star wars i am generous with my rating but i hope to see better output as the series moves forward
3,i had a difficult time getting through the first episode of season yes this series is a little slow specially season but i promise you this if you stick with it it will grow on you so much so that it may end up becoming one of your favorite shows on tv there are many things that are impressive about this show the soundtrack mixing etc the camerawork the direction the locations and settings etc etc i can go on and on but what is truly impressive is how they have constructed their characters layer upon layer they keep revealing everything about them and what lies beneath everyone will relate because even if we dont act on everything that goes on in our crazy brains we do have at some point come across these crazy thoughts or so i think
3,the material is awesome and its a super pretty dress it just didnt work on my body
3,i thought this would be so clean looking in a theoryvince menswear way but unfortunately the cut of the coat is super unflattering i waiver between a and a at retailer and erred on the side of caution and went with the the shoulders are way off the mark sleeves are too long and the button hits about inches too low its justbaggyin a way that the size itself is not the issue alas this is going back and my search for the perfect coat continues
3,bluetooth not connect in any device
3,its great i love costner and i eagerly awaited the debut of this show and while a few episodes showed some promise the story builds to an exciting and dramatic conclusion to season some of the criticism on here is absurd stick with this show it is truly a keeper
3,i was excited to buy this sweater based on the online pictures although the ombre coloring is beautiful in person i did not like the metallic trim at waist cuffs the pictures dont really show the extreme brightness of the trim it looks literally like xmas ribbons were sewn into the sweater to me it looked like something a child would wear i ordered the which was the smallest size offered it is oversized without much shape and i felt it added bulk around the middle
3,overrated the inconstancy of the shot quality mixed with overacting cheap sets and cheese ball humour makes it hard to get fully absorbed
3,i have read all of the reacher books and for me casting alan ritchson as reacher is along the line of how i would expect reacher to look for those who say he is too much gym bunny for the role read the books reacher is a tall imposing muscular man so what if ritchson is well defined the series follows the book well there is no snowflake or leftist influence the violence is brutal and straightforward just as you would expect when reacher is wading in and breaking teeth and bones it is great
3,i received this yesterday and the fit for me is so strangeto tight in the bust and the arms were to big for mei am so bummedthe arms do not stay on my shoulders i have many tops but maeve and they fit me wellthis is the first one i have to return this top is made well and i do recommend but it should be tried on before purchasing as it is pricey if it does not fit you
3,this top has too much fabric i would of liked it more if they had a smaller size but the small seemed like a medium or large
3,display is the reason to consider this laptop major con heating issues certain part of touchpad is not functioning
3,first of all i love cashmere so by default i love this sweater shawl the photos are a bit odd because you can wear it two different ways if you wear it so its long in front then the back comes up a bit higher and vice versa my only big complaint is that ive worn it twice and theres already a large hole in the arm seam poor construction which is disappointing hopefully mine was a oneoff id recommend it but definitely wait for a sale
3,i had been eyeing this top for weeks its look so beautiful on the model however not great on me material is fab the tee is way shorter than it appears online and there is too much flutter material
3,display is badperformance is average cant say a fhd display
3,this is a great genre and done very well with great casting directing and amazing cinematography if you have been considering watching this dont wait any longer
3,i ordered this in an xs which is my normal size in retailer tops the stitching and detail on the straps is beautiful but they were also somewhat tight across my bust and across my back it puckered in a strange way that wasnt flattering back it goes unfortunately
3,it is a very pretty skirt but arrived extremely wrinkled and the waist is very fitted overall i probably would not have purchased it if i had actually seen it in the store
3,peaky blinders has come to a shocking conclusion with season gripping heartwrenching and unmissable the world created by steven knight just keeps getting better and better the first two episodes of the season were a bit slow to get going but they were necessary to set up the rest of the season we see tommy shelby cillian murphy at his lowest point struggling to cope with the death of his wife grace annabelle wallace and on the verge of a complete mental breakdown the rest of the season is full of twists and turns with old enemies returning and new ones emerging the shelbys are pushed to their limits as they try to protect their empire from those who want to destroy them the acting is as always outstanding cillian murphy gives one of the best performances of his career as tommy shelby a man who is fighting a losing battle against his own demons the rest of the cast are also excellent with special mention going to paul anderson arthur shelby and sam neill inspector chester campbell the direction and cinematography are beautiful and the music is perfect every single element comes together to create a show that is simply unmissable i cannot recommend peaky blinders enough it is one of the best tv shows i have ever seen and i cant wait to see what steven knight produces next
3,this sweater is much more cropped than shown the sweater i received was only inches long the color of the trim is black not the navy or plum that i expected quality does seem good
3,i wanted this top in a petite xs but it was sold out so i got the xs im with a b bust and while the bottom comes down to my waist like on the model the sleeves are a bit longthey seem a little long on the model too i wore this to work and constantly had to pull my top back as the scoop neck kept drooping down as i moved around throughout the day really like the tie neck feature though
3,the addams family sitcom from the s set a standard that no subsequent adaptation could even come close to two seasons with a total of episodes are one of my fondest childhood memories perfect casting perfect morbidcomic atmosphere brilliant dialogues and replicas and seductive carolyn jones an unforgettable experience partly because its so good and partly because i cant forget something that i rewatch every couple of years tim burton is one of my favorite filmmakers batman edward scissorhands batman returns charlie and the chocolate factory corpse bride sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet street are pretty strong reasons why i had high expectations for this show unfortunately it would have been better if i had approached the wednesday series without any if it was supposed to be a comedy its not funny if it was supposed to be a horror its not scary its not dramatic its not tense its not particularly imaginative the addams family was originally conceived as a satirical inversion of the ideal postwar middleclass american nuclear family eccentric morbid and seemingly completely oblivious to how others perceive them wednesday is conceived as a girl who is extremely different from the students of a normal school not an academy for fantasy beings the other addamses have no connection with their black and white ancestors neither in appearance nor in character the characters dont have the charm of the originals the series isnt nearly as funny as the old one and it doesnt have the iconic tune we all had our fingers snapping along to long story short for a fan of the sixties series and even compared to the films that followed in the nineties the only thing this series has in common with its predecessors is the title and partly the image of addamses on the other hand viewed independently of its predecessors wednesday has its qualities impressive photography and use of color interesting if very poorly developed characters and despite in my opinion a barely mediocre script excellent acting by the entire cast i was particularly won over by hunter doohan and emma myers and by far the strongest asset of this series and the only reason why i didnt give up on it after one or two episodes is jenna ortega whose wednesday completely overshadowed christina riccis its not the wednesday we loved in the sixties and nineties but this new one might be even better jenna made this character her own and i think i can say with certainty that from now on her performance will be the first thing most people associate with the mention of wednesday and even the addams family in general
3,battery backup to hr at normal use
3,its ok just recast triss the first episode is poorly directed but after that its decent the casting is pretty bad and triss ruins the show yennefer was suprisingly okish please recast triss
3,to those of you who believe what is happening in this show could really happen in the us need to stop its neither probable or possible so please stop trying to make the connection that being said this is a fantastic show well written and superbly executed by the cast by the end of the first episode i was ready to binge watch an entire season so do yourself a favor watch this show from an entertainment standpoint and not as a cautionary tale
3,have not played the game and do not plan to but the first episode feels like an instant classic a kubrickesque level of attention to details all the easter egg hunters are doing extra shifts convincing acting great camera perspectives and sounds if i had to choose between grogu and ellie i would chose ellie i already hope that there will be a second season in case you get lost in the darkness of these time this series can bring you some light and hope mando can leave his helmet on so joel can fix his watch a winwin situation if you ask me can t wait for episode enjoy the ride
3,battary back up not good
3,the straightleg silhouette is ruined for me by the immediate bulge beneath the elastic waistband mostly caused by the pockets their openings protrude out right below the waistband its not flattering and while the trousers are not too tight for my hips they give the impression of extra hips if not for that silhouette issue i would keep the trousers as they are comfortable and pretty and unlike my other trouser options not seethrough as i feared
3,everything is good except the tn panel it is too fade in colors when you compare with ips panel buy it if your use is just for productive purpose for entertainment purpose its not recommend
3,great taste and smell a bit too sweet for me so id cut the sugar down also was a runny mess will need to add a little more flour and coconut but plan to make again
3,value for money good performance but battery backup is only disadvantage and suitabke for outdoor good for coding
3,this is easily the best new television series ive seen in a very long time the writing directing cinematography and performances are all immaculate i had very little context having never played the games or knowing much about the story but postapocalyptic stories are my jam the stand has been my favorite novel forever i am legend early walking deadthese are stories that i am the target audience for i wanted to wait for all of the episodes to be available so that i could binge and i wasnt disappointed by this sure social media ruined several of the storylines for me months ago but that didnt stop me from being completely sucked in and enjoying this series to the fullest extent i dont hand out a lot of s on this app but this was the easiest rating to give to date looking forward to season two
3,i recommend this topper but with reservations it is beautiful looking especially the lace portion it is also very wide the gathered portion is a complete design fail it balloons up right below the bust making one look wide and pretty ridiculous its obvious that the model is hiding the gathered poof by placing her arms close to her body but i knew this from the other reviews posted here so it was no surprise i ordered size s the smallest available and it fit very wide more like a
3,as societies evolve many practices ideas and beliefs diminish or vanish here we have an advanced society being replaced by a primitive society yes a dystopian society but a society using the stupid beliefs which we should be ridding ourselves of and using them to enforce new practices for living im very excited to see where this show goes who is behind it how did they manage to get so many men to think backwards brainwashing electroconvulsive treatment these are english speaking intelligent men with very stupid beliefs running this community
3,buy in range of or go for an i or i laptop
3,we really enjoyed this make sure your pork chops have a little fat on them
3,the otter itself is cute and also cuddly unfortunately i have to say that i feel the engine as quite loud which does not contribute to falling asleep the music goes like this unfortunately they are not played very long and changes quickly also the noises i find sometimes rather disturbing rather than reassuring with us he unfortunately did not help
3,battery is way below the expectations doesnt hold even for min after full charge
3,theres barely anything connecting this to the addams just the name characters outside of wednesday are boring and on top of that its just a bunch of teenage supernatural drama cliches and tropes weve seen already for over years now this feels like it was another show and netflix decided to attach an ip to it to make it sell better pretty common nowadays but disappointed that this is from burton most of his other fish out of water movies work so much better since there is more to the characters i dont know maybe im the wrong demographic for this or im looking at it the wrong way
3,i saw the shirt at my local retailer store and loved the color and print however the shirt had way too much fabric i was swimming in it it was not flattering whatsoever plus its overpriced for a shirt im sadly returning it
3,really wanted to love dress but something was off with fit fabric is lovely and zipper detail nice unfortunately style was not for me
3,full disclosure i only watched about six or so episodes of the handmaids tale that doesnt qualify me to comment on the entire show which is going into season seven but i dont have a six episode option for commenting and reviewing id heard of the handmaids tale from someone who was raving about it so i decided to watch like many shows it was very engaging and intriguing to start its a dystopian show that mainly follows june osborne elisabeth moss she becomes a handmaid in a future which is extremely patriarchal though not really explained some fanatical men wrested control of the u s government to put in new repressive laws that essentially stripped all women of any rights some women like june became handmaids which were only one step above slaves and other women such as serena joy waterford yvonne strahovski who was married to one of the new world bigwigs had a position as a wife it was a miserable new world that you wondered how june and other handmaids would navigate it and more importantly how they would dismantle it i didnt stop watching for any other reason than there are so many programs on right now and i dropped hulu as a strategic budgetary move there are only so many streaming services im willing to pay for and hulu didnt make the cut
3,i really liked this dress in so many ways im tall and pearshaped so the flowy shape is great for me however the dealbreaker was how the armholes were cut it isnt that obvious in the photos but they are cut in around the bust in the front in a way that was really weird looking on me and it was too expensive to keep something thats unflattering too bad if they had just had a normal armhole it would have been a home run lovely fabric and nice that it has pockets
3,husband said this was sharp to begin with but quite nice as he got used to it i assume that this scent will grow on him the more he uses this thank you ocado for this sample
3,nice product but camera issue i had to fix it myself even customer care tried to solve it but couldnt else everything is fine
3,this dress runs a bit small the large arm holes were unflattering to my small chest also this dress seemed to make my belly protrude it kind of made me look pregnant in a way that no other dress has i could see this dress being flattering on someone with a very flat stomach or a large chest not me
3,you feel they borrowed a lot from harry potter and scoobydoo it is quite obvious who the villain is from the moment her backstory is presented and its easy to identify her from her episodic presence and lack of negative attributes so just like in scoobydoo the relations between characters is superficial and any negative attitudes just get lost in plot however for very young audiences you can see how these things are actually intriguing and wednesdays semidark background is edgy and cool also the way it directed the nature shots the creepy locations is all eyecandy i would have loved to see a bit more thrillerhorror as they barely show any blood and ridiculous wounds while every single action is cut before you can see it happening i guess they really wanted to be a family friendly show
3,this is a beautiful shirt however the cut and drape were off im only pounds but this top made me look pregnant the fabric jutted out at the front its a shame because it really is lovely i sent it back
3,beautiful victorian look blouse runs large and overly blousy on me
3,good coleslaw but nothing fantastic a lot of cholesterol and fat in one serving i prefer my old recipe with apple cider vinegar instead easy to make if time is tight i substituted freshly cut cabbage and carrot instead of slaw mix
3,bad battery and sound other than that all ok
3,i wanted to love this dress but the sizing was too large for me overwhelming my frame i am very petite for reference waist and usually get an xxsp or p but even the p was too large in both the waist and especially in the shoulder area at minimum for fit i would have had to have the dress taken up but required too much alteration the skirt is not lined which i found disappointing given the price the colors and handkerchief like hem is really cute though but i returned
3,i saw that this was one of the best rated casseroles so it inspired me to try it it wasnt anything to really rave about and i wouldnt make it again unless i added something like sausage maybe that would be better it tasted kind of bland to me needed some spices to taste like pizza
3,laptop is ok but atleast mention its was hz display
3,i bought this product for attending online classes teams does not work properly when class is going on it abruptly hangs cannot do anything need to force shut down this is happening daily even this happened with google classroom few times
3,i purchased this card on a daily lighting deal for my new samsung galaxy note ii it was recognized without issues i connected it with its adapter to my computers card reader to transfer about gb of data and the best consistent transfer rate average was roughly mbps thats less than of the advertised transfer rateto be fair ive used the same external card reader with my sony hx digital camera with an sd card gb class and i get double the transfer rate of what ive gotten for this cardhere is the setup sd adapter included with this card external in usb card reader connected to a usb port on my pc files transferred were of varying sizes transferred from tb seagate x sata hdd connected to sata port windows enterprise x oh yah babythe only excuse i give this card for its bad performance is the files were relatively small sizes but some of them were as large as mb this still does not justify the very low transfer ratei am not really picky because this card will reside inside my super phone but still it does not justify the money paid for this cardi hope this will help others
3,yes i bought this dress in anticipation of wearing it right away its not mean for everybody it would look good on a stick figure if you have some hips they balloon out
3,i ordered this in hopes of wearing as a tunic with leggings for my rehearsal dinner it is much shorter than expected and wouldnt have looked right with leggings it also was more gray than ivory and in the short time i had it on was shedding lint like crazy beautiful in photos but didnt work for me
3,i have never taken the time to write a review but i was so disappointed by this dress the design is cute and i got the medium instead of a small im normally a and i wanted to make sure it was a bit looser and below the knee that was a good call because the fit is comfy and cute belted however it is so very thin and see through i was looking forward to a cool cotton dress for summer but this will definitely require a full slip if i decide to keep it it came with no slip at all so th
3,this dress is most definitely not a maxi barely goes below the knees also you do not get the cute detail shown on bodice there are no folds which were an added plus on picture waist is higher not at natural waist very pretty silk though and still cute just not as pictured
3,these are great for summer except you need to size down unless the pair i received was an anomaly these run very large
3,overall performance is good with the rtx dlss support butit feels lagging while it is not plugged in it is lagging on even normal use like surfing or office task when it is not plugged in dont know windowsos bug or something and battery life is not good
3,cute sweet but expensive for what it is
3,it good
3,this skirt is very pretty but i think it runs very large i am a size xs in retailer my waist is inches pounds the skirt is touching the floor even if i wear high heels i will have to wear it up my waist the elastic band is weak not sure if it will hold the skirt it should be ok with a belt i still recommend it cause its so pretty
3,i resived this in after its not warking no user manual and warenty documents in box touch pad is not working properly
3,i find the series peaky blinders sensational because i am a fan of the climate of dirty history of europe and great britain this series provides it
3,one of the best movies serials with the best script best direction and perfect actors who united with the characters like the hit series sopranos the script is very good and does not water down during the series the studios where it was filmed the costumes the characters and the whole atmosphere send you directly to that era everything is painstakingly recreated in detail cillian murphy is extraordinary the timbre of his voice of the character is perfect continuation of the series starting in is welcome the screenwriter stephen knight the directors have created an exceptional film in which it is not only about villains and wrongdoers you can discover honor courage love family values justice and interpersonal relationships at every step in this series
3,performance not much delivered when we were using multiple tabs ram almost took consuming for multi taskingwe cant expect more from this laptop average
3,i consider this series until now im at the end of the third season the best series of all time the photography is wonderful the script is practically untouchable the performances are perfect ignore the negative reviews these people dont know what theyre talking about
3,i ordered the yellow color way expecting it to be a mustard color it seemed to have a greenish tint to it and didnt look right on me also the pockets didnt lay right so the flower didnt look right
3,this top is really cute but shorter in length than expected plus it shrunk considerably
3,this product sucks my phone keeps giving me a card removed please reinsert or something like that only to find out that they do have that problem gb sds and higher micro sd card ultra class complained to company and its taking forever for them to ship me a new one many mistakes happened with my new items and inconvenient better to have just returned it with amazon got the money back and bought a different one company sucks you would think sandisk is a reputable name but i bought cards from them g and g and both have problems
3,the fit on these is good for my hourglass shape and the fabric quality and comfort is good tooi think the rinse is just not as nice in person the orange stitching is pretty bright too i bought a pair from br a couple months ago that are almost identical in quality fit and color that i got for less than half the price of these i am going to return these and see if they have something better but will only buy in store from now on
3,i purchased these pants in blue they fit great only problem is that one leg is about inch longer than the other i got them on sale with a discount so i will keep them and take them to a tailor to fix bummer
3,gorgeous in every way except its length and how it hangs at the bottom i prefer a shirt i can wear tucked in or out this one will work well tucked in but not out so i am returning disappointed it was so well done in other particulars
3,i got an xs in this suit i am a this was much much too small it was very tight around the chest and i am only a a it is however a good looking suit i suggest sizing up
3,as with the title dont expect character development on this series except for one in season instead the characters spiral downward deep into their flaws i dont know what the exact word is but degeneration comes to mind needless to say this series is excellent in its delivery the creator wants to show us the cringeworthy behavior of the elite and how they leave chaos wherever they go it succeeds in that while treating viewers with beautiful sceneries thrilling mysteries and masterfully crafted scenes and stories personally though the aspect i enjoyed the most out of this show is its cinematography more than its acting and storyline which it receives welldeserved praises for i found the shots very enticing at the end of each season there will be an itch to travel to these locations and stay at these hotels but they are not for us plebs unfortunately usd per night
3,i didnt read the books nor played any of the games i knew nothing about it before watching this series and i constantly felt that the writers seem to be expecting audiences to be familiarized with the universe of the witcher apart from that the dialogue is atrocious at times so unrealistic it falls into the absurd the plot is jumping all over the place and not in a good way which turns out to be somewhat confusing at times combine that with mediocre directing and editing and you got yourself a barely watchable show its still entertaining and the action scenes are ok the premise is engaging and had potential it just feels like it ended up on the wrong hands this is aimed at the fans of the books and the games
3,i am totally on the fence with this shirt like the other reviewers i sized up because my normal was too tight in the chest a common problem for me the arms are strangely tight and i didnt get much more room in the bust with the but then the bottom of the shirt tents away and hangs funny this is obviously meant for those with a very small bust who are on the slender side i love the pattern and material though so im going to visit my trusty seamstress and see if she can place dart
3,to sum it up good acting vfx writing fight scenes bad slow or a bit boring at times i was pleasantly surprised the writers and acting made me like andor as a character because i thought he was not interesing in the rogue one movie of course diego luna is amazing he just needed more screen time and good writing since a very long time i was able to actually fear the empire without the need of the force i was able to connect with the characters their struggle uncertainty despair but also resilience and hope i cant say something like this is star wars because i dont believe it was which its not necessarily bad andor was something new different serious mature in the sense of both target audience and storytelling really good job everyone
3,its s everything what i wanted from a witcher serie
3,very good starting point for the series follows a few book story lines as an introduction to several main characters and plot lines looking forward to upcoming seasons
3,in a galaxy far far awaya bunch of british people relocated whats the deal with these new tv series having mostly british actors its kind of annoying yeah the main guy and the hot lead are mexican and the slimey buttkisser is american but the other are british whats up with that the funny thing is how the producers want to show diversity or try and eliminate racialethnic barriers by just mixing up everyone like the mistreated tribe that initially looks like a bunch of irish folk with orange hair then later has members that are black and asian i get the agenda of the producers but honestly it looks stupid shouldnt a tribe of people have the same physical traits and i just want to give a big ol kudos to the empire yeah you may be authoritarian and overhanded and evilbut you get an a for diversity black people in positions of power some asian people indians in charge and a woman moving up the latter the may be evil but they sure institute some quality affirmative action much more than the supposed rebellion of rich white snobs overall it was an ok series but compared to the other horrible star wars stories recently put out its very good in comparison but on its own meh personally i thought mandalorian was really boring i pretty much hate every star wars movie put out since the original actually the han solo movie also was ok using the same sets and same scenes essentially star wars has become boring the plots are predictable the stories are weak it feels like some writer for a sitcom was hired to write them im also wondering if i liked this better because of adria arjona whens the last time star wars had a gorgeous star like her overall not dying to see another episode it was just better than the other garbage disney studios has cranked out
3,this sweater is ok i love love love bell sleeves so i thought for sure this would be perfect i thought it would be a great sweater to transition from winter to spring but once it arrived i knew i had to return the sleeves are not only bell but very long and the sweater fits chunky on your midsection i like my sweaters more flowy if you like fittedstyle sweaters that are a bit roomy you would like this once also its a bit itchy for mebut im rather sensitive and if id loved this on
3,i was a little disappointed since it came without a box so where do i leave the adapter while the card is in the camera
3,really wanted to like this top the model has it on backwards the v is actually the back and closes with an eye hook that is where the tag is theres also a seam running down the back the front is actually a high round neck the material has a metallic thread and felt rather scratchy cheap im usually a s or xs in this top the s had too much material at the bottom and flared out strangely the xs was too short in the front and moving your arms caused it to ride up
3,its nice laptop but sometimes its stop working i called service centre the problem is still not solved
3,i was so excited to try this dress but after ready the reviewsi though they were all over the place i descided to order my typical retailer size small im lbs and wear a size well it was a snug fit i have a slim build and this was just to snug for my taste i imagine a medium would have been better however i was very surprised by the length and slit the dress hit at my knee cap with the slit going all the way up to mid thigh ive seen pics of this dress on instagr
3,good for students
3,what i mean is that everything that happens is triggered by some sort of accident or stumbling into a hint which leads to some other development wednesday is virtually clueless all the time and just does things at random really watch it again nothing is achieved by anyone at any point that isnt coincidental luck this puts a hefty damper on anything youd want from a thriller so as far as murder mystery goes this is basically about as good as a crappy scooby doo episode what redeems the show fantastic costume design great shots all around and fitting set pieces just really good production here then of course as anyone would tell you jenna ortega was outstanding as wednesday sadly only emma myers managed to come close in terms of performative prowess as her roommate enid all the other young actors are obviously talented but still overact at times of course this could also just be bad direction overall the writing was contrived and just full of ex machina convenient plot points so nothing felt like it tied the story together this happened then that happened then this happened all the time it was sometimes a bit funny mostly it was just bland and uninspired though the writers maybe just each started one thing and then finished another to explain this incohesive mess of a plot never mind the idiotic amount of stupid love triangles
3,i actually love this dress the colors on the dark gray are mesmerizing the design of the placket adds a special touch to the look my issue is the way it looks on my bodynot flattering i already have a squarish apple squarple body and the cut emphasizes this more i was hoping the fabric would hang on me the same way the ivory dress on the curly haired model does so i sized up all this did was make me look wider especially at the shoulders the drawstring at the elastic makes
3,i wanted to love this dress so much but unfortunately it ran way too big for my taste i am usually a in retailer and the small was huge on me the bottom half of the dress is very much a swing dress and is very wide much wider than it looks in the pictures i suppose that sizing down maybe even to a petite and having the dress altered to be narrower on the bottom half wouldve made it look like the picture but thats a lot of extra work for a dress that is already pretty pricey
3,yellowstone is an incredible journey like those you dont see anymore this show that started out in is still one of the best if not the best tv series even as is coming to an end but the heart and soul of this show are its characters that feel as real as it can get they make mistakes they have their priorities they teach us things good and bad but above all its the interaction between those characters and the lessons they learn and give to one another that really defeat anything else currently on tv john dutton a man that only wishes to live his final days doing what he does best has to be the main force stopping corporate or just vengeful interests from destroying his family and legacy kevin costner shows why hes one of the best actors of his and even the current generation beth dutton is an amazing character shes the true example of what a strong female character looks like shes both the sigourney weaver and the sarah connor of yellowstone shes strong but vulnerable shes smart but makes several mistakes in her personal life she can take on anyone but she needs those she loves rip wheeler is in some ways the son john dutton wanted but no less loyal and caring than a real son hell do what it takes to defend what is his world and those he loves hell not only fight fire with fire but hell bring napalm just to make sure once the enemies are down they dont get back up hes not heartless far from it in many ways hes the wisest seeing what others cannot see or refuse to see kayce is perhaps the weakest link from beginning until now he has still not figured out who he is and where he stands hes a good man in a world becoming darker and crueler his intentions are always the best but he keeps getting pushed into situations that shouldve already eliminated all his doubts and together in a similar line is monica dutton kayce wife she at least has learned from her lessons and set aside her doubts shes the rock that keeps kayce from falling apart and where beth is fire monica is water jamie at this point shouldnt be part of the show at all if not for what he has done at least because he knows nothing of loyalty or family and hes always being used even by those he thinks hes using join to memorable characters amazing filming utilizing to their max the landscapes of montana and theres almost nothing in this show that fails in terms of quality yellowstone is one of those shows that will be remembered for generations to come
3,super cute top thin would look great layered not crazy how it looked by itself
3,did not live up to my expectations of action they could have done much better
3,not bad value for money
3,cloth and stone has been getting a little shotty lately in terms of quality they used to be a pretty consistently highquality brand but lately ive been left a little bummed i got this in yellow which is really a muddy orangey color i think i would have gotten over the less desirable color if the fabric were better but it is actually two very thin layers of fabric that are stacked and snag easily sort of like a soft cheesecloth the shirt is definitely comfortable and cute but the qua
3,has i read the reviews would have realized the tshirt looking sleeves in the pic are attached to the sweater based on the pic and site description i didnt realize they were attached i thought it was part of the styling of the undershirt i think this very much limits the versatility of the sweater i ordered the white which is a beautiful color and very soft i am returning it cause i do not like the tshirt sleeve would rather have the flexibility to layer whatever shirt i wanted
3,i have never done a review before but this series is so good ive felt the need wednesday is witty clever and resourceful im in awe of how this series has been funny yet inspiring for many young girls and i hope it inspires girls to be more independent and trust themselves i have literally loved every single minute of this series and im about to watch it again already the music and instrumental incorporation is the icing on the cake i cant praise this enough i wont give any spoilers away but the cello solo towards of the end of the first episode absolutely mesmerised me please give the green light for the second season as im dying for more
3,the product is good but the backlit keyboard is not available in ideapad slim kind of cheating by flipkart they have given mixed reviews of ideapad slim in this product
3,while this top is pretty its very unflattering it just looks so boxy on me that it makes me look heavier too bad because i really wanted to like it
3,these werent what i expected but i kind of really like them they have a very high rise and so they end up being high waisted the fabric is stretchy so they are extremely comfortable however the fabric is very stretchy and im not sure i can wear them to work but theyre a little fancy for the weekend the color is more of a washed out coal than pure black all things i can work with but they are a little different than i imagined they are quite long im and will likely have to
3,loved loved loved seasons and best thing ive ever seen on hbo season though its getting boring nothing happens people says its a bit harder to get into but im at episode and still bored the director seems to be trying all the tricks from episodes but its not working anymore music is not as good the script is bad nothing happens no surprises the cgi monkeys are really bad i dont understand why they couldnt use real footage of monkeys as theres no special tricks or anything theyre doing really disappointing the manager in s is supposed to be weird but its just awkward and is not convincing theres too much repetition its getting to be tedious and i hope theres at least a bit of a surprise womewhere in the next episodes
3,just ok
3,finally a pretty maeve shirt that actually fit my apparently giant hulk arms but its so flowyswingy i had to return it this might just be a problem with being a larger lady but the excess fabric made me feel like i was wearing a tent and made me look x bigger than i was around my waisthips even when balanced out with leggings i thought about trying to size down but wasnt sure if that would even solve the excess fabric problem and still leave room in the arms of course i cant try
3,stretch out fast lb i order size which is my usually size they fit prefect for about hr and then stretched out feeling not right on my body maybe i should have gone down a sizes even so i feel like the and quality dont add up but they are very soft and comfortable i wouldnt buy them again
3,thought i would try this as other reviewers loved it and its out of my comfort zone it looked like a poncho with a baggy tank underneath not worth the price the tassels looked a bit worn as well
3,this shirt is beautiful however i thought that it was made of a softer lighter material it is instead made of a thick heavy material that was unflattering for my shape short torso anns large bust it made me look boxy and chunky in the middle sadly ill be returning
3,ive been eyeing this top up in the floral pattern for a while and finally ordered it when i had off i really dont think its worth the price and its not very flattering i think it would look better on someone less busty it seemed to accent my bust its definitely not my favorite piece and unfortunately i will be returning
3,everything is impeccable here faithful costumes good art directing beautiful cinematography great narrative and its characters and mainly jenna ortegas delightful performance as the charactertitle her acting is impressive and i think shes one the most talented actors today but the fact they made a horrible cgi of the creatures disconnect me a couple of times when i was watching i dont know if that was the idea if they wanted to do some trash movie vibe or something but if it had a stranger things level cgi this thing would be perfect netflix should definitely renew to season and invest way more in the visual effects
3,very good item
3,im and lb i have been wearing small a but this was realllllly small especially at my arms it made me look like i was taking off much more beautiful on the model a medium would e been too big on my torso the color is amazing made my blonde hair really pop i dont love green but this was so different would love to find something else in this color that suits me you need to be a super skinny waif to look good in this
3,sound quality poorest of all the laptops i have it took hours to set up windows pura online needed without internet it is impossible to boot in
3,its rare to see such a show being made these days faithful to the source material and stays away from propaganda alan ritchson as jack reacher couldnt have been a more perfect casting choice season support cast complements alan well and have their own character arcs which are also well written malcolm goodwin as oscar finaly and willa fitzgerald as roscoe conklin who by the way is one of the most well done strong female characters in recent memory season support cast is also great maria sten as neagley shaun sipos as o donnell and other army compatriots of reacher and there team dynamic is enticing to watch shows not perfect though it does not have that interesting bad guys however the mystery around each season is entertaining enough that it more than makes up for the above problem plus the action is spectacular this is how to do a faithful adaptation
3,this dress is sort of a mixedmedia dress the top colored portion is a slinky knit that dolan uses all the time i like it a lot the bottom is a tight silky twilllike weave the silhouette is straight which is what attracted me to it but when i put it on i realized that the waist wasnt going to work for me the split came at a point too high for me to belt and the sleeves made my wide shoulders look dowdy i am not a person that wants to put on a dress and have to style the heck out of i
3,i looked like i was going to work on a farm well made but seemed fit big i like and have owned wide leg pantscapris these were cartoonishly wide needless to say they were returned
3,it does what it says it will do unlike most people i knowit also handles very cold temperatures well too
3,this was a good recipe because my family liked it i guess i didnt care for it too much because it was so thick it almost has too much cheese in it is there such a thing so i would suggest maybe making it with extra beef broth or bouillon cubes and water and topping it with cheese for my personal tastes anyway
3,except battery everything looks grt
3,this is a beautiful and wellmade top sadly it just didnt work for me im with a pretty short waist and even on me it was too short the shortness mightve worked if it wasnt as baggy as it was i dont mind baggy loosefitting tops but this was so much so that it was just unflattering it looked a bit boxy as well
3,top is very wide and flowy i am petite with large chest so it hung from widest point and was not flattering would be very cute with the right body shape
3,it was ok does the job it was intended for
3,first time in a long time that a series had me reaching for the remote over a book
3,i bought this dress to wear to my lowkey backyard rehearsal dinner the dress its self is beautiful good quality and a perfect summer maxi however it was way too big im lbs i typically wear an xs and felt like i was swimming in fabric i loved the style and make of the dress so i choose to get it tailored
3,i am a dd in tops and in bottoms i tried both the navyred pattern and the green polka dot color and patterns on both are gorgeous the fabric is very comfortable and a nice fit on the bottom half size large fit perfectly in the waist however i had gapping across the bust size xlarge fit ok in the front of the bust but was loose in the back gapping at the neck and the waist was very loose cute and comfy but only recommended for smaller busted gals
3,i love a good peplum top and was so excited when it arrived but was sad to find the flare on the peplum was a little too much im not sure why it was so unflattering because in every other way it fit like a dream but it seemed like either there was too much or too little fabric around the waist to have it hang properly it had to go back
3,this just did not sit well on me while the length was fine and the fabric was a nice thick weave with a flattering amount of stretch the twist at the shoulder just looked odd it did not sit flat at all so it just looked like i had gotten dressed in the dark and had not managed to sort out my sleeves given the spoton quality i would definitely look into other items from this brand but back this dress went
3,this shirt is thin and probably not worth full price but it was flattering to my figure covered my post baby tummy and complimentedminimized my g size chest but the cut was off the seams for the arms were almost in the front at the chest so when i moved my arms i had limited movement forward and it pushed the embroidered panel out and was just irritating an entire day of readjusting my shirt would drive me crazy i tried the m and the l
3,seems to work good in my gopro have only had it a few days and if i have problems with it in coming months i will update this for not it works
3,was really excited to get this but got it on and i was swimming in it im not a tiny girl thicker athletic build and the large was massive sadly had to return dont know if ill try a size down
3,there comes a point where i have to draw the line with things i purchase i ordered this as i didnt have a black skirt but thought ti wasnt special enough dont get me wrong it fits nicely and is comfortable but i was wowed p or xs p fir perfectly in waist and lbs if you want ta nice casual skirt the sale price is a good fir for the skirt just wasnt enough for me
3,i loved the look of this top when i saw it online however when i received it i was kinda disappointed the color of the top was different than what i perceived initially its way more off white not my favorite the texturepattern of fabric on the body of the top was too near hanky for me the sequin detail at neckline is wonderful but not enough for me to keep unfortunately i will be returning this one not a hit for my desired as the tic but some one else might love
3,this bread was so delicious and moist i think i used chopped pecans in my first batch and we didnt really like them next time i may try another nut or just leave them off entirely i also added some nutmeg and cloves to bring out some of the flavor and next time i may add more pumpkin spice nutmet and cloves next time to see if it helps bring out the flavor other than that this was a great recipe that i will be making again in the fall
3,i really wish i could keep this top the material is okay and i have noticed with this brand shirts made from this material do not wash well or look that nice after a wash if you have the time to dry clean then i would recommend this top another tip if you buy this since i didnt read the description the top has buttons all down the front i am not a fan of button tops because i have a larger chest so i wouldnt recommend this top to someone who is busty
3,i loved this vest from the moment i saw it sadly though it runs way too large i first ordered it in a small and then an xs when it popped back even the xs was too large around my shoulders and waist the color was also a bit more beige than in the photos which was ok but i had to return it because of the size
3,this show just gets worse the more you watch it what on earth have they done here the writing is absolutely dreadful the script is full of cute little cliches and attempts to create poignant dialogue between characters interactions between characters seem disingenuous making it difficult to actually care about any of them the attempts to undermine almost every male character in the series for the sake of girl power is very obvious every single one of these scenes feels forced and adds nothing useful to the storyline as a female myself sitting through these scenes makes me cringe in the same way the walk of shame does after a heavy night out the storyline is dreadful and at certain points makes no sense the way geralt character has been written is awful and is not at all true to character as written within the original material the special effects are average at best there is so much poorly executed green screen if it were not for the semidecent action scenes and henry cavill this series would be unwatchable at this point cavill is outstanding and does amazingly with the garbage script hes been given i dont know what the writers and producers were thinking with this one but its abysmalgo home youre drunk
3,ive had this card for about a year and ive been very careful with it and it just broke when i popped it out of sd card slot on my phone but it was very reliable card when it wasnt broken
3,overall look is good battery is so so display vibrant processor smooth ssd works great the only problem is not preinstalled ms office extra headache for this i bought this for almost a deal breaker for me hope to be updated further as time goes by
3,i was really looking forward to getting this dress in the orange print but when i finally received i was a little disappointed the print placement is not the same as shown on the model so it doesnt look as a vibrant and colorful my version of the dress has more of that muddy dark print and hardly any orange or turquoise also the backside of the print is white and the dress is not lined i do like the way it drapes on my body and the overall styling the dress fits nicely in size medium on
3,the print is unique and fun however the longer length and heavier weight of the fabric was not the piece i needed in my closet
3,i ordered this sweater in black and thought it was a pretty design and something different in a cardigan when i tried it on it was an odd fit and very boxy and unflattering i wanted to like it and keep it but i knew i would not wear it so unfortunately it went back
3,battery backup is not given as mentioned in the features
3,performance is nice at this price only issue is with the display but the display is better than what the other famous vendors like dell hp or lenovo are providing and is also quite bright it is also light weight for a inch laptop the build is very much sturdy and design looks stylish drawbacks no backlit keyboard no fingerprint scanner no sd card slot only usb typea slots no ram upgrade options highlights lpddr ram mhz processor is great and is also power efficient read more
3,first i absolutely love this dress and i was super excited when it arrived today i sized up as other reviewers recommended and the dress fits perfectly however when i zipped the dress up the zipper came apart in the center going up another size would make the dress fit improperly so i am hoping to exchange it for a new one and have better luck with the zipper
3,absolutely love this blouse but if your a woman cursed with larger arms for your body size than this is not for you i couldnt get the lace part of the upper arms past my elbows oh well its going back
3,what a fun mysterious series this was i guess if you get bombarded from each side claiming a series is good there might be a chance it is indeed good there were some minor flaws but i extremely enjoyed the series so i will give it at least for now the mystery kept us engaged up to the last episode and kept us guessing my fear was that they would spread the plot into more series and have us wait rest assured that the plot of the series does come to a conclusion within the span of the episode with just a hint of more to come the locations characters camera work color palate are all well done this series is simply a joy to look at plenty of throwbacks to the earlier movies and the show doesnt take itself way too seriously entertainment how it should be
3,i fell in love with these online i thought they would be such a nice piece of statement denim unfortunately they did not work for me i am and the waist of these paints was four inches away from my breasts it didnt look bad from the back but from the front it was comical the denim itself is nice and heavy but like the previous reviewer stated not a dark wash the pair i received was a medium whiskered wash if i was taller these would have been a yes despite the wash discrepancy
3,could have been better and could have been worse nothing ground shattering here crime tough guy cover ups all been done before and will be done again started with a promise of something more but each episode seems to lower the expectations and become more stereotypical for the genre watch it for the big guy and move on
3,this product works as described its just not super quick i would recommend this product especially if you get it on sale
3,not very exciting it reminded me of eating the sponge cake part of a twinkie without the fun of the cream filled center would make a good cake base for a fruit topping but it doesnt stand up well alone
3,the product is good but very less battery life
3,although i bought sizes down from my regular size they were still big and made my derriere look flat i would have kept them as weekend kickaround jeans but the flat behind just made them a must return
3,the kimono is as pictured the colors are true to what is shown on line though the description indicates green multiit is not green i returned the item however the quality is fine but it seemed extremely overpriced to me it seems to me that half the price would be fair for the quality
3,i dont know that ill keep this although i really want to i love the style and the fabric and the length is perfect for me im and i ordered the petite length it hits me below the knee as another reviewer mentioned this dress runs small in the chest area and does not provide any stretch luckily for me that wasnt an issue my trouble is this the liner stops just above the slits on the side and its way more noticeable in person than in the photo the liner is sewn in and yo
3,finally this was so very much lee childs jack reacher i bingewatched reacher this past weekend and loved every minute i too was disappointed with the casting tom cruise is big box office but it seemed like another mission impossible to the few who complained about the dialogdid you read the novels alan ritchson was a great jack reacher whens the next flight
3,by far one of the most original and well thought storylines you will be on the edge of your seat every episode wow
3,ultimately value for money
3,if you are a person who loves classic movies and series you would fall head over heels for this one i have never played the game and i am happy i didint bcuz the show comes as a totally new storyline which you would be mesmerised with simply put the headline of the show tells you its a story about the last of us that means the people left behind its not the zombie apocalypse movie which you think it is every character in the movie is well developed the action and emotional sequences are heart touching hats off to joel and ellie they both have acted exceptionally overall the show will make you cry and laugh and jump off ur seat too absolutely loved it well done hbo
3,im in love with thomas shelby i love the time they act in they are all great actors
3,if you have muscular thighs like me these wont fit well im usually a size fittedrelaxed i bought these in a large and the shins were the most relaxed part had to return for not fitting well but the quality of the product was nice
3,the core struggle of star wars is freedom versus oppression and the mysticism is just a layer to build a better mythology andor presents the natural progression and dynamics of the innate desire for freedom which the empire cannot fathom all this is presented through compelling characters with complex backgrounds with superb acting and by far the best dialogue star wars has even produced whats more is that it is not paced like most modern shows having a mandatory fight sequence every minutes it takes its time and builds the tension producing a far better payoff than anything forced conflict here carries real weight and the emotions of people related to it are what drive the story forward when it happens you are genuinely invested and on the edge of your seat cheering the protagonists on or crying for their losses its epic and moving perhaps the only problem with andor is that it shows what star wars could actually be if placed in the right hands not copying the originals lifelessly or destroying its characters or just providing endless nostalgia or baby yoda with intermittent fight scenes now there is a new bar set with rogue one to support it and we can never look at star wars the same way if we dont get more ill start my own rebellion
3,really wanted to love this especially with the lacing and long length for this offtheshoulder top when the top arrived the lacing was stiff and length of the straps were long so that the bottom of the lace didnt completely cover my black strapless bra and i felt it sat a bit too low down my chest thought about taking in the straps but then the area around the armpits would be uncomfortable i did love the length of the top though wish this top was a keeper but going to have to return
3,it was okay a lot of oatmeal flavor and not enough cinnamon i like my recipe for apple betty much better
3,in this not window program its so hurts
3,i received this shirt in my typical xs and it fits perfectly im not crazy in love with it but i also dont dislike the shirt is on the thin side do i need to wear a cami underneath it no my concern is holes it does remind me of a material that could develop some holes after some wear and washes with that being said ill wash this shirt in cold water and hang dry and hopefully that will prevent holes from developing the length is fine and i do like the slits in frontit adds a little dim
3,having grown up on mexican food we never used corn tortillas always flour this was too salty and all the spices left us drinking a lot of water dredging the tortillas in the sauce before filling and rolling would make them look more authentic
3,first of all it is an honor to write the th review for this series i am normally not the tv series guy but this series was awesome and very quick to watch the whole cast does an amazing job and it is a fun to watch the series consists of eight episodes of minutes runtime each i would not call it family friendly as it contains explicit scenes of violence however i would not rate it much more brutal than the harry potter movies which obviously served as a template here there are many similarities like a school of special kids and teachers mysteries to be solved and an arch nemesis to beat i really loved watching this and looking forward to season
3,this dress in coral is a beautiful color and awesome material only problem is it runs a little big i am a pretty true to size small and shouldve ordered an xs the hips are a little wide and v in the neck a little low instead of sending back i just wore a camisole and leggings w ankle boots and it looked very cute regardless
3,do you need to let the yeast wake up before you start mixing in the remaining yeast
3,i wasnt expecting much my wife watched the first episode and told me this was great i have to watch it it had all the hallmarks of a bad netflix reboot were going to take an old franchise refocus on a young female character introduce a bunch of new characters and make something entirely unlike the window dressing of the franchise were using to trick you into watching it and it is exactly that but its actually good apparently you can do all of that and it doesnt have to be horrible the title character wednesday is portrayed very well by jenny ortega who manages to be funny and charismatic in the role while being true to wednesdays dark and angsty personality the plot is interesting and the mysteries of the show are engaging and satisfying even the teen drama aspects which i was fully prepared to cringe at were handled well the characters felt like real people dealing with real problems even when they were silly supernatural creatures dealing with ridiculous supernatural problems even when the interactions carried obvious social justice messages it didnt feel preachy or like some school antibullying video the only big negative for me was that the show seemed to have a hard time with the balancing act between wednesdays character as an antisocial psychopath who loves death and murder and the fact that wednesday is also supposed to be our protagonist whos really a good person and cares about everybody and does the right thing the nice thing etc there were a few moments when i found myself thinking okay so shes a actually a big sweetheart pretending to be wednesday addams but overall loved this and i was pleasantly surprised
3,season one was somewhat ok despite dragging on slightly however season is diabolical this show just goes around in circles with no real development so many scenes and episodes that have been dragged out for no reason you can actually fast forward entire sections and still miss nothing
3,okay but probably wont make again
3,this was a fun cake to makevery simply and very good didnt miss the frosting at all
3,i was so excited to order this beautiful coat it does seem well made and is very soft unfortunately the fit is completely off and is overall large i ordered a small as this coat appears slightly more snug on top aline on the bottom with three buttons i am and weigh approximately i was expecting this coat to be bodyskimming instead it was overall large and the bottom of the coat awkwardly flared the pleat on the back is unflattering sadly going back
3,the product has low builtin quality the battery exhaust very soon the performance as per the specs are not ok
3,very pretty romantic
3,haunting yet intriguing one of the best dystopian drama shows ive ever watched it is unsettling to watch of a world where such barbarism exists and is encouraged by religion almost each episode in this show has a scene that is gut wrenching and paints a vivid picture which stays in mind and gives a lasting heart sinking feeling the story although fictional raises concerns about how valid it is in the real modern world too religious fanatics exist even today and given enough power they wont hesitate to take the world back a years it made me contemplate on how we have to always strive towards progressing forward and do everything we can to never allow the world to be governed exclusively on religion elizabeth moss is perfect for the character of june osborn im amazed by how well shes acted and how well the character suits her remarkable acting excellent direction amazing storyline and great bgm and camera work recommended edit i was depressed for quite some time after binging this shows season in one week i wouldnt suggest this show to anyone whos depressed already or going through a low point in life
3,when i received this tank i ordered the blue i almost returned it because it seemed really thin almost see through however once i tried it on it had a good fit not see through just lightweight and breezy i especially like the twisted details on the straps i would suggest a bralette with a cross back for comfort especially because it is on the thin side
3,henry cavill is perfect in his role as gerald the hole show is a must watch
3,i didnt have as much of a problem with the sheer fabric as the other reviewers but this dress is incredibly long and large especially compared to the picture for reference im usually a in retailer dresses and the small was huge on me particularly on the bottom half i was very disappointed because this dress looks so cute online
3,just so im clear the only reason i said it runs large is bc of the top portion but the bottom or waist loved this romper when i saw it online it was however too big in the top portion the straps are adjustable but the back is too low for a bra and it gaps too much in the front unless you are standing straight all day also bc im the small was just a tad too short definitely no bending im tall lbs with an average size chest c i ordered a small and the bottom
3,having watched star wars from the beginning i am so thankful that shows like the mandalorian are being created tbh the latest additions to the canon sw were ordinary everything after the return of the jedi but shows n movies like rogue squadron and the mandalorian are brilliant and i love what is being produced keep up the good work and may the force be with you
3,the one i tried on had something wrong with the pockets one was regular heightt eh other was so low i could barely put my hand in it however the jumpsuit itself is really pretty and soft color is nice but hard ot pull off on pale skin like me i tried on the xs but that was big i would need xxs p if it was made in that size so i let it go looked nice with pinched fabric in the back for reference i am lbs dd in waist
3,its not as form fitting hourglass shaped in real life as on the model i think they must have clipped it in the small of her back so it does not look so boxy otherwise its nice
3,loved the first cruise jack reacher second not so much this one falls between them one mess up grain mm bullet is not subsonic gram which is grain is slight screw up
3,i love the look of this dress had high hopes but it didnt live up to them have no doubt that it is well made beautiful fully lined with lovely detailing around the neck i am lbs with a postpartum belly that id like to hide so i chose this dress as the reviews say its a bit loose forgiving i found it to be so loose that it looks big entirely hides my figure i considered ordering a small but knew that it was simply the cut of the dress going down a size wouldnt chang
3,this is the show anyone who grew up with classic star wars needs to see mature star wars if you will maintains the aesthetics of rogue one and has a quality of writing to shame recent pathetic efforts stands as a great little scifi adventure on its own within the star wars universe terrific production script and depth of accomplished acting performances tremendous give it a gravitas to have you salivating if you ever so much as tingled at any great star wars movie one particular visual snippet as an example se the eye has tie fighter pilots scrambling into their machines mere seconds of screen time but a scintillating burst of realisation that such dynamic moments have never been authentically presented to you before ally that with engaging and stimulating dialogue and it delivers some great stuff treat you inner kid and impress your critical adult dont miss out on giving this quality production the attention and admiration it deserves this is rogue one the rd greatest star wars movie behind iv v expanded and climbing
3,this top is oversized i normally wear large but thought an xl would be best for sleeping its huge so stick with your normal size or a size down pretty print fabric is a bit coarse undecided about trying a size down because im particular and they didnt wow me also ordered these in the lighter color and they fit the same
3,this is a flattering comfortable soft sweater the instant you put it on a few instants after that however i found mine had relaxed a great deal to become baggy and pilled even more to become a fuzzy wuzzy monstrosity im not optimistic about its longevity and wouldnt recommend it except for the extravagant singleuse buyer
3,this is the problem usb charger does not support and mouse pad not working properly
3,it was okay but way too thin of a soup for my liking i eliminated the additional c of liquid called for near the end and added another can of cream of mushroom soup and a c of minute rice to thicken it up
3,product is ok but dont believe on no cost emi bank is taking extra charge and intrest i have taken for month
3,i have other pairs of stevie jeans and looked forward to receiving thesei would say that they run about a size large compared to my other pairs i am and ordered a petite but i found the length to be about inches too long as compared to how they look on the model also the rise is relatively low otherwise the quality is great and the denim is very soft i will probably return these given that i am not wowed
3,get rid of the cottage cheese super gross use ricotta instead
3,the fabric and color of this dress is beautiful two problems with the dress that the picture does not show its long im this model must be over feet tall as the length hit inches above my ankle and that is not a flattering length the other issue is that there is toile underneath making the skirt extra puffy im and the puffiness reminded me of prom color and fabric great but had to send back
3,peaky blinders is in the realm of early game of thrones and the sorpranos throw in godfather one and two for good measure i dont smoke but the jameson flows heavily in this house and lastly cillian murphy as tommy shelby has the best pokerface this side of clint eastwood simply epic in every way
3,this design looks really sharp on the image but in reality this jacket felt more like a jacket you would get at forever xxi the fabric had that polyestershiny quality to it that made it look cheap since the fabric was pretty soft with a gray jersey lining it felt more like a padded jacket than a constructed blazer i also thought the cut was small if you have a bust larger than a b i felt like i was busting out of a size and i am a d
3,these ran true to size but the fabric is very stiff and unforgiving im athletic and have lean legs but these seemed to cling to and roll on every dimple on my thigh and sitting down was uncomfortable at the knees because of the stiff fabric i loved how they fit at the waist but the legs just didnt work for me sadly returning these
3,absolutely brilliant amazing show cannot wait for the story to continue in the season and what is the absolute proof that mandalorian will get you too even those who gave the show bad review watched all the episodes from season funny and solid proof of how entertaining show it is excellent
3,good product but fingerprint button missing in this laptop thats not good
3,its rare for a dress to completely not work on me but this dress completely did not work on me im tall and have an hourglass figure i got this dress in my usual size s this dress somehow made me look ridiculously pear shaped the empire type bust of the dress made both my bust c and my waist look pretty much nonexistent it looked so bad on me i actually laughed its a shame though because i had been eyeing this dress for a long time and it is a beautiful dress but i would not rec
3,condiserably better then disneys frustratingly lackluster moneygrabbing attempts so far yet still lags behind the multitude of well written well executed shows of recent years chernobyl the terror s fargo s etc this series shows how easy it could have been to avoid the disaster new start wars turned out to be all this show does is present a nice production design with a relatively unimaginative writing and ok direction and yet everyone seems to love it because star wars overall this show is a huge step in the right direction stellar even compared to recent star wars average and a little cliche on its own merit
3,like many here mine failed and i lost my data but being smart i had a backup after further investigation i found this product is not compatible with android and a number of devices cameras phones gps unit windows seems to love it though wish i had a windows device that could use g my only one uses a whopping k at best what a wasteupdate reformated is as fat and works ok in my android devices and my sony camera for about months now still i keep a hot quick backup ota every day to my desktop computer ill just say im not confident in it yet
3,ive been searching for a pretty and unique party top and thought this was it it is beautiful and unique but much too cropped for me and im only sadly i had to return maybe would be more appropriate on someone younger
3,because while i liked it i didnt love it this would have been something i would of liked to take my daughter to see when she was a tween i didnt really like how any of the adams were cast whilst catherine zeta jones looked amazing she was hit or miss in her acting i love luis guzman but dont think that was a part he was really suited for and the guy who played uncle fester dont know his name was awful and as for wednesdayjenna ortega i wasnt thrilled with her her acting is very one note christina rcci was much better as was the cast of the s movie any ways this was entertaining enough the costumes filming etc was done well and i did enjoy it its a decent watch for the evening and much better than most of the recent series releases on netflix
3,i too was dubious about the dry clean only label but purchased it anyway because it was really cute and comfortable the shorts part is lined which is nice not see through the waist is a smocking with elastic its also very thin thread the first one i tried on had a couple of stitches ripped in this waistband and because of that the fabric sort of bubbled out i bought a different one knowing it was delicate this isnt a romper your going to want to shimmy over your hips because of
3,this top is cut too short wide with too much light material in between to be truly slimming flattering it needs to have more of the rayonspandex blend to make it heavier bouncier then it would hang appropriately and swing and hopefully not add pounds to the wearer unfortunately this top is too lightweight has too much material pass
3,i tried this on in white and considered whether or not i wanted just another coverup in the final analysis even at off it just hung there if thats what youre after then this is for you
3,if you are like me and your shoulders are broader than your hips the boatneck on this wont be too wide on you i am normally a m or l in retailer tops and went with the m and i have very large biceps if youre broadshouldered but have smaller arms i would recommended sizing down a size i have a very long torso and didnt find this to be too shortbut i love jeans with a rise if you are going to pair this with low or medium rise jeans then yes you will
3,look i really wanted to like this but theres very little about it that feels star wars to me it almost feels like someone created a totally different space drama and the idea was to slap the name star wars on it in order to popularize it and yes i know its getting outstanding reviews but it almost feels like the opposite of the fake trolling that came with the actual films for the first two episodes i waited for something of substance to happen and each time the credits came on i was left wondering what the point was the actors are fine but the pace of the story prevents them from delivering full compelling performances i commend them for attempting to take a more adult stab at this franchise but im not seeing the gripping aspect of this that makes me want more as i am a huge star wars fan ill continue to give this a chance though i have to say not the strongest start
3,computer started hanging within days o
3,bigger budget doesnt always translate to a better film and the witcher is a perfect example of that everything that was great about the first season is traded for a boring slow paced series
3,miller i am calling you out hopefully you read this at some point i just finished season handmaids tale is phenomenal but this was seasons with no real progress in a very hopeless universe i swear by the eye and all that is holy if something progressive and positive dont happen in the third season the show will diminish and suffer the same fate as the wd the fans gave up it was too hopeless with no progress please please dont let this happen to handmaids tale
3,i am on the fence about this dress the fabric is gorgeous and soft however i was hoping the fit was more slouchy like pictures on the model it was much shorter on me that pictured for reference i am and the turtle neck part of the dress is kind of high and tight i wanted to love this so much but it is a touch off from what i was hoping it was going to be
3,this is soooo much more cropped than it looks in the picture the fabric is super soft and design is cute i really wanted to like this but it just doesnt fit as shown the back is halfway up by back and i am shortwaisted
3,product was ok for general office work took too much time to deliver at k it is high for amd processor
3,i loved this blouse but had to return i am lbs d i found that the blouse was tight in the bust and very wide in the shoulders the sleeves are puffy which is fine but the wideness is from edge of the bib to where the sleeve is attached and therefore the top did not lay flat if you have wide shoulders and a small bust this blouse will be perfect for you i liked the material it was thin but perfect for a summer nights
3,good laptop fast processor lan port missing so may be issue those who want to connect ethernet very disappoint with ekart delivery
3,the show is so similar to the game but still has time to add more details it also doesnt track off of the main reasoning of the game and stays on topic all of the time its so compelling and shows how hard it is for a dad that lost a daughter to live on in a world with many losses also the actors are amazing they are so good at giving emotions and keep giving action the vfx is also really good many explosions where made really good this show is just amazing i think of you like zombie apocalypse movies and shows or just like this game i suggest you watch this no wonder it got cant wait for new episodes
3,battery will last about hours with light work load if you can compromise on battery then you can go for it update fingerprint sensor is faulty overheating issue
3,i never read the books but i played the video games this story seems to walk its own path and its better for it the witcher and his bard companion are a fantastic duo navigating a fantasy landscape equally brutal and darkly humorous give this show a try
3,i really liked the style of this top but its way oversized im petite and drowned in this top even though i got it in an xs the material is nice but i cant see i had a feeling for the cut because it runs so big this one is going back to the store
3,liked the episode but when they went back to the garrison it was back to how it looked in season and not how it looked after the rebuild and reopened in season what gives
3,im not in love with this but the husband thinks it looks cute and the sale price isnt bad so im keeping it i got it in s and am usually an xs or s in retailer tops b inch waist lbs if i had gone with xs it probably wouldve been too tight in the shoulders however i could be months pregnant and you wouldnt know it it is very boxy in the torso and i realize the design is for it to be flowy as the back is partially split but it looks relatively fitted on the model which is
3,i usually wear small ordered xs and its still way too large quality not that great just meh returning it
3,everything is ok buti couldnt able to find fingerprint battery is not upto hrs onky about or hours just
3,disclaimer i have neither played the game or read the books that the series is based on so my review is based on the merits of the show on its own the show jumps a lot in time and does nothing to tell the viewer that it has jumped or how far some scenes happen in the present while others happen decades in the past helpful things like say showing a place and a date when a new string of story is told seems to be too hard for the showrunners to include so they neither show nor tell this makes the plot weird and hard to follow eg why does our hero go around doing odd jobs when he knows that there is a little girl in big trouble the answer is that he does not because we have jumped umpteen years into the past having seen the show i see little reason for the story to not be told sequentially if i am so unhappy with this why did i give the show an above average grade well there is actually a good show in there most of the characters are interesting understandable and display actual character growth for plausible reasons which is uncommon the story line is mostly engaging even though i would have liked a bit more world building and i could not see why i should care about the international conflict there is way too much destiny me this and destiny me that if everything is resolved by destiny where is the dramatic tension the dialog is mostly good but has some weird oneliners especially in the first few episodes the set and costumes are good as are the special effects
3,it was ok maybe use less chicken next time
3,performance is amazing but display is worst no backlit keyboard
3,i am just finishing up season one first it could have been a great drama without the over the top forced comedy the characters are almost caricatures so obviously written still some are likable i felt sorry for the son quin adrift in his dysfunctional family at times the actions strain credibility quins sister and friend force him to sleep in the hot kitchen then outside i suppose its possible several other characters actions also stretch belief i suppose thats the comedy the cinematography is beautiful but hey its hawaii the lush scenery is put to good use the music is at times enjoyable but sometimes too loud and intrusive distracting from the dialogue or maybe thats on purpose to enhance otherwise mundane writing this reminded me of nine perfect strangers which i enjoyed but that had more going for it in substance and writing i will go on to season two hoping for a better experience
3,like it
3,cant remember the last time i bingewatched a series in a day all the characters were perfect they all crushed it im really hoping they can churn these out pretty quickly sad we dont see roscoe again i dont think but given her performance in this i dont think she will have any trouble finding other projects i think one of the things they got so well in this series is that reacher is fairly stoic so the other characters have to react to him to create emotion particularly with their expressions and body language there is always that why are you not afraidworriedselfdoubting feeling running through the other characters yet reacher remains relentless and a rock through the whole thing character development is for everyone else they all become better people for having him around but reacher remains reacher the scriptwriters and the director deserve credit for realizing this and translating it to the screen having said that cant say enough about ritchsons performance it wasnt just his size he got reacher right in every way particularly in the context of the first book where he was just that juggernaut of vengeance in later books he becomes a bit more nuanced and one cant help noticing how well he nailed that man with no name vibe from clint eastwoods spaghetti westerns i dont give s particularly freely but this one deserves it because it was so anticipated people had their doubts and the trailer wasnt the best more please
3,i thought this was pretty goodadded garlic cause i think spaghetti has to have garlic lol
3,i so badly wanted this top to work it looks so cute but as soon as i tried it on i knew it wasnt a keeper i didnt even need a mirror its not suited for those of us with a bust im a d and anything but a lanky modelesque frame i suggest sizing up if youre busty and want to give it a try it looked dowdy on me
3,i really liked this cheesecake but it is very rich its not real great for after a big meal but it is delicious if you have an empty stomach
3,this is an absolutely beautiful skirt from the front gives a perfect hourgass shape with the strategic color blocking however if you have shapely hips and backside this will definitely emphasize that had to take it back a little bit much for work and other formalprofessional events however if youre less endowed in that area it might work well gives a great shape
3,beautiful fabric but the fit was off the picture makes the dress appear fitted than it actually is the belt is definitely needed but would leave a lot of fabric in the back of the dress giving it a less than tailored look also the arms and the top portion are a tad small so if you have a larger bustarms this dress may be tricky i am a b and the button in the xxsp was puckering a biti was really looking forward to this one for fall but was no way for me to make it work
3,as a petite big busted woman i found this dress wildly unflattering the quality and pattern of the dress itself is beautiful though it will require a slip as it is completely transparent the design of the bust however i found unflattering
3,bought this on a whim i had been wanting a new maxi dress and the bodice looked really cool online ordered it in black it fits true to size however the material is a bit on the thin side and where the fabric crosses over on the lower waist lineit leaves a love handle lump without the bulk it would be great as overall look is kind of cool however i am on the fence on this one for the money there are better maxis out there
3,i really love this seriesits exciting and heartbreaking i think something like this could actually happen in some fanatic sects all over the world looking forward to season
3,these lightweight wide leg pilcro summer jeans are really cute but did not look good on me i love the fabrica slightly nubby no stretch chambray that is perfect for hot weather the waist was a bit large and there was fabric to spare in the hip area the legs are very wide adding to the comfort factor of these the details are really cutecontrasting fabric at the slash front and rear pockets i got a size ten in these and they were bigi can imagine they will stretch out with wear so it
3,thought season was such a bore and almost didnt watch season but decided to watch the first episode to try couldnt put down season so much better also you can watch season without watching season as theyre independent so i recommend skipping season altogether very boring thought season was such a bore and almost didnt watch season but decided to watch the first episode to try couldnt put down season so much better also you can watch season without watching season as theyre independent so i recommend skipping season altogether very boring hfjdncmckcncnc
3,i dont care about the negative comments they are always salty people around writing their cheap critics but i knew this series going to booooommmm and so its did many compering the witcher to got well to you guys better back off its two different world but anyway i loved got charactersand still the end was bitter and felt like a big disappointing the witcher deserve that attension and i m so glad to see every episode so for me its a masterpiecei cant wait for the next season
3,after all the star reviews i expected more it was easy and tasted good but it wasnt some amazing recipe i would make it again but i am not putting it on my regular dinner menu
3,exemplory acting by god i am a big fan of this series cillian murphy tom hardyi wish i have watched this series the most amazing series to watch ehtommyshelby
3,this dress is awesome love everything about it except the colors the pink is ridiculous it is like pepto on crack theres no way outside of being a bridesmaid i would ever wear that shade of pink nauseating i would order the turquoise but i dont think i want that either plus the pink was the only color offered in the store even though i saw the dress offered in black online at one time why wouldnt you stock the black instore i can no longer get it you need to offer this d
3,i bought two of these gb microsd cards which i formatted to fat and i currently have about gb in files on each card i carry one card in my wallet and keep one in a safe deposit offsite ive been through the sandisk literature looking to see if there are any restrictions on their use other than as ordinary flash memory for file storage there are no restrictions i could find what i have found is that these gb cards and a sandisk gb card i bought previously cannot accept gb of data written from a computer without suffering errors ive had to resort to copying no more than gb of data at a time to these cards stopping then starting another gb until the complete data is copied the errors actually occur early on at approximately the to gb point i have several other gb flash memory sticks the lexar echo series as well as a hundred other lowercapacity flash memory cards and do not have this overflowerror problem with any of those to repeat there are no restrictions on the use of these memory cards example can be used only in a camera given by sandisk and given that the gb of data on each card has been verified as to integrity they are not defective
3,could not stop binge watching this series cant believe i just started watching this first thing to thank covid for lol would recommend to any adult the acting is superb and the story line is awesome
3,the story is amazing all the actresses are so great especially lisa as a debut actress i think she did a great job anyway im looking forward to see whats coming next and more of lisas performance im new for this series but already a big fan and i cant believe that i didnt watch the white lotus series before such a waste im just obsessed with all the story around rich people and i cant believe i like it but i heard that there were some shock scenes happened in the pre season it make me worry a little bit but still excited overall it is worth watching and those who have not seen it should see immediately
3,i found it hard to pair with bottoms fit wasnt very flattering for me
3,i recommen only becuase i like it on other people but not on me the pull on style didnt work i need xs petite to fit lenght and waist but the waist wasnt elastic enough to pull up i have lets say a booty i kept hearing hte stiching give it also looked a little too poooofffy on my frmae i am and it stuck more out than on the model nice idea btu not for me i am lbs
3,please give high altitude adjustments many of us live above feet they come out flat i want big fluffy cookies please give high altitude adjustments for this an all your recipes
3,ive enjoyed this show i love reachers dry humor if it can even be called that ignore the negative nancy reviews did the show get you as invested as goliath or bosch i dont think so but its also in a category of its own im hoping for another season
3,i ordered the pink in size xl the color was pretty the problem is the material was too thin and tight it ran at least a size smaller than shown in the photos online
3,ahhh i should have listened to previous reviews indeed this top runs very large style wise it is ok i would say you could do much better at retailer
3,anyone who says this is another gangster show is kidding themselves its definitely not just another gangster show its different for the better this is probably the most unique series out there and im not even exaggerating ive never seen a show like this before the writing is brilliant the acting is phenomenal the directing is outstanding you never get bored of it you always want more cillian murphy fits perfectly thomas shelbys character as does the rest of the cast in each role its really a shame that this masterpiece is coming to an end notice dont mind the negative reviews its just trolls or people who like to hate and cant understand this show good job bbc and mr steven knight
3,this top is pretty and i did not find it sheer at all but i am returning it due to the lace sleeves are tight but i do have large arms other than the sleeves i would keep it
3,ive been a massive skeptic and living in complete fear since the series was announced ive never left a review for a series or film and ill never leave one after this if youre a true fan of the gamesthis everything youve been waiting for finally a bridge between video games and cinema so my mom and i have something to talk about its a beautiful thing when they dont completely massacre and desecrate one of the only good things in the world and the creators care about the characters as much as the original audience does i didnt think it would be possible to elevate something that was perfect to begin with but here we are ive been waiting for this day since and ive never been more excited to have my heart broken into a million pieces all over again
3,the jacket is cute it runs small but looks good i like it even though it feels tight on my arms
3,lifetime star wars fan despite many recent damp quibs especially boba fett quite simply andor makes the whole saga relatable you can really get a feel for what made the rebellion and how oppressive the empire was each character is deep well written and acted for me it probably wouldnt work as a stand alone but it underpins all that has gone before and makes the fantasy soemething that is more believable and understandable the relatively insignificant in the context of the movies challenges that andor faces throughout help to convey the frustration of being under emire control as such you find yourself routing for and celebrating each win as much as a movie ending battle absolutely loved this
3,lately weve gotten used to series that have the same production value of big budget movies the witcher is more along what you would have expected a tv show to look like albeit years ago this would have been extremely good quality for a tv show therefore it isnt bad per se actors script and cinematography are along the lines of tv shows not movies weve simply been sploilt by ridiculously good quality series lately
3,these were not bad but were dense with no leavening and just didnt seem quite right might be worth trying to add some baking powder because the flavor was pretty good apart from it had a slight eggy flavor
3,very nice as from previous descriptions piles already inserted but since in the package is indicated of music and qs after only breaths turns off there is something wrong
3,i really like the pilcro serif style but the stet style does not work for my body will have to return
3,overall the top is cute what doesnt show in the photo are the pleats on the shoulderneck area the placement of the pleats makes you look like you have a football player neck the neck area doesnt lay flat but comes off as puffy at your neck ive never seen pleats placed in such a spot ruined an otherwise cute top
3,i ordered this in a size and it is great quality the only problem is the size of the slip the top is very tight across my average chest but fine elsewhere odd fit the dress fits great and i debated finding another slip but ultimately decided to return it
3,this top looks much nicer on the model than inperson i tried it on it didnt look flattering and was shorter than i like in the picture i really like the top with the design and frills on the side gives the model a waist inperson the design doesnt stand out much and the frills look wrinkledit is also sweatshirt material and a tad stiff i am sending it back it just didnt look as flattering also it seemed more fitted at the top than bottom
3,i usually wear an which wasnt available and sized up to the which fit just fine as there is no stretch and its a setin waist band the fabric is pretty the skirt is fully lined the length is not too short and the only thing i dont like is the big bronzey toothed zipper it looks ok on the beige version but on the black it stands out its perfect for summer but i could also see wearing the black version during holidays
3,product did not on on arrival it took hours for the laptop to on after charging good features
3,specifications given on display page like ms office month subscription are ullu banaving others are good
3,anyone know how to make this a slow cooker recipe
3,this is a nice base but if you even have a little bit of concern for your health i know were talking a chowder here this thing is an absolute saltsodium bomb i tried it as is the first time and modified the next to bring it down first i know its delicious but skip the bacon and sautee the vegetables in a little butter reduce the chicken bouillon which is the main culprit of unnecessary sodium down to just half a teaspoon switch to black pepper to amp up the flavoring a little and cook the rest as recommended incidentally the modified version tasted much more like authentic clam chowder from new england
3,i got this as a gift and one for me the medium fits my mom but i got the large because im and it was large enough but so short waisted i wouldnt recommend it for women over
3,question the stores no longer stock bouillon granules what can be used instead this soup looks and sounds wonderful
3,i found it very thin and much more sheer than i expected not sure i could get away with wearing it without a slipsadly ill be returning it also runs a bit large would have returned it for an xs if i loved it
3,this sweater dress color is great and texture is nice however ran huge read the other reviews before ordering and ordered down to a medium and was just to boxy and could not get it to hang well unfortunately it went back
3,not the best antiperspirant out there unless you like going to work with a snow drift under your arm
3,very nice
3,this shirt is so cute i ordered a white but will have to return it for a different color the white is very sheershee through
3,this dress is really cute in person however it did not fit me like it does the model in the pic at all first of all im feet and it was wayyy too short on me i didnt have the petit on either i had the regular xs it just hits a couple of inches too short for me i am it would be adorable if i were more comfortable in shorter dresses i wear short things a lot but this was just too high on me it was probably a good inches above my knee also it flared too dramatically at the wa
3,although not the most original of plots most direct and noticeably comparison being the logan film it still uses it to explore a engrossing and devastating world filled with emotionally complex characters that seem to only grow deeper with each episode pedro pascal seems to only reveal his true talents with each and passing episode and bella ramsey masterfully depicts a teenager who has a hard time listening to and following orders their chemistry is amazing and highly relatable to anyone who has difficulty talking to their father each episode also masterfully and creatively connects to the series main theme that makes its obvious once you know what it is hint the theme has something to do with love im so glad to hear that the dreaded video game curse has finally be broken after so many attempts
3,liked it so far creatuesdesign is good and it feels a bit like a mix of game of thrones and the last kingdom i liked the first season the action was huge and great good characters but it felt like the witcher himself hasnt had to do as much as other characters in the big scequence
3,tastes good enough a lot of steps my family just wasnt a big fan
3,lasted about months of daily use in my android phone but yesterday it stopped performing writes and then failed altogether while it was working reads were incredibly fast and writes were pretty good as well
3,this top is not for a curvy figure the embroidered part is gorgeous very stunning but the loose bottom part is awful i am curvy and usually wear l or xl this top was fitted at the top but very loose at the bottom made me feel like i had a big tummy and was a tad short i am sending this back this would look better on a more slender frame
3,the best thing about the show is the lead actress she is born for the role and played it to perfection the storyline is good if you like teen drama if you think about story its really a mixture of harry potter and xmen a bornagain monster outcast students who have special talents final showdown between the monster and the chosen one and the death of the principle the headmaster sounds awfully familiar doesnt it guess its hard to be original nowadays started out really strong and quite a number of twists and turns but overall storyline is not that innovative but again i still recommend it for the performance of ortega she is exceptional
3,its quite good for normal working
3,loved the print on this dress however the fit wasnt for me i feel like it exaggerated my belly and just overall i didnt feel great in it the sleeves were also really big
3,i have read every book in order and the first killing floor is one of the best this tv series really captures the books quality great acting script and direction can not wait for next season
3,this top is beautiful in color and fabric unfortunately just didnt work in the breast line gapped and there was just nothing i could do to make it hang correctly im not really large in the chest area b but the large just didnt work had to send it back
3,nice jeans just fyi they look more slimly fitted in the photo than they actually are when you get them thats why i returned them otherwise fine
3,on me this was not good at all couldnt get it off fast enough the thick stretchy fabric instantly added bulk to my frame and the leaf pattern over my mid section emphasized my belly and im a size also the color is a dark brick red and i think if it had been a true red it would have been much more attractive
3,dress looks awesome when your arms are down like the model but dont you dare lift your arms im kinda tall and the dress barely covers my bum when arms are raised keeping the dress but will have to keep my arms down maybe
3,i love this dress but it is too short to keep i am and weigh lbs most of my cloths from retailer are either a size or a small but this dress is substantially shorter than other dresses purchased from retailer it looks adorable on but it is just too short about inches above my knees to be considered professional enough to wear to work
3,brilliant how an action star should look and act seems like an old s action hero excellent the story is good too kept guessing for a while recommend to every one
3,overall the dress is beautiful easy and great quality but the bottom part has more fabric than it appears in the photo if that makes sense its not poofy or superlayered but i had to pinch fabric on a part of the dress in order for it to have that more straightshift shape that you see online here besides that bottom part the fit is true to size but as a petit the extra fabric isnt what im looking for i think it works depending on what youre looking for beautiful though
3,i tried these on because the color is really pretty and fun and who donset want a pair of comfycute pants but they looked awful on my muscular thighs i dont think the cut will be falttering on of the population also not as comfortable as they looked the crotch seemed a little low on me though the pants were in the correct size
3,i am a and ordered the ml its very large i normally take a large in retailer but i cant figure out my size in this its very wide i love the denim patchwork detail so i will order the sm and see how it is
3,i have watched all five seasons what an amazing series this is a series well worth watching with sibling rivalry issues between the white men and indians issues with government and people in power plus moments of viewing a beautiful land we all take for granted i loved seeing the cowboys in action rounding up the cattle the talent they had riding the horses the beauty of the land and the hardship they experienced plus love and death and romance with revenge and peace and lessons learned and how it all came to an end season five the finale was such a tear jerker to me have watched all five seasons a good binge watch series
3,we have had to endure absolute tripe movies so far and a third probably on the way this december before the dark side looks like it has been beaten into submission with this series superb all round and please someone write this guy jon favreau a blank cheque for at least movies in the same vein feels like star warslooks like star warsit is star wars great job and long may they continue
3,product all goods value for money but ms office not included permanently
3,the noise level of the machine has become much louder over time and interferes with falling asleep
3,what do you get when you combine a compelling story first rate writing and the finest acting seen in a long time the answer is the handmaids tale one of the local tv stations was streaming the entire series on its website i started watching on sunday afternoon and had finished all episodes by the following night this was simply tv drama at its finest if elizabeth moss does not win an emmy for best actress and yvonne strahovski for best supporting actress there is no justice in this world out of
3,i liked the look of the tunic sweater and it was very soft i am lbs and tried on the xs the arms felt a bit tight but overall it fit well and i liked the length i did not like how high the hem was split though i would ideally like to wear these with a pair of leggings and wish the hem was split just a little lower and not right at my hip the material was very soft but i felt like it was a bit cheap for the price
3,i wanted this dress so bad for a trip to hawaii i sized up when i saw the side zip because im a little larger in the top than bottom but whoa even when sizing up i think i would have needed to size up like x to get this to work the dress is adorable and if you have a smaller bust it will work for you so sad it wouldnt work for me
3,if youre in need of good tv this show will do it for those who cant get into it because its slow i know the feeling bc after episodes of breaking bad i was ready to shoot myself however this show is definitely worth sticking it out this is definitely one of my top favorite shows to get an idea of my idea of good tv im a big got fan in my opinion this is the next best thing to fill your got void
3,im a bottom and a on top so im curvy which makes onepiece swimsuits hard to shop for i ordered a m l and while the m overall fit me better the cup size was still way too big on me im a d and i need another set of my girls to fit into the cups otherwise this swimsuit is so beautiful
3,why is you buy a gb card and when you install it you have only gb exactly where does that gb i paid forgo to
3,a great imaginative story good acting good direction gripping narration not only is an impressive landscape built into the story the buildings and settlements are also designed with a lot of creative imagination it is a pleasure to follow this series and see the creative efforts that have gone into it
3,maybe i just have the wrong body type for these jeans but even though they technically fit i felt like they looked like mom jeans on me i was fine with the high waist which actually made them very comfortable but the ankles were loose and long on me where most ag ankle jeans are a perfect length the quality is good thoughthe fabric is substantial and a bit stiffer than most of my other ags and the color is a nice saturated black i tried on a size and im lbs
3,the first season was a blast the second was even better the third is a turd the acting in all of the three was great the writing in the third was pathetic here go some more characters dont bother reading them cause they are there just to fulfil imdb requirements or do bother it is a quote by kurt vonnegut hello babies welcome to earth its hot in the summer and cold in the winter its round and wet and crowded on the outside babies youve got a hundred years here theres only one rule that i know of babies god damn it youve got to be kind and also tiger got to hunt bird got to fly man got to sit and wonder why why why tiger got to sleep bird got to land man got to tell himself he understand
3,i have not read any witcher stories but season was laid out in a way i could easily follow season not so much and season is just one hot mess season episodes are composed of too many scenes that jump around making it difficult to put the pieces together to figure out how they relate to each other if they even do i plan to see the season through and hope here will be no more there are better scififantasy series that netflix production can be directed toward i feel for henry cavill having to endure inferior writing poorly cast actors and just the overall stupidity surrounding him i hope the catering is worth his day on set the only redeeming aspect of this season are costumes and prosthetics
3,im tall and small chested so the dress didnt fit me perfectly i adore the color and pattern but wish it was less revealing in the chest area i definitely have to wear something under otherwise high quality and unique dress
3,i love this fabric and the design details of this top but i am only and this top ends above my waist shoulders and sleeves fit perfectly and the neck and back details are very flattering i ended up keeping the shirt because i love the fabric so much but i am trying to find a way to wear this shirt with how short it is tucking in or wearing with highwaisted bottoms are all i can figure out for someone without a perfectly flat tummy
3,laptop works fine the biggest disadvantage is the keyboard the print on the keys is hardly visible and you need a brightly lit up room to identify the keys makes my work slower
3,only makes cookies
3,runs a size big unless you want it really boxy felt the matl was flimsy and would prob pill soon turquoise was a pretty color but returning this one
3,jenna ortegas acting is the only thing about this show thats consistently good the cinematography is occasionally striking too to be fair the plot however wasnt really that interesting in theory this sort of murder mystery plot sounds like something id like i enjoy agatha christie i enjoyed knives out and even the more lighthearted only murders in the building but wednesday just didnt do it for me somehow maybe i wasnt sufficiently invested in the characters the script made me want to pull my hair out at times every so often characters would say the most obvious words that they possibly could and exposition would be done in the laziest way possible this was strange because the show also did these things exceedingly well sometimes the show gave me a riverdale vibe except seemingly targeted at even younger audiences i suspect that i may have liked this show better if id been in my late tweens or my early teens it might be the case that im just too old to find this enjoyable
3,i always go for persil as its non bio and its cheap but it always leaves lumpy large residue behind
3,i love the quality and colors of this romper however i have a long torso and the top part was just too short for my body style it made the bottom part pull as well overall the fit just wasnt right for me i did love the material and it is a very nice piece
3,product quality is good and reasonable for the price but the display is not that great for the price and the most important thing is sound is very very very very little worst speaker you cant hear anything even when celing fan is on in your room better to connect it with some bluetooth speakers or wired speakers
3,the material was a little itchy in my opinion the fit was pretty big almost a night shirt im and i will probably only wear this around the house with tights i got a small i purchased the orange color online stay away if you have an olive skin tone its the pinkish it appears to be on be on the website im pounds d
3,the material is so soft and cozy there is just enough padding to keep me warm all year round in southern california but i ended up leaving the store without this vest bc the cut is slightly boxy every vest had different color variations you definitely should go into the store to check it out the ones i saw made the vest have cheap pattern of wide stripes not an even vintage fade as shown im so sad as everything else is perfect fits true to size
3,i was disappointed when the dress came in the mail it was much shorter on my than on the model in the picture i am the detail of the dress and fabric shown in the picture is not as prominent in person which was also disappointing the dress is just average i didnt not return the dressit looks much better on my younger sister who is the same height so i gave it to her i guess its just not the right dress for me
3,great item and very feminine can be dressed up or down and fits true to size
3,i think jenna ortega is fantastic here and completely carries the show i think that tells you the issue though without her the show isnt really that good its very ya young adult its certainly better than mostif not all ya but most of those are pretty terrible imo its not a bad show it just left me thinking this has been overhyped if you like cw shows this will be right up your street if not you might find yourself a little disappointed but then again youd miss out on a great performance by jenna ortega anyway my son and wife really enjoyed it so well be watching season hopefully jenna ortgea now being a producer means she gets more control she did after all stop the writers from doing silly things with her character in season
3,speaker quality is very low and volume ver slow
3,im hoping the show leans into the working stiffs more feels like rich people and people who feed and clean them might be better if ill give it more time to see where it goes great ensemble cast
3,i am so disappointed in the laptop it have the worst battery backup even if you just do browsing and watch videothis laptop will not last more than hrs so if you looking for a laptop that have good battery dont by this
3,super long even at and a little too voluminous for my taste incredibly comfortable and beautiful pattern though im having a hard time imagining there getting much use for me so even at the sale price theyre going back
3,i did the standard flour then egg then bread crumb breading routine and the chicken turned out nice and moist as for the bruschetta topping i found the garlic to be a bit overpowering maybe because it was mostly raw i did appreciate the fresh tomatoes and basil
3,i wanted to love this dress so much but it just looked frumpy no matter what i did im normally a and i bought a size and it still looks very baggy and not flattering im sad because in photos its my favorite dress of all time
3,its a beautiful sweater but it is very wide much wider than it looks on the model even in the xss it is also fairly itchy just way too big for my small frame which is not really the look i was going for
3,enjoying this show but i came in with high expectations because of all the positive reviews and high ratings show would be so much better without the youngest son and his wife both terrible actors and weakest part of the story john beth and rip carry the burden of the show
3,i got this shirt and loved it so much the first time i wore it it swings well and is an easy basic that looks great however after i washed it the first time it became clingy and stuck to me and doesnt lie right its such a shame because i was thrilled with this as an addition to my wardrobe
3,battery heating issue
3,i think these are amazing for anyone over say the way these hung on me at were very unflattering in the front they had an unfortunate masculine effect to them thats all i can say without being crass
3,best
3,going to alter shoulders straps by shortening for a better fit petite size would have fit better but was sold out
3,sorry toh but these were not very good i love horseradish but it does not belong in these sliders the brown sugar also does not belong with horseradish
3,mouse pad not working and it was just after week of purchase
3,the witcher is going to baffle you with its story the characters minor or major will be of importance to you it will show you the side of magic youve never seen before in tv the brutality and the shots of fight scenes are never going to be boring henry cavill anya chalotra and freya allen are all at their best every episode is interesting and youll never be bored the only problem youll face is the timelines the storyline is built in a way that it changes the timeline during the episodes without really mentioning it but figuring it out is a piece of cake and fun plus the conclusion where all the timelines meet will be satisfying you may feel frustrated with it but have patience cause the end is magnificent
3,totally worth watching it your not gonna regret it at allll
3,saw this tunic on line and when it was immediately sold out i thought it had to be a winner after several days of trolling on line the p was finally back in stock now comes the disappointment yes the material is sheer but would be a nice weight for humid summer days the front looked exactly like the model cut with high side slits that truly made this a tunic the back of this tunic is some sort of origami design the fabric bunches out at the butt area its bad when youre standing and i
3,held form well well and texture good a little too salty for my taste with saltines and salt may leave salt out next time
3,i got this off before christmas i immediately started wearing it thinking it would be a staple i like the swing shape the shape feels just right not too baggy but the material is more washed out looking than the picture reveals collects lint like crazy and out of the box the sweater looks like it has been laundered several times also there is a particularly prominent hole in the chest area as you can see in retailers picture it looks out of place in person im left loving the s
3,this jacket is cozy warm and very cute but after the st washing according to the manufacturers instructions it began to pill and has worsened each time
3,its a great show partially due to a rich source material but also because of the actors filming and production its all done just right with enough dirt blood violence sarcasm and action some minor plot sequences are questionable but the general story is tied together very well
3,i followed the recipe as it but the cake came out dense i was expecting a lighter fluffier cake the flavor of the cake was good but the texture was not what i was expecting i was expecting a lighter more spongier cake
3,was looking more for a tailored blazer like chino jacket this was just too bulky usually wear a p ordered the and could have put a chunky sweater underneath lbs c for reference
3,each episode has felt as though you are truly taken into the star wars universe the series is made by fans for fans and so has done a great job of leaving the political correctness out that ahas plagued the disney trilogy if they keep it up it will stay a fan favourite
3,i really wanted to recommend this sweater but honestly cant now i was attracted to the softness simplicity and sale price but its longevity ruined it wrinkles pills and loses shape quickly if you still want to get it consider your shoulders and how knits like this fit on you this sweater runs tts to large depending on your shoulders and bust size the styling is excellentvery versatile but the yarn is too delicate and fussy
3,a beautiful blousehowever i assumed from the photo that it had a lining it does not and the blouse is very sheer it seems to run a bit small also and if i add a camisole it might be too tight the length is adequate i may be returning it although it is very lovely and feminine
3,tried this on in store with red ag ankle jeans and the only thing i could do was chuckle it looked like a sleeveless lab coat or butchers coat take your pick this styling was not for me the fabric is nice not flimsy you can see whatever pants your wearing underneath but i guess thats a moot point since it does have a substantial side slit it does run tts im ish and the size fit ok probably would have sized up to the because a slight pull at the chest ddd in the end i
3,performance is good but screen seams to be of s very low quality display laptop is thin and light review after two day of uses
3,why cant i put some s this series deserves it actors music writers i can say thank you to absolutely everyone who had a hand in this series just give this project a chance its not boring for anyone who appreciates cinema and in modern conditions to release such a highquality project it costs a lot i will not get tired of advertising to my friends and proving how good it is of course if you are used to fanservice and solid action then this is not for you and small references and gifts for fans of old star wars wow please film projects like this at least some of the time
3,though the quality is good and the fabric is both sturdy and soft the cut of this top made this a nogo for me its a bit short in front and also boxy which is emphasized by the dolman sleeves i ordered the coral color and it was much brighter almost neony as opposed to the soft salmon color my screen shows i regretfully returned it
3,wasnt sure what this show was about but starting watching after seeing all the media buzz season one was tight great casting actors all seemed to generate ease of acting with each other rate it an a season two continues clever casting and natural interactions between the actors the season builds to a great season finale that had me on the edge of my seat rate it a season ugh some excellent actors woefully miscast with no chemistry between the characters totally boring scenario where the monkeys are the most exciting characters truly hard to sit through hopefully the next season will return to excellence rate it a d
3,i found the dot print in the store and though the pattern was cute but when i tried it on i just had to wonder who actually looks good in this style it fits like a sack big and puffy in the middle but tapered at the hem it creates the exact opposite on an hourglass shape genuinely puzzled that anyone would look good in this style to bad i hope they use these cute colors and prints on a style with some waistdefinition next time
3,just ok was rich and not the flavor i was looking for maybe as someone suggested adding some hot sauce might of giving me the flavor i was looking for
3,love the colors love the design and sure to keep you toasty im usually a size or so i ordered an extra small it felt a bit roomie
3,just like the title states it was a little slow in the firatfew episodes then it stated to get good i mean real good now most of episode and all of episode is just a pure let down how many people have to agree to these episodes before that deem it ready to release i was originally excited that disney and all of their great minds would do great things for star wars i have to take that back instead of the executives giving a thumbs up to these movies series episodes why not hire somone who actually cares about the star wars saga to preview before the release sell it back to lucus please
3,i tried this on instore because i needed a cozy cardigan but i did not buy it because i felt the quality was poor it shed all over everything i tried on with it and i left the store with little balls of sweater flufff all over my pants disappointed
3,i was so excited to get this dress and could tell right away it was beautiful the fabric and detail are perfect and seem great for summer then i tried it on to say the bust area is tight and not proportioned correctly would be putting it very nicely it was a total joke this dress is for very small chested only
3,the witcher is a fantasy drama series starring henry cavill freya allan anya chalotra joey batey myanna buring and eamon farren after seeing the entire series one thing i am sure that the potential of this series is wasted mainly due to bad and complex screenplay the series couldve been worse but is saved by the perfect star cast with almost everyone doing a fantastic show with henry cavill leading the way i would again want to give a special mention for hanry cavill in this series as he was the brightest star in the galaxy of lots of stars as mentioned earlier the screenplay is quire complex and the screenplay wasnt very much successful in distinguish between the past and present although the mystery will start unfolding as soon as the series progress and by the end of the series everything will be clear cinematography is another strong aspect of the series with some of the best vfx background music and theme is catchy and adds to the beauty my honest recommendation is that please do not go just by the negative or positive reviews as this series is different from other series if youll like you you will like it a lot or youll stop watching after or episodes personally i enjoyed it
3,average ok
3,it looks great on the model but not on me on me it looked more like a sack of potatoes the fabric is unexpected for the style in my opinion it is very thick ill be returning it because it is not flattering on me
3,good for student s
3,very heavy for a baby the use is for older over months or more but clear for that age it no longer serves the nanny and the sounds it has
3,i have been looking for a nice white top to go with many of my skirts for summer and this is not it like others its just so thin and sheer i live in the south i dont need my bra showing and i was wearing a nude bra when i tried this on and you can see everything this is fine to layer in cooler temps but now in our horrible summers where thats the last thing i wish to do the only plus i can tell you is its tts and the fabric is so comfortable and feels great on the skin however
3,something changed i came back here to get a reminder of how to make it and halfandhalf is on the recipe doubted my memory and used the half and half it was so unremarkably bland and thin heavy cream makes all the difference in the world possibly this recipe was tweaked since i saved it would rate it stars asis fine for a way to use up mushrooms but nothing i would serve for a special meal use the original heavy cream if you want starsprevious review i am trying to let the soup finish cooking but cant help stealing spoonfuls while it is on the stove i think ingredient types are key here to get the flavor right the mushrooms cant be plain white mushrooms their flavor is half the taste i used crimean but would have loved to use portabellababy bellas i also used sweet onions peruvian i cannot imagine using white or yellow with this admittedly i fudged and used a whole onion since this is going to be a base for my green bean casserole and it has plenty of onion flavor in it also at the suggestion of a friend i added a roux accidently made it very dark but the toasted flavor was perfect my chicken stock was from a rotisserie chicken and so i omitted salt and pepper simply amazing
3,so when i saw a sweater with a big llama face on the front of it i knew it must be mine i ordered it and eagerly awaited its arrival while the llama print and color of the sweater are ahmazing the fit of the sweater leaves something to be desired im a dd and mostly a size l so thats what i ordered it wasnt snug but it didnt have the cut to pull off the oversized drapey look so the areas where it was loose lookedstrange the sleeves were really long too but i could have rolle
3,it have no ips display
3,the product itself is top the sounds too the plush is soft my monthold flea loves it she falls asleep with itafter a few days of use the sound stops after a few seconds and the heartbeat stops for the price im disappointed she wasnt well studied tribute obliged to contact the brands vas its my chip that is disappointed
3,material is gorgeous and soft but the fit is another story i am a size but very small busted this suit is definitely meant for someone with a larger chest the padding was so overwhelming i also have a long torso so it just didnt really line up were the peplum should be too bad its very pretty but looked horrible
3,intel core i h is very smooth and powerful the display is also very bright and colour accuratethe battery works for hours on battery saver but if you use this while charging it can give you minor electric shocks if your house does not has proper earthing the build is really strongone major issue is that you cannot upgrade the ram but gb is more than enough for normal workthe is best in segment if you want a laptop from reputed brand but you can get intel core ultra lap read more
3,i have no experience with the game other than minutes of watching it at a friends house i really liked the way the world gets infected clever idea and it touches on logic in a way especially against an unopposed enemy the series is not a frantic and boring zombie attack but a character development series that plays with loss and emotions quite a bit id say its closer to the reality of a pandemic than a repeated attack by the living dead anyway it would be boring if there was only action and monotony the shows that did that have been gone for years maybe theyll come back when the industry gets bored and people want a lot of action with no character explanation
3,netflix or amazon tv shows are mostly horrible they change the authenticity in the name of new audience but this one regardless of the cellphone uses and the modern touches this one is actually good it has all the original ingredients from the original adams its haunting pretty sadistic savage and beautiful everything we loved the original adams for so if you are tired of these stale tv shows that are coming out these days watch this one it wont even take more than one episodes to raise your curiosity it is that good also the cast is cool acting is cool it has a distinct vibe like the hawkins town from stranger things very cool series i do hope there will be more seasonsto this
3,sound output is not gud display seems to be not for entertainment
3,this is not a show i would normally pick i was not an early adopter after visiting park city where the first few seasons are filmed we started to watch and it took a few episodes before i was hooked if you are not convinced after one episode give it some more time its worth it i promise yellowstone has the old school way of telling a story there is a hero and the antagonist is clear to the viewer for example the heroesgood guys drive dodge ram and the bad guys drive ford trucks there are plenty of these kind of examples how the production emphasizes and makes a clear line between the good and the bad
3,i was hopeful my size l would fit after another pair of leggings from antrho in this order was too small these went on easier and i was feeling good until i reached the lower abdomen and everything came to a screeching halt im not sure they are too small rather i believe they are styled to be lowrise not sure why anyone would want that in a legging but im new to this athleticwear trend regardless i wont be wearing these
3,this dress fit perfectly i think it fit just like it shows on the model i also think the color represents itself nicely in person as well i do however think that the dress is over priced for as often as you would wear this dress given that isnt a basic black and would definitely be remembered by people were you to wear it more than once i think the price is way too high a must have on sale or clearance but probably not a keeper for me full price in this color combination we will see t
3,the shape was not as nice on model seemed like a lot of extra material
3,i enjoyed some of of it but it was pretty light on the comedy side dysfunctional tragic entitled white folk with mental health issues aint so funny but there were a few good lines but i wouldnt go so far as to say its a comedy
3,it breaks my heart to say this but i had to return for shape issues i am not a fan of dolman sleeves they make me look big and bulky and i wished i would have known that prior to purchasing it is unfortunate because it is a really beautiful knit and quality i could see this working better on someone tall and thin
3,excellent script plot making style the setting acting cinematography casting placing of actors intensity of action sequences efforts to keep audience glued throughout the seasons what a delight to watch the machismo cilian bold helen and natasha intriguing tom a helpless kate thw obedient finn and joe and stubborn and raging paul throughout the seasons it is also strangley intriguing to learn how shady and dullish were the politicians and the bureaucracy were back then and sam indeed stirred up my rage towards his character and i am sure that the climax is going to be beyond ones wildest imagination
3,battery back is not good only hours and heating issue
3,this show has one incredibly annoying and frustrating issue i realize its probably just the directors style but the long dramatic pauses are driving me crazy some times the pause fits well sometimes is pointless for instance when someone asks a question especially with the handmaids they just stare blankly for seconds before mumbling a couple words or when they are supposed to be in a hurry to get away the character always takes their time saying goodbye or again staring blankly at something or when they are told to do something it takes them like seconds to start moving i like that the show does more showing without words than telling but at the same time these characters should be acting like there is a much bigger sense of urgency than they do
3,i really wanted to love this dress i absolutely love the fabric and the bottom of it sadly the top was just too balloon like and poofed out way too much i tried putting a belt with it which helped a little bit if the top had been just a little more fitted this would be awesome i dont know if a smaller size would have helped the issue i ordered a small and considered an xs but in the end just returned it
3,those who cannot see the clear and direct parallels between this wellexecuted drama and the direction america is being driven are simply delusional the flashbacks show the slowmotion creep of authoritarianism cloaked in theocracy and how americans reacted with deercaughtinheadlights reflexivity until it was too late its a stunning sobering hard stare into the dystopian nearfuture unless americans stand up united and defend the constitution of this country against those who seek to subvert it
3,i had never heard of the video game on which the last of us is based so i watched the series with an unbiased view what a show there have been many productions over the years depicting people trying to survive in a postapocalyptic world but this one ups the ante with the types of characters that it has and the suspense that it creates on every episode now nominated for several emmys and with a second season in production the last of us is one of the many outstanding series that weve seen in the st century this is what happens when the writers have the power instead of the executives definitely see it the writers guild is currently on strike for a reason
3,i tried this jacket on and it was definitely cute but a couple things to note its a wool acrylic blend and it was already starting to pill from being tried on in the store also its unlined i thought the price point was high given its fibers and unlined given its hem i wonder how much longevity the piece has and how quickly it might start to look dated too
3,not good for for an hourglass shape lots and lots of pretty fabric but the waist hits just where the hips widenvery bohemian just no good for a figure the sizing is generous with both elastic and a zipper theres room to go small if between sizes be aware the plunge at the front is wide and dramatic i dropped the hangar in the dressing room and had to clutch fabric close to my reasonablymodest ccup so as not to spill out would perhaps work on a very narrow person whos completel
3,super cute sweater and i was totally excited and then i looked at the sleeves which are not shown in the pictures what you can not see are the dragonfly sequins and sparkly beads suitable for women and ugh too bad going right back
3,ive had the item months ive always had minor problems it just recently started freezing and rebooting my devices gss currently s sandisk is sending me a new one
3,wish id noticed that the sleeve cuff and hem were cut to look hippiecasual im taking this back with great regret its soft and the prettiest pale limesherbet color made for a cool summer look i dont like tattered though so back it goes sigh its soft true fit and beautiful id buy it in many colors and in the lovely lavender print if it wasnt for the cuts
3,product more not durable
3,backlit key not visible clearly
3,okay okay
3,there was absolutely no character that interest me at all went to get up a snack and when i came back i almost changed the channel but i wanted to give at least the first three episodes a chance diego luna as the acting chops of a rock the star wars universe has such interesting fun and funky characters from the animals the androids the humans to the animated the free makers family is my favorite pedro pascal under the mandalorian mask with his little green baby have more personality in one scene than any of the characters in the first three episodes this the show reminds me of the latest batman with the super boring actor robertson is this the future of movies bleak grungy dirty nonshaved young actors who dont seem to care about anything and dont seem to do anything in their roles
3,after eyeing this product online for awhile i was able to try it on in store im so glad i did because while this dress is lovely it is clearly not designed for my body type i have a small rib cage and a large bust h which is i think what caused the keyhole to be so gaping on me additionally the straps of the dress were up by my neckline instead of lying properly on my shoulders which was unflattering and left my bra straps clearly visible the fabric was gorgeous and soft and the
3,tooooo much of heating not value for money
3,i purchased this shirt in a medium in the wine color i love the drape and fit of the shirt it has a laid back vibe and the material is supper soft and comfy it is also a bit more substantial than some of the thinner shirts ive bought at retailer you could easily dress this up or down i wore this shirt a couple times and then machine washed it on cold on a delicates cycle and dried it flat it majorly shrunk now i cant wear it because the length shrank at least an inch or more if you purc
3,i wanted to give this a glowing review but i ended up returning this cardigen the folds on top added too much to my frame i do not suggest this for heavier apple shapes for all others it is incredibly soft and warm the tan color was weird but they others are simply gorgeous
3,i have played games and read books and i know this doesnt follow games but books and they did pretty good by looking what they had us to offer they only had like eight episodes and they had to show journey of so many important characters in this little amount of time and as far as i can see they did pretty well i heard some people complaining about some changes in show from books and i can see that too but the thing is they had to do that changes to introduce important characters like i said if they did stuck to books then we havent had seen characters like yen more often and for people who dont know books or games could have cared about them that much so they had to introduce characters like yen very early and more often in show so that peoplewho dont know books or games bond with their character and dont treat them as side characters as we know that they arent its just books are written in geralts perspective so we can only know what geralt knows in books but when you make show you have to consider others perspectives as well and i think they did very good job of that and about changes from book i think every show or movies based on books has changes no matter its game of thrones or lort or harry potter everyone has to change something to make a show work according to their vision reading a book is other thing and watching a show is other so i expected that and its there i dont have much issue with that so overall i loved the show and im hoping that netflix really invest big in it and give show runners more seasons prior to next season so that they can give a time to their stories and can make better plans for future so that they dont have to rush in every season in fear of it being last one hope netflix catches it and give them more episodes per season or more seasons prior to next season i hope everyone enjoys it
3,i am and i typically wear a or a p lately ive been finding that petite is just a little too short to wear with wedges so i often order a as i did in this dress it fits well and its flattering my two complaints are that it gets wrinkly fast and looks sloppy yes linen is a wrinkly look and thats normal for linen but somehow this dress just looks sloppy to me more importantly while wearing for the first time i realized that the seams on the side were very lightly sewn and there
3,this is a beautiful piece but the cut is not flattering i ordered my usual small and while the top fit the fringed part was huge kind of maternity i can only imagine there was some clothespinning going on for the photo this would have been great if it had about inches of fabric removed from the lower part obviously it cannot be altered so sad must return
3,although the design and quality were great this did not work for me it was boxy square and overwhelmed my petite frame if you are taller or have a longer torso this may be a great basic staple for your wardrobe
3,actually really enjoyed this as a standalone show i watched this with my nine year old daughter whom also really loved it completely binged it and thoroughly enjoyed the suspense of it all i likened it to the tv series legacies lots of non human species murder mystery suspense and teen drama as for a spinoff of the addams family it isnt really kooky or have the overly morbid humour like the original the addams family was a bit of a letdown with that side of this tv series overall i actually rate this show and really looking forward to what the next seasons bring to the table
3,this is one of those dresses that might be better for those under on me the fullness of the pleats and the bell sleeve made me feel like i was wearing one of those dresses for a much older lady i miss not having to consider those things the red color is lovely and the dress is modest i just think it will read a lot better on a younger chiquita
3,its good product with budget but battery backup problem issue is most priority
3,i guess i am in a comfort clothing mood these days since i have been looking at a lot of them lately this one is a nice thicker material and i like that the sleeves go all the way down but i am not a fan of the design i felt the color scheme was very plain the neckline comes up higher on me than i would have expected and makes me feel like i am choking it is not a flattering cut on me and does not accentuate anything i would want it to nor does it hide imperfections it truly is comfort we
3,i worked days on this show absolutely the best crew and amazing actors i only got to see what i saw during shoot then saw the final product amazing but im glad hbo but this out with velma to save hbos credibility when you put that out then to put this out yes a little bias bro g part of it where as wasnt on velma but wow love the slight difference to the game yet keep the story right on par not coming back to alberta but love to see it and the work done behind the scenes from locals to make this bigger the got good work alberta good work actra for the work force provided and even though im sure wont return to the cold north it was a life blessing to stand beside all the people that made this first season amazing
3,i made this and while it was very tasty i didnt care for the pretzel crust i will make this again but will use a graham cracker crust
3,this is definitely a personal preference review i loved this dress when i tried it on its really beautiful however there was just way too much fabric on the sleeves for me i know its the style and i have similar style dresses but i felt really large in this dress and it all came down to the sleeves for me
3,the show is fast paced and the action scenes are really well choreographed the the plot does not lag behind and is well narrated
3,so this is still a pretty cute shirt but my xs is missing the ruffle in the front and has layers on the bottom front of shirt it doesnt seem to be defective just a different version of the shirt im curious to find out from others if they have gotten the same shirt as i have still deciding whether to keep or not no more left in xs to place another order and see whats up i do wish it had the ruffle in front as that is what caught my eye
3,product is good according to me in the following aspects design battery worth for money portability performance it is attractive as well in terms of its aesthetic its best suitable for students who attend online classes however its not compatible to take online classes and android applications are not working as affectively as they are in an android phone for everything we need internet connection
3,i bought this shirt in white and am happy with the fact that its not too sheer the back detail is great my only complaint is that it is too long i got the small and it fits nicely in the arms and top but it is much longer on me than on the model im tall it doesnt look great when i do a half tuck but it looks fine if i tuck it all the way in maybe an xs would have been a better fit
3,while the styling is cute the fit was poor under the arms and there was quite a gap i returned this
3,not impressed meshy and salty from that amount of bacon
3,wish this worked for me i am it is much shorter than it looks in the photo and the pockets did not hit my hips or torso in the right spot the neck was kind of tight on me too i love the idea of this dress but need it longer the dress is very roomy overall
3,i have mixed feelings about this ive read all the books and seen the movies with tom cruise tom cruise was too small thats about all i have to say about him and his part as for alan ritchson he has the look maybe a bit too muscular his walk and posture however i dont consider very military he doesnt walk up straight and takes small steps like he has a stick up his bottom the expressions on his face and the way he talks are more like hes imitating the good doctor than how i imagined jack reacher i wouldve preferred to see a more manly walk and talk
3,i bought three of these tees i kept the turquoise one only though the color was pretty a little drab but not too bad i love the style the fabric is so soft and the one i wore was super comfy the sleeves are cute without being too dramatic like the ruffle sleeve tee the sleeves were kind of ridiculous on me now the cons the colors are pretty drab i normally look better in more vibrant colors the red i bought made me look like a corpse its not pretty at all cant re
3,im amazed people give less than an i mean the cineamtics is great the atmosphere is awesome and we are talking about cavill this series makes me wanna buy a hooded cape and get into the wilderness and kill beasts and all and im a girl
3,uncertain about sizing i got both the the both made me look like a noasser neither fit quite right in the leg both hit at a weird point in my calf not cuteshort just off im and to quote my husband nope not feeling these that said they feel great on seem to be made well but are heading back to an retailer near you sigh the quest continues
3,very cute top and nice material but the fit is strange theres a reason that the model has her arms at her side the shoulders fit perfectly in my usual small but the body is very loose the sleeves are full probably twice as full as seen in the pictureswhich adds interest but was unexpected also the arm hole is wide so the bottom seam of the sleeve attaches low on the body of the shirt which creates an awkward silhouette i normally love designs by whit but im not sure about this one
3,just started watching the series each episode keeps you tense i have russian background and i can totally feel through this film what it was like when communists came to power or how hitler was suppressing jews i could only imaging it but the way this series is filmed i can totally feel what its like when your freedom and your life is taken away from you
3,i bought this top online in the stripesivory lace fits great and is beautiful quality i usually wear smallsize in tops and the small was perfect however i found that the ivory lace detail on the bottom sides gave me a saddlebag effect not good sadly its going back
3,after week use according to body keyboard is small so trackpad is very large so if you wear watch or anything in your hand you will not be able to type properlyz display is perfect performance is good battery is ok
3,i rarely ever rate anything a but this show deserves it i dont get why all the complaintsa lot of scifi tv shows take a while to take a turn and in season and you see that happening its a matter of understanding where the story is going the suspense of it all is what makes the show so greatif youre impatient and do not have an imagination then do not watch i personally fell in love with the show since season and i have yet to be disappointed i hope there are more seasons to come
3,battery drain quickly
3,i bought the grey t with the design around the yoke its cute but the fabric is a little on the thin side kind of cheap im glad i didnt pay full price for it runs true to size
3,this dress was very cute the first time i wore it but after my second wear the bottom layer didnt remain adjacent to the top layer and i found it to be awkward
3,i wanted to wear this for my journey to cuncun and i wanted the blight pink as photo however it was a dark pink which didnt fit to me unfortunately but the design was pretty
3,i had such high hopes for this dress and really wanted it to work for me i initially ordered the petite small my usual size but i found this to be outrageously small so small in fact that i could not zip it up i reordered it in petite medium which was just ok overall the top half was comfortable and fit nicely but the bottom half had a very tight under layer and several somewhat cheap net over layers imo a major design flaw was the net over layer sewn directly into the zipper it c
3,some series seem to lose their way in the third installment but not reacher season three continues to be fresh with great acting dialogue appropriate for the genre scenery and a light sprinkle of comic relief never a dull moment reacher takes you on a wild ride with twists and turns with lots of surprises along the way although i have not read the book i am told that reacher is true to form no wonder it has been renewed for another season i cant wait if the past is prelude to the future we can all expect another installment that will deliver the same energy that we have come to expect and love about the series
3,the shirt was cute im very petite and it ran very wide so didnt fit me well
3,i have to say that this show has a surprisingly great acting from the support cast every character feels unique and youll definitively remember them in most tv shows youll have a main character with good acting but with a horrible freaking side cast that makes things unbearable to watch this series tells story thats great but most importantly feels unique which is why i felt so hooked up on it it takes place in a early century post first world war with a story revolving around ex soldiers who tries by any means to climb up the socioeconomical hierarchy
3,way to v necked other than that would be a nice go to top needs a cami
3,some super hero movies are more realistic than this show this reacher guy is somewhat of unstoppable and somehow knows everything its not really a thriller because there is no suspense its not really a mystery because its al very obvious the writing is poor but all and all its watchable for some reason but its no way near as good as some of the thriller and actionshow these days
3,very good taste and easy to make however it wasnt quite the consistency it should have been for potato soup even though i added extra flour when i reheated it the potatoes turned mushy
3,after george lucas sold star wars to disney the space adventure saga lost its identity as this epic largerthanlife space opera rooted in mythology and imagination star wars must follow certain rules established by george lucas its the camera the music the sets the costumes the actors the style of the dialogues the aliens creatures etc everything within star wars is very structured so that when you look at the screen you immediately know that you are in a galaxy far far away that this is star wars and no other film andor looks and feels like its set in a completely different universe or that its some kind of weird dystopian scifi set on planet earth where the characters salvaged whatever old weapons and uniforms they could find everything in andor looks off the aesthetics and the style of star wars are gone the imagination is gone even when you put away the fact that the elements of star wars are not there and its just a brand name stamped onto some medievallooking tv show its too boring to watch there is no story to follow the conversations are dull and empty we are stuck with watching the empire vs the rebels narrative forever there is nothing new and exciting at disney they dont understand star wars george lucas created an exciting space fantasy adventure filled with exotic planets and strange exotic creatures and aliens and infused it with so many mythological spiritual psychological political themes and he worked very hard to always make it new without him star wars is gone no imagination no creativity and the lack of understanding of the building blocks of star wars is the main reason why we are getting this kind of content from disney and it hurts especially if you are a star wars fan who truly understood george lucass vision
3,witcher is doing a good job filling the void left by got the twist in the story is quite well written with so much suspense laid into each episode if fantasy magical and sensational is your pick witcher sure have its charms set to sway you
3,i really wanted to love this shirt it looked so nice and cool for summer and i dont own anything purple the color was really nice very subtly feminine i am a little too short for this style though i am ft inch lbs ordered an xxs and it was still too wide the side slits came up a little too high for my liking but i easily couldve stitched those up a bit and theyd have been fine i think this would look great on taller women but on me it looked like a dumpy sack
3,i liked the idea of this tshirt dress for a great basic wardrobe staple however i feel that it was overpriced for the quality its a nice piece but i would wait for it to go on sale
3,im usually a petite but bought in regular xs perhaps a petite would have worked better but this was way too low cut in front and back i did not like the way it hung on me at all im and lbs but regular xs normally fits better than this did i could barely keep the shoulders from slipping off sorry its a return for me
3,originally bought the plaid version and retuned it to order this one in the store to get free shipping the fit is completely different i am a consistent small particularly in dresses of this style will be exchanging this for a medium which i hope will fit love the color and pattern
3,this dress is beautiful as pictured on the model but on me not so much i am normally a size with a b bra size i ordered this dress in an xs and it was just too big and boxy i also thought the material was going to be thicker but it was very thin and didnt seem to fall right on my body beautiful design just not the right material or fit
3,let me start by saying that i cannot wear wool it doesnt matter what type it is or if it is combined with cashmere it makes me itch so much that i just cant do it and i didnt not find this as itchy as others stated that being said you definitely need to size down i am a standard small and purchased the xs and there is still a load of fabric i still dont know what to think i think it is okay but i am not sure it justifies the price point
3,performance battery
3,i liked this top but found it to be a little dowdy fit was slightly boxy and not a good look for me may look better on a different body type
3,id rate it a overall season drew me in because i had no idea what to expect and i really enjoyed the storyline one big advantage of this series is its wellknown cast however season felt like a copy of season with no major changes or different circumstances honestly i was so bored at times that i watched some episodes at x speed season though pulled me back in with a very interesting plot and the return of some characters from previous seasons so far five episodes have aired and its getting really good i highly recommend watching the white lotus if you want something entertaining that doesnt require deep thinking just sit back relax and enjoy
3,scale of ease of prep super easy just toss in a bowl and mixcooking time its about average for breadstexture still a little fluffier than i like but the crust isnt as flakymoisture has enough that i didnt feel like a slice needed some kind of spreadflavor sweeter than i like less sugar next time
3,i like the fabric very smooth and feels nice on the skin i like the handkerchief hemline tooi didnt realize how much i would not like the neckline it feels too tight and too high to me and im not sure i could wear this for long without pulling at the neck also the fit is loose maybe a bit too loose for my taste but its the neck fit that makes me have to return this dress
3,this is a pretty dress although it runs smaller and the colors arent as vibrant as on the website the waist ran very small for me in a size which is my normal size and normally runs looser in the waist area as i have an hour glass figure this probably will look very nice on someone smaller
3,i loved how this jacket looked online and decided to order it however sizing can sometimes be tricky for me so i ordered both a petite xs and petite xxs im lb and a bra size c i tired on the xxs first and was swimming in it so naturally i thought the xs would be even bigger but to my surprise the xs fit way more snug in the end i still didnt like how loose the xs fit so i returned them both the material is great quality and its a cute design i would recommend trying t
3,this top is beautiful however it runs beyond big i ordered my usual size and i could have fit of me in this top i am reordering and going sizes down the tie back and embroidery is beautiful
3,its almost impossible to believe that this tv show has gotten good reviews its so extraordinarily flat each scene takes three times as long as it should as the camera lingers forever on flowers clouds and the ocean the music at first charming becomes weirdly monotonous all the characters are terrible people the kind of people who you suspect are actually very boring and yes it turns out they are indeed very boring but you still have to watch hour after hour of them being boring you have to listen to hour after hour of the monotonous music you have to watch the camera artily longer over every goddamn flower in the entire island and on top of all that you also have to watch jennifer coolidge give the only bad performance of her entire life all in all an almost unwatchable television event
3,i really couldnt tell if i like the dress or not it was swimming on me and i always wear a size small design is great with cross straps in the back thin silky fabric i would call the color more of a bright coralorange not a bright redill get back if i decide to try ordering the xs
3,for reference im lbs with a short torso so i was thrilled when i saw this jacket online i was expecting a soft comfortable and polished piece i tried on a standard size xs and the color of the khaki is muted on line its a little darker in person and the finishings like zipper plackets are much lighter in contrast also it is a mixedmediamaterial type for example its linen with soft leather accents which also have varying tones on the inside of the collar on the wrist area
3,this is an average top i thought it would be a good work shirt my office is very causal but it was just too loungey looking fit is true to size the fabric is thin a little see through not worth in my opinion i returned it
3,in the photo this sweater is very appealing but in person very disappointing i am always take a size medium but on me the sleeves were far too long and the sweater just didnt fit properly the collar doesnt fold right in the front and it hangs awkwardly if you try to use the button it stretches and looks terrible in the back it falls short its going back
3,really easy to make i added mushrooms to mine and i used soy ground beef vegetarian and it turned out well nothing too exciting but easy and cheap cant go wrong there
3,dont be a fool with gen processor if you want to play games or edit video then definitely this one is not for you gb version is better
3,i liked the quality of the top and the design but when i got a top that fit well across the chest it was shorter than i usually like my tops so i will be returning it
3,the quality of this shirt is great and the colors are pretty it just made me look super wide i feel like the waist is too high not quite empire and not quite at the waist it just wasnt going to work for my body maybe a different size would work but i dont like it enough to try
3,finally something great about new sw mandalorian is better than all new sw moviesgreat storygreat visual effectsabsolutely great lets not forget baby yoda who stole the whole show he is so adorable and cute love this showcant wait for the new episodesthis is the way i have spoken
3,sound dont like
3,i am ever in search of a light white summer top this is not quite it there are two distinct layers and each of them is the scratchy starchy type of gauze it would just roast me in the summer sunbut i run fairly hot in general
3,ridiculous series with ridiculous characters with some exceptions never in my life would i imagine seeing a scene like that in the last episode in a while well have few things to see
3,ive made a similar recipe before and it called for pans not using it took almost minutes longer to bake than recipe time i used aluminum pans also ingredients were missing from main list and only mentioned in video other than that its tasty and still moist with extra baking time i did like folding in chopped berries to cake instead of using mixer
3,the colors are beautiful and the fabric is very soft and comfortable i will be returning because of issues with length and being low cut for reference i am lbs ddd the dress was low cut and showed too much cleavage for my comfort but this may not be an issue for women with smaller breasts or if you dont mind some cleavage showing this length was also a bit too long so if you are or shorter you may want to order the petite size
3,only bite os support
3,overall soft material cute pattern but definitely a return as just didnt fit right fit i am a six in most tops and based on the size chart i ordered the size small it fit comfortably around my bust but the cup placement was basically at the center of my chest so that my breasts were squished uncomfortably and unflattering in the middle ive lost a bit of weight recently so im more of a a than b these days but this wouldnt work for me or i imagine anyone with a broad
3,i received this skirt today and was very disappointed i dont know what i expected but it is not as i thought even though the quality is very good and the fit is true to size i may return it the fabric of the skirt is just too busy at least for me i am just uncertain and even though i have many tops the colors are just not matching white looks better than any colored top with this particular print i am going to try it on one more time and make a definite decision
3,i loved the materials texture and drape but it was too sheer for me i am against having to wear a tank under white tees which means i have a lot of trouble finding any white tees but other than the seethrough nature i loved this shirt
3,too heavy for a laptop keyboard is average quality and speakers sound is too low only good thing is i and gb ram at this price
3,i thought this was so cute online sweet and feminine but when it arrived and i tried it on in my usual p i felt like i had just stepped back into freshman year of highschool it is very early s not the bohemian i was going for it is also very high waisted even for my little frame i truly felt like they pulled this out of someones closet dusted it off and said ta da as much as i love rachel and monica i have moved on from their clothing
3,as a longtime reader of fantasy but unfamiliar with this series or the video game i enjoy this series but find it so confusing trying to follow the timelines i love geralts character and the cinematography and battle scenes however i thought by episode it would have pulled things together a bit more i keep wracking my brain trying to figure how it all relates and when the various scenes actually take place utterly confusing the books will be on my list to read in the near future but for the uninitiated the netflix series is gorgeous to look at but ultimately unsatisfying hoping the remaining episodes get better
3,slouchy relaxed fit well sewn together and hangs well on the body bottom hem hits upper thigh good length and soft easy fabric light layering option as well good spring jacket can be kept on indoors without getting too hot
3,i ordered this in a frustration free for i dont really know why and to my surprise the package was already openamazon is trying to make my life so much easier that i wont even need to open anything anymore ironymaybe someone messed with my card maybe not but im never ordering anything in frustration free packageill test the card and update the reviewupdateafter testing the card and contacting sandisk about it im able to confirm that the card is authenticthe star review reflect the packaging i might not use it next time
3,season is an improvement in almost every way the special effects and overall cinematography has been improved as well the set design hopefully it wont be as long of a wait for season
3,this feels nice and soft my son didnt like the music or the weight he likes our dogs ikea lion better i ended up taking the battery pack out this is a very expensive night light that i had to take out of my sons crib because he was stepping on the otter to lean over ive removed the pack and he plays with as a stuffed animal
3,i love belted sweaters but this was way too low in front it hung almost to my knees in front im not a fan of that look
3,this sweater is huge i usually wear a small ordered an extra small and i was still swimming in it i like big sweaters but i ended up returning it because the sizing looked ridiculous
3,the touch pad of the laptop is not perfect
3,i wait for days each year for the next book from lee and now from him and his brother and i read it within a few hours and wait another days of course in the meantime i read it another or times i do like tom cruise so i had no problem him as jack in the films but they did pick probably the two worst books to make movies from so i was eagerly waiting a true to the size reacher and to know which book would be the subject of the first season i was very happy with both primarily because starting with book one is a good omen for seasons to come the only change really from the books is that its current day and not set in the late s but aside from that the violence we love reacher for is there and the only thing missing for me is the st person narration i think in the shows he could have narrated his thoughts eg in the diner at the start of episode he looks at the other diners when the cops show up but in the books he narrates how each of the diners cannot be the intended arrestee and it must be him a very minor point cos all told this is a great adaptation roll on season
3,heating issue with fan problem
3,it was just okay
3,i love the look of this dress but the length feels a little awkward which might be my height im thinking about having it altered not sure if i will do that or return it i love the colors and the back cut out it may be a better length for taller individuals
3,cute print on both sides but far more cheek was exposed than i anticipated from the photos the front isnt too skimpy but the back is a bit too small for my taste definitely narrower in the back than a standard bikini cut too bad the matching top is my favorite top so i guess ill just have to wear black bottoms with it
3,didnt turn out well if i ever make these again i will omit the water in the meatballs cause they fell apart i will also omit the sugar a little too sweet
3,this is okbut my mamaw would never use a mix
3,i just finished four seasons of yellowstone now looking forward to the fifth good actors stars good acting beautiful scenery and unseen footage of the cowboys life and work otherwise pointless dialog and it gave me the impression that when they want to kick the actors out or want to quit a butchered episode is contrived you wonder who is left on the team without a remotely truthful script i mean when the main cowboy gets in the mood he can kill anyone anywhere in any number he wants the wild west of today i understand kevin costner is both producer and star he could have spent the money on more elaborate episodes they are saved by nature horses bulls and buffalo and rodeos
3,i tried this blouse on in the store and chose not to purchase it i did not think the fabric or design warranted the price point as it felt a bit cheap and theres not much to the design it is true to size my usual size fit well enough im on the tall side with an average bust and i did not find it short my friend was shopping with me and she thought it looked maternity on her as she is thin but very well endowed she also thought it made her shoulders look broad personally i liked it on
3,a lot of people came with the idea of a replacement for got and other group came with the idea of the game but none of them will be satisfied because this is a totally different show and i love it it has his own style and its ow way to show you the characters as you will forward in the chapters you will be getting close and care for each of them
3,soft cozy and cute but pilled badly after st wearing and now will be relegated to wearing at home only for this reason i cannot recommend felt like i wasted my money i purchased the xs petite im lbs and i could have gone down to xxs but i was ok with it being looser
3,beautiful but big i exchanged my for a and oddly enough there was no difference had a similar experience with another blouse am i crazy or is the size just a sham
3,i have been searching high and low for some good quality jeans sadly i dont think these are it i love the design and style of these jeans great length great cut great color unfortunately in the weeks that i have had them they are balling and looking like ive had them for years im so disappointed and will have to continue on my search apparently they dont make jeans like they used too
3,the product is ok like fans makes lot of sound and one thing for gamers that the tgp of the gpu is watt and works ingame in ww so carefully choose your device
3,quite frankly the show is worth simply for every line of comedy gold uttered by dandelion regardless of the great stuntwork character building story and intrigue
3,backlit keyboard was mentioned in the gb ram variant but no backlit given in the laptop
3,well everyone is so like hateful this days that hating rather than appreciating something has become easier dont know why thats easier than anything well the series aint that bad at all i feel there is so much content from the books games etc that finding a middle ground for the series is freaky but for crying out its great i need more and more
3,the wonderful dialogues that were contained in the book are simply childish in this series the creators completely did not use the potential of the psychopathic character of rience this character had great potential for the entire third season it could be presented as well as ramsays character in got mrs lauren completely does not understand either sapkowskis books or the game from cd project red there are no political games that were thoroughly described in the book that gave the whole story meaning no sense of map geography of the world the producer of the series does not respect the lore of this book in fact she is rewriting it except that it is so senseless and incomprehensible that it is not surprising that henry cavill a huge fan of books and games simply resigned from this role this is simply not watchable
3,this dress is very cute on very flouncy i know it looks like a gingham dress but its a more like a silk dress with a gingham pattern the one issue i had was that it ballooned out at the back where you tied it on any size bug or small and i am larger on top so i dont know what would happen with someone with a small chest i wouldnt have minded if it did the same thing on the front but it was just the back
3,this is a very lightweight comfy sweater jacket i wanted to love but didnt find it special enough for the price i am usually between a small and medium and tried on both sizes in the gray and the navy the small fit snug in the shoulder but i liked how the layering showed at the bottom of the front that look was lost on the medium though the general fit was better in the end the looked medium too sloppy for my taste and the small felt too small
3,i have a recipe i love and thought i would give this one a try my old favorite is much better
3,the dress arrived with two large buttons missing from the front complete with unraveling threads the rest of the buttons are sewn on loosely and in general its poor quality ridiculous considering the price very disappointed
3,does its job and fairly cheap for what its worth i had to return my first one and exchange it for another because the first one was defective sandisk really needs to do better quality assurance on their products the second one works perfectly fine i use it for my gopro camera
3,this is a beautiful beaded shirt the quality seems good i just didnt like the shoulders they are pleated and puffy the picture doesnt really show them very well also the collar is a little floppy i was hoping it would have an option to stand up but that is not the case the beading is well done and looks to be stable i just thought it ran a little large and the shoulders looked puffy i returned it
3,i ran to the store to try to this on after seeing it online im usually between a small and medium on tops depending on the shirt the fit true to size everything about this shirt fit perfectly and it is beautifully designed but it is just soooo sheer i had a nude bra on and you could see every detail of it through both the front and back i couldnt wear this comfortably without a cami disappointing as i had the highest hopes for finding a crisp white shirt for the summer
3,i was so excited about this recipe but my husband and i felt there was something missing we will try it again as a base but play around with the seasoning we thought the sour cream made it seem like stroganoff soup so well leave that out next time
3,screen size is inches not low audio
3,one wash wonderim a s to m and went with a m but could have gone with a s with ease after washing it was way shorter it shrunk more than a whole size in cold water i assumed everything came preshrunk but sadly disappointed great for one wear
3,i wanted to love this dress so much but unfortunately it fell a little short of my expectations the overall quality of the dress is great its very light flowy and super comfortable to wear i just wish it was a bit more flattering i debated on returning it since it didnt really give me any shape but the material was so darn comfortable and such an easy outfit to thrown on that i couldnt part with it
3,not best but its ok ok
3,this series is amazing a must bingewatch from netflix who did a really good job when you reach the final episode you just want more sadly the next season is set to be ready in so im sitting here and waiting already i never read the books nor played the games but you really dont have to the universe will draw you in and the characters are amazing the storyline might confuse you a bit but relax take a pause if needed and reflect why the timeline is how it is you will enjoy the series more if you figure this out early good job netflix and crew of this series
3,cooking pound of bacon and a medium onion together does not work onion burns before the bacon is crisp on medium heat do them separately or start the bacon well before adding the onion
3,good for normal use
3,perfect gaming laptop if you get it under k
3,i really wanted to love this top when i got it but not so much it fit nicely through the bust and torso but flared out way too much it ended up looking like a maternity top maybe because i am more of an hourglass shape another thing it was very low cut i would not have been able to wear this without a cami underneath the fabric didnt seem to be the best quality it also had a funny smell too it when i took it out of the package this shirt was not worth the price sadly this was a mis
3,i love the style of this top hand washed before wearing and it looks like a rag before i even got to wear it very disappointed since i thought it would be a very practical tank
3,experience okay normal task heavy task not a good
3,love the blue color and the bit of sparkle gives this otherwise casual piece a bit of flair the hem is cool love the big cuffs but i looked like the liberty bell in the small it is huge through the hips not at all like on th model i also worried it would shrink and i would lose the length in the arms returned
3,good for one handed use
3,i loved this top in the blue and wanted so badly for it to fit however it was very unflattering on my frame the bottom hemline is straight across all around whereas i thought it was longer in the back i could see this looking great on a really petite frame runs large xs fit however wasnt flattering
3,we bought it for our monthold baby who has a hard time falling asleep and we only get him to do it on the chest in bed and the truth is that he has not listened to it nor does it happen to sleep nor to play it strikes him zero the toy itself meets all the features it announces it is adorable warm and soft but in our case it does not fulfill its purpose of relaxing and sleeping the baby
3,the last of us is a masterful television adaptation of the beloved video game that delivers a gripping and deeply emotional experience the series follows joel a hardened survivor navigating a brutal postapocalyptic world ravaged by a fungal infection and ellie a resilient young girl who may be humanitys last hope together their journey explores themes of survival trust and the complex bonds that form in desperate times the acting throughout the series is exceptional pedro pascal brings a raw intensity and vulnerability to joel perfectly capturing the characters gruff exterior and hidden depth bella ramseys portrayal of ellie is equally impressive embodying a mix of toughness curiosity and emotional complexity that makes her character truly memorable the chemistry between the two leads is electric and forms the emotional core of the show grounding the larger story in their relationship visually the last of us is stunning painting a postapocalyptic landscape that is both haunting and beautiful the cinematography captures the stark contrasts between desolation and fleeting moments of hope while the special effects and production design create a world that feels immersive and believable every frame reflects the care and detail invested in bringing this world to life while the series does take some creative liberties with the source material it does so thoughtfully the changes made are designed to deepen character development and enhance the narrative rather than merely replicate the games storyline this fresh perspective allows the show to stand on its own merits appealing to longtime fans and newcomers alike ultimately the last of us is a mustwatch television series that brilliantly balances tension emotion and storytelling it captures the heart and spirit of the original game while elevating the material through powerful performances and cinematic craftsmanship whether youre familiar with the game or discovering this story for the first time the series offers a compelling and unforgettable journey
3,the dress is beautiful i wanted to like it and could hardly wait to reveive it it fits beautifully and snug except around the arms where it is huge i could only wear it with a tshirt underneat
3,the regular length i tried on in store definitely didnt work for me for reference in the photos i have a medium on and my measurements are
3,i really wanted this to work alas it had a strange fit for me the straps would not stay up and it had a weird fit under the breast it worked standing up but the minute i sat down it fell off my shoulders the fabric was beautiful and i loved that it had pockets
3,just watched whole episodes storyline and character was awesome nice vfx work could have been more but this enough for witcher game series fans eagerly waiting for season
3,ive binge watched all the first season episodes and i can honestly say this is a fantasy world which works well right from the get go the use of magic and monsters is revealed so there is no slow drawn out reveal as there was say with game of thrones geralt is an excellent antihero as is yennefer i would say the mood and style of this series is somewhere in between the shannara chronicles and game of thrones but do not mistake this to mean that it is of the same quality as the shannara chronicles the shannara chronicles was a pretty rubbish series and got a well deserved cancelled season the young actors were just not up to it the witcher has great acting right across the board and special fx are up there highly recommended to fans of the fantasy genre do not believe the mainstream media reviews which are giving it stars this is a sold stars to stars tv series
3,i liked both jack reacher movies with tom cruise and didnt know what to expect from this one i just have to say that if alan ritchson would have played jr in the two movies i would have liked them even more he has such presence and he looks both scary and handsome at the same time have seen episodes so far but really loving this one hopefully the other episodes will be as good and a season becomes reality
3,was having to grab a stool and stand on tiptoes to reachup his height and physique is nothing like the books unlike this tv outing whats more this reacher is believable in his imposing and intimidating sense just as the books implied fantastic job of bringing life to the books and stories that many have come to love works incredibly well as an episodic tv series too acting is great for tv and the fight scenes are brutal absolutely loving this and wishing it was a much longer series eagerly awaiting more
3,cillian murphy and helen mccrory rip are simply spectacular and tom hardy unrecognizable almost steals the show in the few episodes he appears in the rest of the cast is more than adequate especially adrian body who play an america mafioso must see for mob aficionados
3,mandalorian really hit home with me great cast amazing cgi and good writing you couldnt ask for more
3,when plugged in there is a build up charge one can constantly feel on aluminium keyboard maybe design is haphazard
3,followed the recipe word for word i let the pie cool over night but it was runny the flavor was great though guess i should have listened to other reviews and added extra flour
3,battery backup is not good as expected
3,trying to eat healthier used ground turkey also added minced garlic good bread crumbs and chili sauce
3,some of the greatest epics on film are about family star wars fast and furious sopranos and of course the god father trilogy and that is what yellowstone is its basically a mafia family with kostners character played like a god as don corleone but more on the violence this is such a well written show the attention to detail and exhibition of cowboy rancher life looks authentic the fact that the producers are ranchers adds to that they even toss in some real cowboys and the sound track i have never enjoyed country and cowboy rock so much put away any preconceived ideas pull out a beer or wine what ever u like and enjoy the ride yeeha
3,the handmaids tale is not only a cinematic masterpiece aesthetically wise but also by its incredible content ive watched other shows like breaking bad the walking dead and game of thrones which i very much enjoyed but this one may have to take the grand prize its terrifying and intriguing but also beautiful the actors and actresses performances are so raw and captivating in this dystopian story that you actually feel for them and might even shed a tear or two one thing i found interesting about this show is how they show you different sides of the characters as the time goes it makes you question whether or not a human is entirely good or evil a question that seems easy in this fictional world where consistency penetrates the society however this show also really speaks to me as a woman its scary to think about what the world would become if a crisis like this really took place but if i were to focus on the more political reasons why this show is good it has to be the vibrant portraying of women as well as gay people and people of color the film industry really needs more of these including shows but to make this short the handmaids tale is awesome
3,battery problem
3,recently started loving rockets i own a pair in black and a pair that are distressed ive found that the s fit me best i am c waist this particular pair seems to run true to size meaning i could get the s on which is typically what i wear in other brands but the s were embarassingly too small while the s fit and are made of a great weighty denim with very little stretch the wash was really not appealing due to the distressing of the wash all the lines butterfly
3,too pricey for the quality of this imported product
3,these looked so cute and colorful very sad to receive them yesterday and having to return them today cute overall but run large depending on cutstyle i range from in bottoms i ordered a in these and they were just way too big i would exchange for a zero but i bought them for a trip this weekend oh well consequence of online shopping
3,i ordered a size the dress was extremely large i am and weigh i guess you really must be like the model to wear this dress such a shame
3,the show makes you feel the full continuity of the human condition i am begging you to watch this and all its entirety to understand the characters to understand what it meant to be part of a rebellion the hard decisions you had to make for the utilitarian great or good versus hurting your own friends and family the actual decisions you have to make the grimness and war and the storytelling the art the scale of the show the architecture everything just leads to one cohesive beauty that is andor and especially in season two not as flash she is season one but the architecture is on a different skill the storytelling is on another level
3,one of the best tv series in this year dont miss this shiw
3,this laptop is good for general use performance is good as per price range pros build and design cons storage
3,i was very excited to try out this dress ive been looking for a velvet dress for a couple of years now and im not digging this one the fabric itself was a let down right off the bat its cheap looking to me ive seen nice velvet and this is very shiny thin and slightly sheer the dress cut itself is what i was expecting a loose baby doll type dress the length hit above my knees the overall effect made me feel very gypsyishmy husband gave a firm no when he saw me walk out of
3,first i love wool if its wool i love it if wool isnt your thing then this dress isnt for you i ordered this dress online in the burgundy it is not itchy it falls above my knees and i am it is warm and cozy with pockets which i love with the sleeves being short i am wearing a long frilly cardigan over it i ordered the small did not notice a size chart with this product i am usually a size or it fits great in the bodice but runs large through the hips however
3,i so wanted to love this but was underwhelmed ii am tall but yet it hit below my knee in that awkward spot that is just a tad too long to be hip stylish and too short to be evening cocktail just felt looked frumpy i do think it looks great on other reviewers though so may just be that if wasnt a good fit for my body type i wore my normal size and it just didnt flatter made me feel years older
3,poor writing terrible acting one imagines reachers deadpan mechanical delivery is because hes reading cue cards the plot is nonsense and in case you didnt notice that reacher is a very big man one of the characters will mention it if you wait a minute the plot is unrealistic the characters are cartoons the people are wooden amid all that gore and hatred no one is emotionally invested enough to show emotion the unnecessary gore and shock porn is sophomoric it insults the viewers intelligence scroll by there must be something worth watching somewhere on netflix id welcome a recommendation
3,i used oatmeal instead of saltines and did not add more salt the meatloaf was bland without sauce and i used coconut sugar instead of brown sugar great flavor on sauce i will follow recipe as is to get the true flavor and i used a meatloaf mixture instead of all ground beef i will make recipe again and post another review some times it doesnt work when substitutions are made from early on or first time following recipe my bad
3,just got this in the mail yesterday and i want so badly to love it but its just a little too big and boxy im lbs and ordered a small but i really wish id ordered the xs not sure if ill exchange or just return seems high quality and the pattern is gorgeous its basically exactly what im looking for until i actually put it on and then it just kind of looks like im wearing my grandpas old sweater
3,ill start by saying i dont think this show was bad but it wasnt quite good either i have not watched the original addams family show so i can not speak for the og show fandom but i can tell you as a potterhead they really took way too much out of harry potter school divided into groups sirens werewolfs shapeshifters the whole scene of the rowing competition the creepy store that reminded me of dracos store from the th movie statues moving and the secret passages i can keep going but really they overdid it with the harry potter references almost felt like a copycat show second i would like to point out the characters made no sense and they were insufferable wednesdays acting was good but her actions made no sense the blond girl was pretty much just used as a plot device at the end and her character was killed when she wolfed out because she pretty much did what everyone expected her to the villains were very predictable bianca was the only savable character from the bunch as i think they developed her decently also it wasnt clear to me which demographics this was targeted to it seemed a teens children and adults show all at once but somehow it wasnt appropriate for any id say this show is nice to pass the time good effects kinda predictable story and good casting but dont expect good characters and story out of this
3,update i rewatched it and knowing about the timeline jumps made it make so much more sense and honestly made it better now i love it i was really excited for this show it was so hyped up ive never read the books or played the games but the trailer looked great after watching it though it just felt sobland the acting isnt great the script is worse the story jumps around and is a bit hard to follow at times its not bad but i cant say it was good either the fight scenes are cool ill give it that i just cant understand the or reviews
3,this top is very nice i ordered it in black it looked very good the embroidery and pleated details give it a very nice look the fabric however feels like heavy cotton it didnt feel very soft and comfortable it was a bit hard for me to wear because i usually prefer soft cotton while i think this will retain its shape and not stretch like softer cotton i am sending it back it felt a bit heavy to wear
3,love the detail of this top however it runs large and had no shape on me
3,i wanted to love this dress because the fit is so flattering and the color is so great however i could not get the button along my bust to lay flat normally this can happen if the fit is too tight around the bust but i promise there was still plenty of room the fabric just bent in a way that left a gaping hole at my bust unfortunately its going to have to go back
3,ive only seen the first episode but its great and im hooked i hope the rest of the series maintains the quality of this first one the production value and set design is top notch the mandalorian is a stoic heroesque character the supporting cast of aliens are rough around the edges believable and thankfully no jar jar binks types at least so far i read a few reviews all of them great but none that i read mentioned jon favreau he wrote directed and produced this series and he deserves more shout outs for this awesome creation i am a mandalorian addict and i need more cheers
3,the show makes bold storytelling decisions explaining a really deep and large fantasy world for people who have never heard of the franchise before while developing three main characters at the same time with personal deep and epic moments while the execution is not perfect it works really well most of the time and if they learn from their mistakes and improve on future seasons the witcher name might live up to the name of other cultfollowing fantasy series as lotr and got
3,this top looks good on model and has great reviews online however it did not work on my bodytype when i tried it the slit in the front sat too low i dont like showing cleavage because i dress conservatively other than that i would have loved wearing it arm cut is not too big such it shows sides of bra bands overall fit is loose and drapery
3,i love dark film noir scifi stuff that is slow and detailed planning a heist on a bank or some high tech vault cool show me the days of planning leading up to it please use all of that preparation to build up the tension so much that when the heist finally happens my heart is genuinly pounding im rooting for the characters because i have been following their journey leading up to this point and i know the risks because the long preparation shows how difficult the mission will be ive always found it so weak when movies throw a wacky plan together in a scene of minutes then slap the label suicide mission on there to up the stakes a little bit main characters proceed and ofcourse complete the mission with flying colors maybe a side character dies why not movie characters doing stuff that is supposed to make my butt clench but then basing all their decisions on cliche assumptions and improvising everything just takes me out of the movies universe and jolts me back down in my seat i get that the lightheartedness is one of starwars succesful ingredients but my suspension of disbelief has a limit and starwars is the kind of franchise that exceeds it more often than not if its a suicide mission make it feel like it and that is exactly what andor does so well in my opinion the slow pacing might not be for everyone but if you can stick with it this is an absolute treasure of clever details making the starwars universe richer than ever before minor spoiler ahead i loved thoughtful details like the crew discussing whether the getaway ship they would steal from the empire would be fueled up or not and if the hangar has it mounted in brackets if so where is the release lever for those brackets if youre one of those people who finds themselves yelling at your screen how would they know what are the chances then go watch andor
3,these were really just okay the dough was really dry and i hoped the cookies would be less so as the butter melted but they werent it might have been because i used old fashion oats instead of quickcooking running the old fashion oats through the food processor might have helped with the texture i really dislike crisp cookies so i made them a little bigger than the rounded tsp and baked them for minutes but found even that to be too long i ended up baking for minutes and letting cool on the cookie sheet for minutes before removing to a wire rack they didnt really spread at all i used chocolate pudding mix because thats what i had and i think it was too chocolatey i also decreased the chips to cups sorry but i wont be repeating these im beginning to lose faith in the toh recipes this is the th or th one in a row that hasnt wowed me
3,not the quality that i expected from persilthe pods dont dissolve properly at low temperatures i am not overloading the machine i am remembering to put the pod at the back of the machine i find bits of semi melted pod all over the machine or worse the clothes
3,i have been looking at this top online today i tried it on in the store in a size small and xs regular i am lbs b and the xs fit better than small in the small the armholes were too low showed my bra this is the regular cut not even petite note i am on the shorter side the length was a few inches shorter than i would like glad i didnt order this online in petite i love the detail the material looks wellmade with the exception of the beading in one spot was alrea
3,the fabric is so beautiful that i am tempted to buy in a large size and have remade the waist is tiny the hips are wide when it goes to half price i may be tempted to take it to my favorite alterations lady the fabric is that exceptionally beautiful
3,it has almost everything great budget star wars feel cgi except the story or character development is just bad and boring it just does not keep my attention for some reason give it points for everything else being great
3,i love holding horses and i am always be size in their clothes dd curvy i ran into my local retailer to grab a shirt they had on hold and had to try this on because its so cute i couldnt get the zipped and it seemed to be rather narrow in the torso such a bummer
3,i loved this dress in the photos and couldnt wait to try it on in person the print varies from dress to dress and mine had noticeably much more cream color in it i didnt mind too much but it didnt look like the dress the model is wearing i bought the xxs petite which fit true to size the v neck is a bit low for petite sizing but the length was perfect on my frame which was a plus i agree with the other reviewers the fabric is cheap and feels cheap not something i would expect from
3,it is value for money product but laptop is getting heat except that reaming all is cool and good
3,i saw this dress in the store months ago and never forgot it so when i saw it on sale i nabbed it online so sad to see how this dress fits just right up top just right along the hem and then its a hot potatosackfrump mess in the middle its a shame because the fabric is beautiful
3,i have a problem with the size of these mini cards they are hard to hold on to and get in and out of my drift cameras they get stuck all the time
3,nobody writes about class divide and race like a rich white man
3,i think that most people thats seen the first season can agree that the carefully crafted adaptation and characterizations surpassed all expectations but while the first season improved upon key aspects of the tlou game the second season is trailing behind the tlou part in both structure and character development aside from episodes and some of the characters actions and motivations fall flat and the fragmented storyline is hampering the series progression despite some criticism of bella ramseys portrayal shes doing an amazing job with everything the creators have thrown at her good and bad the problems lies in the storys inconsistencies and lack of character tensions theres also a lot of holes in the logic behind having two girls infiltrating a place riddled with infected militia groups and insurgents without changing some aspects of the game but thats a separate discussion were yet to see the last two episodes but at this point theres little time to flesh out more out of dina jesse and abbys character to make this season worthwhile
3,the fit is a little bit odd it is short and wide too much fabric the quality is not good the buttons can easily break and the stitching was falling apart i am returning it
3,maybe there is nothing that can be done and it is just the way the technology is at this time but to me it seems that the gb sd cards have very limited uses at this time because they are formatted in whats called exfat instead of the standard fat to get gb from a gb card after receiving my card and inserting it into my new android tablet with jelly bean it was recognized and it did show i had gb available i then removed the card from the tablet and inserted it into my computers a win and a vista and tried to transfer files photos and videos from my laptop to the card they would not transfer after some research on the internet it appeared that the card had to be reformatted from the new exfat to the standard fat all my files were created in win xp and win vista fat i also have a win machine i recently purchased and can easily move all types of files between all the machines and memory cards and flash drives but could not transfer any files to this card from any computer as long as the card was formatted in exfat i had read on the internet about reformatting the cards and it working my win machine does not even have the option to format to standard fat it only has nstf and exfat my older computers have the older fat format option and it took my vista computer with a dual core processor hours to reformat the card to fat after reformatting i was able to easily transfer my files photos and videos on my xp and vista computers but not the win computer the card works in my tablet and i am able to access and use all the files i transferred to the card in fat with my vista computer on the tablet but after reformatting it now the card only has gb of space available so it was essentially reformatted the gb card into a gb card i will keep the card because i have a lot of work into it reformatting and transferring files and hopefully in the future i can reformat it again back to exfat if and when exfat catches on and an os is made that can seamlessly use files created in both fat and exfat this seems to be a good card that works well in certain situations but my advice do your research on what you have and how you will use the card because this is not simply a big gb card that can be used for everything in every device unless all your files photos and videos are in or will be created with exfat there are some real draw backs to this card and you might be better off just buying multiple lower gb cards if you really need this much storage space in a micro sd card or perhaps cards you already own can be reformatted into exfat and double the capacity if your computer has the exfat reformat option i have not tried it but based on my experience the last few days it seems like it would work if exfat works for you i gave stars because it does work but i feel sandisk not fully explaining how they are getting gb out of this card and the possible problems a consumer might have with it is misleading advertising
3,i love the shape at the neck but the lack of shape really distracted me from loving this top the fabric is nice but the big boxy shape on the bottom doesnt do much for you i agree with the other reviewers tha this top would be great as a maternity top because it really is cute if you have a baby bump returning the top
3,overall its pretty good cgi looks better than i expected visuals are stunning and the main characters do the roles quite well the story line is good but can be very confusing if you havent read the books jumping between timelines occurs frequently to help cover much ground this seasons two books in
3,i am a huge pilcro fan however these were beyond large i am not even sure that the next size down would work keep this in mind if you attempt these pants
3,i didnt have a subscription to hulu until the word that the handmaids tale was a favorite for award season i gave in and watched this amazing series the acting directing cinematography just brilliant while kind if depressing at the same time dark and stays with you huge fan of elizabeth moss who is so awesome and emotionally believable alexis bledel who i now have found a new respect for her acting skills ann dowd who is just so amazing samira wiley who is superb and madeline brewer just brilliant i hope yvonne strahovski gets credit for her role as mrs waterford remember hannah from dexter because she was one cold wife but yet i found myself feeling sorry for her i cant get enough of this drama and hope that season gets here quickly
3,love the knit color texturebut oddly a short and boxy fitand sonot flattering
3,this dress ran small in the arms for me when i returned it for a bigger size the dress i got had a huge rip in the decorative threading on the back i cant believe the product wasnt checked for flaws this huge before shipping i asked for another one in the same size well see if it too is defective
3,too soupy needs more flavor
3,bit sticky
3,im happy this toner has no added fragrances to it it is good for senstive skin yet still does the job im also happy that is contains witch hazel something that is usually hard to find the ingredients are simple and clear and it does its job expecting good results from this product this review was collected as part of a promotion
3,wednesday the gothic daughter of the addams family is getting her own mini series on netflix how does the young addams do since she is a misfit even in a school for misfits jenna ortega is the perfect choice for playing wednesday bad sensitive especially towards her brother a bad wolf rational and talkative in black and white thats one the addams family fan knows and loves little wednesday ortega but she also needs to be successful and above all to reach her full potential nevermore academy should take care of her where her parents met and fell in love growing up with the addams family i never thought a retelling of the beloved family would be any good dang i was so wrong even the idea of the thing was in my perception boring in todays day and age boy even there i was wrong just watch and make up your own opinion it really was touching me in creepy ways
3,stars for ortega stars for her delightful greyscale wardrobe stars for plot stars overall ortega wednesday myers enid and thing are mostly delightful in their roles the rest of the cast are adequate to forgettable it was good to see ricci in a supporting role even though her appearances were few this uncle fester was a bit off but at least he showed up this teen version of wednesday is fun more nuanced than riccis but the overall tone of the show unfortunately doesnt go as dark as it could have there were moments when i nearly laughed and only a few smiles along the way youd hardly know wednesday is at a boarding school as shes in class about seconds total the vamps do nothing and the rest of the kids barely show their creaturenatures
3,i wanted to love these but theyre so tight around the top my legs are normal size and i couldnt get them above my knee the top isnt stretchyit has a string that keeps it from expanding they are so very cute but unfortunately must go back for me
3,i wanted to love this top the color is wonderful in the pink and the material is silky soft it is huge though i am a dd and bought my usual small i am going to exchange for an xs and am hoping it fits
3,impressive performance in a slim package i recently purchased the dell core i th gen u new inspiron laptop from flipkart and i must say it has been a delightful experience so far this laptop combines style and substance in a sleek and slim design making it a fantastic choice for both work and entertainment design and build quality the laptops slim and lightweight design is highly appealing its easy to carry around and fits comfortably in my backpack the buil read more
3,the real reacher tom cruise who ok hes still a couple of inches short but this is the real jack reacher i so hope theres a second season soon the haters obviously have never read the books
3,i always watch series within a short period sometimes within a day but not more than a week so mostly i watch mini series or watch a new series which releases new seasons every year so that i can watch it within a day reacher was one such series i completed it within a day and found it engaging it is the same detective story where hero is smarter than everyone and kills the bad guys at end single handedly but it was not boring at any point i really like the actor who played the lead the female police officer and the detective since they were a good team the son of kliner was really evil other than that you dont have much in the series the emotional scenes were good if you are into action crime detective genre and have a weekend in your bucket this is a perfect one to binge watch
3,fit is just like stet in my opinion
3,very good and i am fully satisfied
3,the print on this dress is really pretty and the styling with the lace is a nice touch unfortunately it runs quite small in the bust so i had to return it for someone that is small busted it will be quite cute everywhere else it is true to size
3,i want to be fair with this one as some people may like it so here goesi made this in a glass pyrex x dish i bought all of the ingredients as written but did end up with cups of coarsely crushed pretzels as i did not want to toss them it still worked fine and amply covered the bottom of the dish the crème cheese layer worked best by beating the crème cheese and sugar and then folding in the whip topping as another reviewer recommended i was skeptical about the jello layer but followed instructions exactly and it worked fine i put in fridge after first layer for about minutes second layer a bit longer and def spread to edges as another reviewer wisely recommended jello layer chilled for a few hours sliced beautifully looked pretty on a plate did not top with additional whip cream and honestly it did not need any extra sugar so that would have mainly been for plating this is where i have to say it was way too sweet no way around it either but i may remove the syrup filled strawberries with fresh the other steps could perhaps be reduced in sugar but not eliminated as the sugar serves more than one purpose so aside from being overly sweet this would be a very nice desert i would never name this a salad or serve with a meal though
3,if you are a witcher fan steer clear of this seems even henry could not hold out any longer what good can come of a witcher serie if the writers say they hate the books and games not remotely loyal to the original story yet claiming they are telling sapkowskis story effects are low quality characters do not make sense when forced agendas are being implemented quality starts to suffer as season two was even worse than season one honestly i wonder whether the positive reviews are even genuine was really hyped when i heard about the series but now i cannot even describe my disappointment
3,this dress was cute but the fit was not quite right the bottom half fit well but the top half was a little loose it was wearable but i was worried after wearing for a few hours it would stretch out even more and look frumpy like other reviewers have said this dress really needs a belt to bring it together i ended up returning it because i didnt love it
3,im so disappointed in season three if season four isnt a step up i may quit this one season one was good with alan ritchson posing as a great reacher ive read all the books season two was good it one of my favorite books of the series but still good but season three was bad alan ritchson almost seems like he forgot how to play reacher and i hate it because this is one of my favorite series of books i really hope that season four can bounce back or i may have to shelf this one after three hopefully alan can watch the first episode and remember what it was like to be teacher again good luck
3,this top is super cute however the bottom hem is all frayedcouldnt really tell that from the pictures the flutter sleeves are too biglooks funny with the frayingruns a little large as well loved the color perfect with white denim
3,this was pretty bland i had added diced chicken breasts and extra black pepper amp even some korean chili powder but that was not enough what really helped was sprinkling some green onions over the top of the soup after serving
3,bought a pair of the gray and loved them but after i washed them i saw the color was distorted as if bleach from a previous wash was still in the machine so i ordered a second pair this one in green same thing happened after i washed it looked at instructions finally and it says to wash in cold water i washed in warm could that be the problem anyway now they both look like theres discoloration and not a washed look thats on purpose ill still wear them but an expe
3,i liked this top in black but it didnt fit me well had to return
3,i purchased the moss color in this cardigan i really love the texture of the material it is very very soft my issue with this is the arms like other reviewers have said they are extremely small i went up to a large rather than my usual medium and they were still tight i really wanted this to work but i will probably return due to the arms
3,if you can get over the fact that this skirt feels and looks awfully similar to the exact same fabric your drugstore halloween costumes had when you were a little kid then its surprisingly fun to wear
3,i bought this dress for a wedding i have this summer and its so cute unfortunately the fit isnt perfect the medium fits my waist perfectly but was way too long and too big in the bust and shoulders if i wanted to spend the money i could get it tailored but i just felt like it might not be worth it side note this dress was delivered to me with a nordstrom tag on it and i found it much cheaper there after looking
3,beautiful product
3,the addams family movies were truly my favorites as a child ive seen them both more times than i can count that being said this show is not the iconic s film or the old show or the classic cartoon so just dont expect that and go into it with an open mind i absolutely loved this show binged it in two days it gives tim burton does harry potter with a twist of nancy drew wednesday is completely endearing perfectly macabre her one liners hit every time i love the relationships she forms with her peers and i enjoyed the mystery of the storyline the cast is spectacular in my opinion perfectly creepy kooky mysterious and spooky
3,the fabric is great quality but it stretches too much around the waist making it look a little awkward other than that the quality is good
3,i had to return this because the lining is super short and uneven its shorter in the back and falls weird i love the color even better than the picture but quality is lacking for this high price i ordered the petite and it fit but the elastic waist shows any bump in your tummy too bummer
3,my husband and i both agreed that this dish was ok but not fabulous its easy to make but tastes a bit bland
3,the navy blue lines on my dress on the very top of the interior layer can be seen through the upper layer at the very top and it looks cheap for this price i would expect more thoughtful patterning the fit is amazing so i am debating whether i should keep or return
3,i literally couldnt sleep last night i was too excited for this its am est and ive already watched it twice the first minutes i felt moved along a little fast but the episode settled into a great groove once it got going cinematography special effects and sets were star wars but my jury is still out on the musical score overall a great start especially considering the high level of expectations that come along with the first ever nonanimated star wars tv series
3,soft cotton front slightly more coarse back shoulders run slimmer than bottom which flares out bought on sale as a cute pajama top which will definitely work well could also imagine with skinny jeans normally wear a s ordered an xs
3,this is absolutely huge it felt like it was at least sizes too big the empire waist wasnt even semi fit d chest and size small was like a tent however the embroidery was beautiful
3,i bought this sweater online and was surprised by how thick and fluffy it is this is a warm and cozy sweater more bulky than oversized pattern has a comic bookstyle art look it has raglan sleeves and a boxy cut and narrows a bit at the waist cute warm sweater for winterwore with an undershirt
3,i was so excited to finally find a work appropriate contemporary pant that i wore them about times in the first week needless to say they needed to be washed and i followed the care instructions by washing in cold water and laying flat to dry after just a single wash in cold water the pants faded to the point that they looked like they were three years old so sad luckily retailer took them back without a problem be warned these may need to be dry cleaned which is a lot of maintena
3,the color and embellishment of this top are beautiful this would look great on anyone super lean otherwise you just look really wide as there is no frame in the torso of this top at all the back picture shows it well i am lbs and i ordered the small and medium and both were huge with regrets going back
3,not bad at all
3,i ordered this item when it was first advertised fell in love with the unique pattern in the top and could hardly wait for it to get here however when i received the top i was very disappointed the fabric is cheap the sleeves are tight and the overall product is of poor quality and poorly constructed needless to say i returned it
3,rewritten incoherent chaotic this series has nothing to do with books or the story there writers are so inconsistent that main characters are jumping from one place to another end of continent in matter od hours people are finding themselves in the middle of nowhere as a coincidence this is just lazy writing yennefer the substitute mother are willing to sacrifice ciri for magic the common things with written character in books are only name had good book good story nah they rewrote it change it and clearly had little to noone orientation about actual world that was created in books henry cavill left series and was a big fan that says everything about this catastrophy
3,product is good only chrome no storage but windows operating system laptop is best
3,it is a cute top and i loved the fit and its super soft feel but im kind of getting tired of the sheer shirt thing this year i bought this for the summer and its hot here so not wanting to have to wear a shirt under my shirt its not crazy sheer but still undecided if you live in a state with no sweat youll probably be fine ill have to walk around and try it in different lighting situations and think about it
3,season is an amazing dark humor comedy showing real situations on the vacations but with a sense of humour and the plot that is captivating i love the character of the hotels manager which is complex and interesting there are so many plots in this season and on various level of depth that it is just great season is a real hit and miss the story is depressing and pessimistic since the first episode the characters are quite shallow it is just a huge disappointment after the season why dont you kill yourselves already a real bummer as the season was so great its just heart breaking that it could be done so bad if there is a season i hope youll go in a direction of season please
3,something is off with the filling wonderful crust and topping though
3,the lower part of dress bunches where buttons are so the dress doesnt look flushed from top to bottom i ended up returning it
3,two strikes against this top and its going back first the white top is a light weight cotton and it does not come with a lining or shell underneath just know you will need one i would have been able to get over that fact since i have tanks i could have worn but second strike is that it wrinkles alot it came out of the shipping box with the type of wrinkles that i know will get way worse after washing i am not interested in ironing anything for this price i wouldnt have expected b
3,dont waste money its very bad product automatic shutdown problem overall its waste of money
3,battery backup not good design is not as expected j otherwise do whatever you want
3,slow and expensive better options out there
3,i couldnt wait to try this soup due to the rave reviews except that is from the nutrition police it is a filling and tasty meal but i couldnt give it more than stars because to us it was just average i will probably make it again and maybe add more ground beef
3,everything is great pros the backlight keyboard looks so cool anti glare screen hz refresh rate screen decent sound quality best gaming laptop in this price segment best for programming web development android development video editing and other graphics works or any other heavy softwares run smoothly in this laptop i purchased this product in november at k if you get more discount then you should definitely go for this design is also good cons read more
3,i was expecting an ivorywhite cardigan with some lace along the sides with a more slim fit i am lbs b and normally wear a s or m so i ordered a m the sweater is at least or sizes too large in my opinion and not at all a slim fit but more of boxy fit the lace edges need to be trimmed up due to raw edges and strings hanging from them also the color is difficult to detect online but i was surprised to see that it is ivory with gray stripes not unpleasant but not as pictured as
3,i really wanted to love this suit but it honestly looked really matronly in person
3,i had such high hopes for this jacket based on the photo i even waited for it to come back in stock the detail is beautiful but it is shapeless and boxy for reference i ordered xs and i am usually a on top small chested it might look better on someone with a larger chest but looked like a sack on me so disappointing
3,i never read the books but good plot and good acting the more episodes you watch the better it gets i dont know why everybody is comparing it to got that i love as well because its totally different as an epic fantasy book reader im saying the more shows like this they make the better give it a try if youre into fantasy and supernatural shows season is nice
3,absolutely stinning dress statement piece for sure however i will agree with other reviews that the bust is small and has no give or wiggle room with the side zipperone if those dreaded side zippers that you always fear breaking as you dress sizing up would help but the waist then appears too big or bulky i am on the fence about whether or not its a keeper definitely perfect for the smaller chested i usually wear xs size the zipped the nearly did but wouldve smashed neverth
3,santa claus gift for our monthold baby positive points comforting and soft otter possibility to combine the different functions she breathes plays pretty lullabies white noises and lights up baby calms down faster with her negative points the engine noise and the sound of lullabies is a little too loud
3,i normally wear a medium in about everything and i bet an xs wouldve maybe fit me in this top its so billowy and not fitted at all
3,this is the best western series since lonesome dove absolutely amazing
3,i added cottage cheese or ricotta if you prefer and parmesan cheese i found that the ravioli dough is much thicker than lasagna noodles and it cooked a lot slower than i thought it would it also needed much more sauce than the recipe indicated as you are cooking it in the sauce next time i will cook them in water first then drain and continue with recipe
3,if i do ever make this again i would cut the cream cheese mixture in half
3,beautiful fabric and beautifully made but the pockets ruin it and i love pockets you cannot see from the photos but they protrude from the sides a few inches beyond the skirt and look strange and unflattering especially from the back they are unfortunately placed right below the hips and the effect is like those french bicycle baskets panniers if they were smaller and in the front the dress would work i am usually a size and both the and the fit me well not too snug or to
3,season was okay not great not terrible just just kinda below average i wasnt a fan of the pointless time skipping they did in there it added needless confusion to the story for no reason at all books didnt do that season terrible writers forgot what this show is called the witcher and there was almost no geralt in season i honestly cant say much about season here since i watched it some time ago and it was so incredibly bland i struggle to remember anything that happened there i just remember it was boring as hell season better than s worse than s it still sucked we got few short good moments where we get to see geralt in action and it was fun but sadly short and rest of the time was filled with this dreadfully slow story telling where basically nearly nothing happens or at least nothing interesting so you keep hoping for the next fix like a junkie please give me geralt fighting just one more monster its in the title of the show god damn it but you almost never get that the whole season had about good combat scenes with geralt in them lasting few minutes and that is all you get rest of it was mostly just bland and boring progression of story lines you dont even care about anymore since they were established so poorly the only redeeming part of this whole train wreck is henry cavil his acting as geralt is excellent which makes it all that much sadder he was forced to work under such terrible writers right now cavil left the show which is good he was the only thing keeping it afloat and without him its getting cancelled for sure why is that good well maybe in few years the studio will decide to reboot the show with actually competent writers who dont actively hate the source material and gives us the witcher which we actually want to see the one from the books
3,contrary to some of the reviews posted the dress is not excessively sheer you cant see black underwear thru the fabric but you can see the bodys silhouette in front of a light source its not lingerie sheer but more like a medium weight gauze without the wrinkles if youre older or modest the sheerness may bother otherwise due to the print it shouldnt be much of a factor now on to the size im a plus size girl size and based on reviews saying the dress was huge i ordere
3,i made this for a dinner party we had at our house first off for this many grapes at about pound cheapest i could find anywhere in february was over in grapes alone not a cheap dish to make when you add up all the ingredients i thought the cream cheese mix was tasty although heavy honestly thought with all the rave reviews that we would be wowed but in the end not one person of folks kids included mentioned that they liked it i would not make again
3,frosting was good
3,okay so this top has its redeeming qualities i promise which is why i gave it stars when i really wanted to give it two but its just not worth because im sure it works for some people and the quality is just impeccable for people who purchase this it will last forever its sturdy cotton not thin like many retailer tee materials the lace detail and texture is on point and the neckline is very nice its a great looking top my issue though wasnt with the bust as other reviewers hav
3,this dress is so so cute i ordered an xs and it was a bit longer in person than pictured but thats an easy enough fix since i know a good tailor the problem is that the dress isnt lined its made of thin seethrough cotton so it leaves nothing to the imagination for the price of this dress i would have expected it to be suited for more than just a bathing suit coverup without a slip underneath it if you can find a strapless one it is unwearable in most social settings its such a sha
3,over priced and over rated but its what the nephew wanted for christmas wouldnt use it myself
3,andor starts slow on action but if you make it to the third episode it explodes with a blaze of blaster bolts the pacing of the show is really well done and the story keeps an edge of tension throughout the first season stellan skarsgard is masterful in his roll and the show is well written as each character makes believable adult decision throughout the first season the show is broken up into four main acts and each one successfully builds on the next having been very disappointed by the last decade of star wars with the exception of the mandalorian and rogue one this series rekindles my interest in the star wars universe as i have looked forward to each episode as they have presented a compiling story one criticism is that besides luthen none of the main cast is that memorable and at points the story is alittle slow moving
3,i tried this on in the store in the xs size the pattern is striking and really makes you think of all the things you love about fall having said that i did not buy it and probably wont unless i find it on the sale rack later it is really more of a poncho than a sweater the fit is very oversize through the body and i tried the xs size it is also fairly cropped on me as i am tall i would only wear it with a shirt underneath the sleeves and not attached to the shoulder but start further do
3,this top is gorgeous in person but when i tried it on i fell out of love it didnt happen immediately but the more i wore it around the fitting room area the less i appreciated its beauty i tried it on in an xs i typically wear a s or xs in most retailer tops lbs for reference this top is just huge in the body the fit is very boxy and just not flattering yes it could be cute with skinny jeans and perfect for preggos this was just a miss for me
3,season one hawaii despite its deeper themes season one is without a doubt a comedy first drama second the first season of the white lotus follows the intertwining stories of multiple guests and staff at a four seasons esque hotel in hawaii delving deep into the ways in which wealth affects human relationships while this theme is persistent and it does allow for some serious drama and incredible performances especially from murray bartlett and sydney sweeney its main focus is creating ridiculous comedic situations caused by the oblivious snobbery and narcissism of the rich characters unfortunately this season never truly soars due to its prioritization of comedy over drama and its rather surface level social criticism it is still hilarious though season sicile straying away from season ones formula and narrative progression season two focuses primarily on the physical and emotional bloodshed caused by sexual desire making the ingenious decision of placing it in a location absolutely filled with violent and sexual art sicile all the while prioritizing dramatic storytelling allowing the much darker comedy to take a backseat to the better outlined and further developed characters and story presented in this season the plot itself plays out like a brutal and tragic italian opera full of infidelity lies secrets murder and even a slight aspect of the supernatural its pacing is much slower than the first season but it never loses the audiences attention thanks to great building of tension and tons of entertaining sequences the performances this season are also exceptional especially that of f murray abraham star of the oscarwinning film amadeus and meghann fahy who ill admit i did not know of before this but she deserves an emmy overall this season is far superior to the first narratively thematically and in many ways comedically overall the white lotus is an incredibly entertaining series that will have you laughing out loud multiple times per episode the production value is top tier which as to be expected with an hbo show and the writing comedic or otherwise never disappoints
3,the display is nice the battery doesnt stay for long will heat up soon i tried video calling it got heated up in mins and started making some sound speakers are average
3,this is a gorgeous top however it is very sheer and see through maybe the fabric would have been better if it was a bit thicker
3,being what most would call a casual star wars fan i have begrudgingly watched the sequel feature films hoping to experience the awe and wonder a little bit of moxythat i did when i first saw luke skywalker han solo darth vader and princess leia i am now years old and no star wars product since the original series has been able to do that for meuntil now before the mandalorian i never knew what it was that i loved about star wars it wasnt the special effects costumes or even universe yes i loved the characters but star wars was always more than any one character with the mandalorian i have finally realized what it was that i loved the genre spaghetti western in space there is something about the star wars universe george lucas created that elevates the genre even with a totally unknown character and obscure race like the mandalorians when used to tell an authentically star wars story i love it i finally feel like this show picks up where the original trilogy left off seeing classic star wars aliens like the jawas doing actually being jawas just renewed something in me about this franchise welcome home star wars i hope you will stay for a while
3,pon the arrival of a beefedup former war dogjack reacherin margrave georgia dead bodies start popping up in and around the small town parallelly the unofficial godfather of this georgian community is raising suspicions amongst local cops triggered by reacher of course in what new adventures is this iconic character from lee childs novels going to offer turns out the viewers in for some pleasant surprise in currentday world problems are aplentydrugs cybercrime human trafficking just to name a fewand reacher is here to take on the bad guys and combat an issue that screams of relevance and being topical alan ritchson and a blues fan this hobo selfproclaimed happened to be passing by margrave only because he had heard a rumour his favourite musician died there but as the catchphrase goes he always finds trouble after being roughed up by goons and policemen alike jack reacher alan ritcher finally realises that his being near the scene of the crime is no accident thus begins a slow yet peppy chase that navigates multiple sociopolitical hurdles that involve bullets flying out of dusty lanes and a lot of cussing one of the biggest hindrances that most television studios must overcomewith a character as mammoth as reacheris to separate the book from the series for the latter to stand out while rendering complete justice to its source material also it doesnt help in this case that tom cruise could very well be standing between success and jack reacher the show his film version is etched in the minds of those who have been ardent fans of the novella and of the star hence the reference thankfully alan ritchsons gigantic appearance towers over his affable costarsa recurring theme for comic relief in the seriesand any comparisons with cruise be damned as reacher in the prepandemic world ritchson is dreaded mostly distant and exhibits an outlook towards life that is partnihilistic and partcold you are an emotional dumpster fire his colleague screams frustrated if the action sequences and systemic tensionpeculiar to thrillersfeel easy on the eyes and natural then prison break scriptwriter nick santora is to be credited for it here he serves both as the helmer and the thinker behind those thoughtsinaction except for the muchneeded breathersbickering hilarious oneliners and the whole nine yardsreacher is by and large intense and gripping sure it could have patrolled at a faster speed especially the first few episodes but the element of intrigue and mystery heightens the excitement to a substantial extent towards the end so much so that you almost forget about the tedious buildup in episodes one and two forgiven lee childs inclusion has proved to be a major positive for the show as he reacher being his brainchild has contributed to retaining the characters quirks and eccentricities clearly winning brownie points from the loyalists loud omniscient yet obnoxious and largerthanlife are some of the adjectives we felt best describe ritchsons rendition of reacherwhich is not essentially a bad thing for an action protagonist to possessand his role is chalked out in a fashion that theres an immense amount of codependency amongst cast members for instance reachers highbrowness would not have been half as impactful and humourous without an uptight harvardreturn detective oscar finlay malcolm goodwin likewise the titular characters vagrant vibe is substantiated by his relationship with lady love roscoe conklin willa fitzgerald over the years reacher and his legend has seen many variations but this is by far the most thrilling enigmatic music teamed with unpredictable climax and an ensemble that has the potential for individual spinoffs having said that this eightpart series should have been put through a proper trimming session its not that its insufferable just a tad longer than perhaps needed in conclusion it is safe to say that reacherboth the character and this series is your quintessential modernday hero that has risen from the ashes and now finds himself in the st century dealing with technologybacked obstacles and he is here till he kicks some aes
3,so sad that this cardigan did not fit me i listened to the review i read and tried a small didnt come close to fitting i tried a medium and it also did not fit i think this item is designed for someone who has a small frame i seem to be too tall for the item and too big in the chest i usually always fit into a size mediumthat being said the cardigan is very pretty and feminine has an interesting design and is well made so sad this item didnt work for me
3,i made this bread for my daughter last night and we were both very impressed with its incredible moistness and heavenly taste thank you taste of home well be making this recipe as often as possible
3,i was very excited to get this but very disappointed once it arrived the fabric on the back is thin and clingy i think youd have to wear a slip underneath cute design on the front but sadly its going back
3,thats is awesome no lag no issue only battery drain issue but this range laptop was superb
3,here in tv show is just a woker omg this tv show is bad armors are like cheep plastic story is lame all this reviews are paid by writer lauren who shouod nevef touch witcher i m saying this as polish
3,i agree with a previous reviewer who said that it was very nicely cut but unfortunately the materials are so cheap the fleece material that it is made out of feels like the cheap polyester fleece blankets that you get at the discount stores it will pill easily and is noticeable even in the dark color i must have gotten one shipped straight from the store and it was already starting to do some gnarly pilling i do love the cut of it but i cant justify keeping it because this wont last
3,it looks smaller and lighter in weight and the design is also cool but the processing speed is not good
3,beautiful series and fantastic set the best art direction any project can ever get and absolutely flawless acting by the shelby family characters
3,after reading other reviews i ordered a small my usual size is a m it was huge all around its a beautiful print but i think it would make a nice maternity top
3,these pants come in great colors and fit nicely if you determine your correct size which may not be what you usually wear i have several pair but i am concerned about investing anymore because of all the complaints on dye stability retailer is going to have to address this if it is going to continue carrying this product now that said i had a bad accident on one pair of these pants and the outcome was successful i wore them to a dinner party and spilled grease on them from one of t
3,did not notice small hole and stain on the bottoms until i had the tags removed the return label shredded
3,drawn to the colors i tried on the top in my regular size m fyi c broad shouldersback short waist size or l in fitted tops this top is a cropped even for my shortwaisted body i would have to wear a cami under this is not just because of the cropped length top rides up w any movement but the burnout velvet is quite sheer the top is full so it easily exposes with any movement the back of slides up too the quality is an issue with exposed threads and irregular seams
3,church and religion the all white protestant maelstrom in away this is already happening i digress elizabeth mods is such a convincing actoractress the show is her and she is the show anyhow great writing and great story telling never read atwoods novel but i understand she is a fine writer her story to me could only be born from someone growing up in canada watch this

3,i tried this dress on in the store today and the armholes were so wide it showed my bra under the arm almost to the bottom and it showed part of the side cup of my bra at the front while the dress seems like it will be really comfy the arm cuts are so unnatural i had to pass i did try going down in size and petite and neither of those options worked to fix the situation
3,i had such high hopes for this top it is beautiful but it is very uncomfortable the lacebeadwork is extremely itchy the button at the neck seems cheap and i was worried it would fall off the beadwork and lace puckered on my shoulders making the fit off for me
3,i was so excited to get this dress i ordered the red and its a beautiful vibrant festive color i am smallbusted and lbs and i got the regular xs which fit very well fitted but not too tight i normally order petite but i wanted the dress to hit a little lower on me than on the model it ended up just above my knee and i was happy with that the shape is very flattering and i really like the scallop detail on the back v the fabric looks substantial but isnt super heavy an
3,tasty
3,this top has dry clean only didnt like the fabric plus mine was a return i also returned it because the left arm has a hole now its for sale again if your looking to buy a large dont
3,i got a medium as i usually wear that in everything i am a d and this pulled a bit across my chest and back it is a cute idea but the fit is off for my body i am and hits me shorter than shown on the model so hits at an odd length i may try to order a large and see if it is better on me because i am so hopeful for this to look cute on me the teal blue color is beautiful the pink is more a blush and washed me out the grey is just grey i bought three thinking this would be my go t
3,i wear a and sometimes a but i could barely squeeze these on in a the fabric is thick with lots of stretch but these are super skinny all the way to the ankle like a legging and not a jean made for much thinner frames than mine
3,received item exchange item selected as per the criteria but rejected by the agent the laptop supposed to come with microsoft office and antivirus but not happend who will get back to us about the microsoft and antivirus activation kindly help
3,i have the blue and gray and love the look and feel however the gray within days ripped at the seam and other areas
3,i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are i did not purchase this top
3,pretty top i like the flutter sleeve design the linen is thin too sheer to not wear a cami underneath the white nice for the sale price can easily be dressed up or down
3,finger print magnetic
3,performance is good fast boot up but it has heating issue it gets heated up quickly compared to other laptops at certain times speakers produce cracking distorted soundi had to call dell customer service and got my speakers replaced also on heavy load it gets shut down unexpectedly not fully satisfied but good purchase at this cost
3,the quality of the fabric is soft and thick and well made loved everything about it but if you are ample in the chest it is snug and does not hang and drape as well like on the model so you may want to size up i am sending it back as the fit is not flattering on me for the price someone with a boyish nocurve figure would look dynamite in it
3,i bought the tiny brand cassia tank last week in a small and it fits beautifully i ordered this sorcha tank in a small as well and it is huge i am very sad about the huge size difference look closely at the photos the fabric twists as it goes over the shoulders to the backit is quite bulky hard to tell if that would minimize in a smaller size my store doesnt carry this item so i cant easily try another
3,there is some problem in the keyword a bunch of keys stop working abruptly these keys include s caps lock and delete
3,using it for almost a week now pros premium look and feel fast and did not notice any lag havent tried any huge apps or games tried just vs code eclipse and asphalt it all ran smooth sound quality is very good but not too loud display is bright and crisp battery backup is great and chargers quick cons sometimes the laptop doesnt trun on when clicked on power button when not plugged in only turns on when plugged in to charge not sure if its defect or miss read more
3,the material deep color and design are gorgeous however the dress is just too bulky for my and lb frame i ordered a p and it just wasnt flattering on me its somewhat tentshaped so the fact that its not at all fitted and has a thick lining made me look larger than i actually am im so disappointed because the dress really is beautiful otherwise
3,i was really disappointed when this arrived and i discovered that its basically seethrough its well constructed its just a really thin material
3,when i first heard of the show it was being hyped as the next got im not much of a fan of got so i was hoping it would be a different take instead it pretty much copies it but its poorly executed the show is just boring not being familiar with the books or video games i ended up being lost in a bad way this is another show with poor showrunnerwriters henry cavill cant save this show from being very average
3,this dress is gorgeous but the cut of the neck and arms is designed for girls with a slim frame only i wish it worked the fabric and pattern are beautiful sad to send it back
3,i could listen to these guys all day accents awesome sam neill omggg he s great and all the hearts to cillian murphy for his gorgeous eyes and all round great presence everyone is terrific thanks for this amazing series we love it including off kilter soundtrack fun
3,actually he is well thought out and the thought behind it really great my daughter always fell asleep very quickly for music we used him months daily unfortunately he is already broken
3,i had high hopes for this top really boxy short
3,this was because they got reacher pretty close to the reacher in the novels the story was good and the cast was fine i would give this a seven if it wasnt for the fact that i liked seeing reacher on film nothing deep no great acting etc but it was entertaining
3,it works fine with my galaxy note it is hard to review now for performance but the price is good i think
3,shockingly given the historic of these things season is actually better than the previous season the whole thing seems to have more subtlety along with more thrill the story has become broader and grander beyond the almost stagesize storytelling of the last two seasons june has more sides as a person and many other characters have also gained complexity and depth to top it all up the choice of soundtrack is infinitely better all in all its a great recovery from the low point which was the last season not back to the original almostclustrophobic feeling of the first season but definitely just as sensitive
3,probably out least favourite ben jerrys ice cream too sickly too chocolaty still all gets eaten with smiles on faces but better flavours out there
3,no microsoft
3,this is a pretty dress but it runs at least one size too large the silk is of good quality it would be good for somebody who is slim and tall
3,ordered this online in the pinkish color the material is a little thin as a busty curvy lady this one just didnt sit right ran a tad large and looked boxy if you have a thinner frame may be a better look for you detailing is nice
3,the pilot of the last of us is one of the best pilots ive ever watched it is a seriously exciting terrifying and emotional episode of television the world presented here is fascinating and feels authentic as a post apocalyptic society i feel this series had so many interesting paths it could have taken the first few episodes set the perfect scene some felt episode long long time derailed the series but i personally loved it it was real life inside this new world it was a beautiful love letter to human relationships however as the series went on i felt the episodes were rushed the dialogue was cheesy at times the characters and the relationships werent developed enough the action fell away and the focus became telling too many half hearted stories the penultimate episode was well paced and the performances were excellent but in the end im left unsatisfied by the finale i have hopes for season and wont give up watching yet
3,im and always bought p they didnt have petite anymore so i bought r knowing that itll hit my ankle instead of being cropped its very cute as an anklelength with some flare my only issue is that the r was very tight around the crotch and upper thigh its a very tight fit just right there and not enough of stretch to be comfortable when sitting i wonder if it will stretch out a bit more from wear i then ordered a r to see if that fits better and it fits a tad loose ev
3,runs large and pocket detail is very prominent wanted a crisper trouserlike pantthis is not it
3,i really loved the color and fabric of this sweater i liked everything about it except how wide it was at the bottom i returned it for this reason
3,cute design with interesting details i felt it ran a bit large im lbs an was too big and baggy my biggest complaint with this skirt is the color its just not flattering
3,i like this shirt its quite lovely i ordered it in mint its nice to have a dressy tshirt
3,this dress is such a beautiful color and the fabric is super soft and lovely it would be stunning on someone with a slim figure but since ive got curvesan athletic build it simply did not work too bad because it is such a pretty dress
3,i loved the look of this shirt but full price was a little steep so i waited for it to go on sale and am glad i waited because only a l was left and it was perfect fit since i originally was thinkng of getting a small or medium which i usually do at retailer but this one was running really small compared to retailer other shirts the fabric is great but when i looked at it carefully the zipper construction is sewn poorly as well as the sewing at the buttons areaalso there were a lot of thread h
3,way too much ginger and nutmeg in this recipe i even had more apples than called for and it was overpowering cut back the cinnamon and just add a pinch of the nutmeg and ginger let the apples be the hero
3,as other reviewers have pointed out the bum is not flattering the pockets are wide and the fit sort of flattens you out bummer literally too bad i wanted these to work more than then cohs parker cropped the cohs win my wallet loses
3,yeah i liked this show i just couldnt look away from the carnage also because lots of what is brought up will be recognizable for lots of people people who found the characters impossible to like have a very naive view on humanity or esteem themselves much to high i liked it because it shows the ugliness and beauty of life and the imperfection of most of us we just make do with what we have that said lets try to be nicer people on the whole it will prevent lots of problems
3,love the product however its hard to spray would recommend though
3,bought this dress without trying it on but listened to the previous reviews saying this ran small and wow does it i usually wear a but ordered an eight which was hard to get on even with the upsizing i do have a ddd bust so i do have a difficult time when dresses have no stretch over give in that area overall beautiful dress fabric is not stretchy which killed it for me
3,i love this skirt in theory the style is fun and original and the quality was excellent however being suede the skirt was very bulky also at and liking skirts to be long enough for work i typically dont have problems with long length however i thought this skirt fit too long on me such that it distracted from the style i really wanted to love this skirt hopefully theyll make some updates in future styles
3,a brilliantly constructed complete story has been massacred by the scriptwriters i am a pole so i am not entirely objective but the series is fine in terms of acting geralt jaskier yennefer played very well the locations are also excellent but the story makes no sense and miss ciri needs gymnastic training she has excellent physical conditions but lacks coordination i have no illusions that the fans opinion will be heard but the series bored me the best part was the first episode
3,i dont usually write that many reviews to be honest but this was an exception this was literally the best show i have ever seen in my whole entire life im not even exaggerating at all a friend suggested this show to me and said that it was really good at first i was a bit skeptical but then when i started watching it i became practically obsessed with it because it was soooooooo good seriously it was out of this world strongly recommend and i suggest to at least give it a chance the acting is also really good and impressive as well as the music i really badly want to see a season for this show
3,not a bad pass time though i would say the first episode is the strongest its bingeable and i like its style tbh i find it to be quite a strong copy of caos chilling adventures of sabrina in cinematography styling aesthetics some character plots though sabrina was definitely better for seasons b they ruined it no turning back season sadly so maybe this will last longer as even though not as strong a first series netflix could ve trying to make up for the damage they did to caos and hopefully will keep good writers on and not put anything out thats not ready or thought through ortega acted well and totally carried her character the thing the hand was the most loveable characterfeature on the show tbf there wasnt anyone i didnt like i will likely watch season if they make one
3,just a warning i am always a or and even the was so tight in the waist i could barely out this on if you dont have a super tiny upper waist this wont fit well too bad because its super cute if a bit sheer
3,its beautiful and we love it the bad thing is that the pile ends right away
3,the fabric and design are gorgeous so i was hoping the top would work for me sadly it looked ridiculous on me i wouldnt recommend the top for busty girls it looked like a bell on me fyi it doesnt come with a camisole underneath
3,give favreau the keys to the star wars universe he understands what everyone else has been missing looks and feels like star wars not at all like the letdown movies that say they are star wars good start to the mandalorian do not mess this up disney you have restored our faith in star wars universe by having favreau take the lead cant wait for season
3,i loved these when i first got them they fit perfectly and are the softest and most comfortable pair of cords ive ever owned plus ag is the only brand of jeans i buy unfortunately they stretch out horribly within one wearing for such a pricey pair of cords im extremely disappointed im not sure if i shouldve sized down but now im wishing i had although im not sure that would make a difference
3,this is a cute tee but only if you get it on sale i dont love the material it seems flimsy and likely to get holes quickly the pattern is pretty cute but nothing special glad i got it on sale as with all retailer tees size down xs works good for me
3,the melodies are very soothing and not as intrusive as with other products also the light and the snoring function of the otter are quite pleasanthowever there are also some negative points as a cuddly animal for example the otter is not suitable at all and it is a mystery to me how in some reviews the talk of cuddly can bethe fabric is soft however the inner life of the stuffed animal is so huge and hard that it really cant be cuddlythe huge velcro fastener on the back of the otter is also very disturbing and can be opened very quicklyin addition the motor of the breathing function is so loud and annoying that it is not used in us at all therefore only stars for this sloping aid
3,took another reviewers advice and sized up to an xl unfortunately it grabbed around my midsection and wasnt attractive love the color and its dreamy soft the sleeves are attractive on less than toned arms my problem was with the side view which emphasized my tummy it clings and you could see a lot of my bra because in the larger size the armholes are large sadly returned
3,the last of us is without a doubt one of the best video game adaptations ever made the worldbuilding the tone the directionit all hits exactly where it should for anyone new to the story the show is gripping and emotional for fans of the game its almost everything we couldve hoped for almost my one real issueand its a big one for meis the casting particularly when it comes to ellie pedro pascal does a good job as joel i like him as an actor and while his version of joel works well enough i cant help but feel that nikolaj costerwaldau jaime lannister in game of thrones would have been a much closer fit to the original character he has that same rugged broken energy that defined joel in the gamephysically and emotionally but the bigger problem is bella ramsey as ellie and i want to be honest here its not just the acting though thats part of it her portrayal is harsher colder and more abrasive than the ellie i remember from the game ellie always had an edge but also carried a quiet warmth humor and vulnerability that made her lovable in the show those qualities are mostly missing theres very little softnessshe comes across as consistently aggressive and guarded which makes it harder to connect with her emotionally on top of that i simply dont think bella ramsey was a good visual or aesthetic match for the role the original ellie had a distinctive expressive face that was both tough and endearing bella by contrast has a look that feels jarring in the roleunusual in a way that pulls me out of the character and i dont think its shallow to say that physical presence matters in casting especially when the original material is so defined by a certain emotional and visual tone there are countless young actresses out there who could have nailed both the acting and the aesthetic more closely i disagree with the decision to stray so far from that looks arent everything but they do play a partespecially when the original character is beloved and so carefully crafted to be clear the show is still fantastic its a mustwatch but the casting of ellie in particular feels like a misstep in an otherwise nearperfect adaptation
3,i ordered the petite in my size since im well petite but curvy i recommend this dress if you dont have a lot of boobage unfortunately for me the waist line came up high an inch below my bra line and made the dress poof out at my hips in an unflattering way its so pretty and i was really excited about ordering it it fits but just is not flattering because of my boobs this is always my problem though with dresses
3,i by this lap k battery drain fast disappointed and touch pad is very legyy only show do not buy it
3,the body colour was lossing we must need to buy laptop skin
3,beautiful top i love the peplum the color is actually cream with blush accents in the lace i gave it two stars for quality because the hem was uncut and unfinished so its going back
3,i trusted this company but they only warranty their products about two months i used the micro sd card in a go pro camera for approximately one filming hour and the third time i inserted it into the camera it showedno sd card after further investigation the card was determined to be bad amazon will not stand behind the card and i am out this is a rare situation with amazon they are usually very helpful when a product is no good so this very well could be the sandisc company behind the short warranty when you pay this much money and the product doesnt even last two months it should get no stars but then you know i cannot do thatupdate amazon did replace this card after i sent it back to them so i upgraded this review to three stars
3,after watching the episodes of the handmaids tale i can safely say that this is a real horror story after each episode i find myself dazed often with tears in my eyes and that is the truth with that said the story and character arcs are so good it is worth the melancholy emotion i understand how the dismal tail won emmies for a tv series there is all love drama thriller sex combined in a very unexpected way it doesnt have a thing youd like to throw away from the film its complete and organic our days tv shows has grown in something bigger it became a real movie with a row of episodes definitely new era in filming the handmaids tale is a compelling albeit extreme experience of sexism sadism and the triumph of the human spirit the story line set in the future reminds me of the holocaust in its other worldly how on earth did this happen perspective i couldnt stop watching it excellent must see program
3,beautiful ordered a s i wear a in most retailer items hand washed in cold water shrunk inches yes inches love maeve clothing this shirt is gorgeous before hand washing in the sink it was large and flowy now it barely fits
3,love the top love the color love the back detail as a larger chested woman the shape was lost a bit but i just couldnt resist
3,i read the book some years ago and despite remembering the entire story i still couldnt stop watching this series if you havent read the books this series still stands on its own offering lots of action with an almost superpowered hero who has chosen to help those who have been wronged by fighting the bad guys plus reacher is hot will be waiting for season
3,pros the display is decent performance is good till nowdelivered yesterday fingerprint works fast sounds decent cons thunderbolt will not support type c charging you cant use it for charging it is only used for data transfer and display output dont purchase it if you think you will charge it using the thunderbolt port you have to laminate the screen else you will see some lines due to keyboard space not screen damaged battery life is short or hours bac read more
3,this shirt is really cute but a little stiff it does come with a slip but the slip was tight but the shirt fit maybe even a little big i used another cami under which was better i think think the sizing is off in terms of slip vs the actual shirt i got it in the store with the off so it was a good deal it does stretch out as you wear it so it will get bigger and it did make me look a little bigger but still cute on and for a summer shirt its thin so it does work well in that r
3,i was excited about this such a lovely look online but on meit was just meh im a little heavy right now so that could be playing into itbut i will say i loved the top part of the dress very flattering and subtly sexy but the bottomit just hangs like a rag it needs either more material for a swishier effector it needs to be a different material or maybe knit just doesnt work on me in the form of a dress the knit is nice but i kind of also feel like it is chintzyi cant
3,i got this for k during the big billion sale with exchange within k this is a steal deal otherwise dont buy it for k as the display is mediocre processor battery is okay performs as mediocre dont expect huge performance as this is normal spec laptop not for gaming or professional usage i am disappointed with display which is just basic hd and not like asus oled but again within k go for it
3,i liked the fact that it was small as for the recipe i cut the water in half and used half white half brow sugar with the peaches i wild have liked the top to have been more crisp
3,as with most retailer tops this sweater is boxy and baggy through the middle i ordered an xs its a very nice pretty sweater that im going to try in an xxs the vneck does go down rather low so it will need a tank underneath the lace accents are very delicate and make the sweater look more upscale the white is a soft winter white
3,the color of this top is lovely however i felt the quality was lacking for the price the fabric is thin and the top i tried on in the store had some loose threads already fit was tts for me
3,laptop is good but processing speed is very poor battery performance is good something hours battery backup
3,i do not want to dig too much into whether this is as the book is or not i did like the interpretation of tom cruise i did like the interpretation in the series in both cases first go at it was excellent and in both case the second go at it was much worse in case of tom cruises interpretation it was still watchable and entertaining albeit much lower standard than previous attempt in case of the serial the second season is just boring i do not mind budweiser advertising in the second season too much but i have impression that quite some boring scenes team building were not done for anything else but that maybe it improves eventually i have not watched the whole season in full yet but it is pain to get through the first few installments and i really do not care if this is as per book or not the story must be engaging and i do not feel it is also the first season had a story that was really convincing from character building through the interactions between them and till the criminal story although the later was a bit ott in my view but well in the limits of the entertainment that this is so far i do not see well done character building the unit background scenes are not convincing as are the ways the team goes about its task the dialogue is very artificial and things happen just to move the story from a to b i admit i had a problem finishing the nd installment already and did not manage the rd i will come back probably because i liked the st season a lot but i really hope they improve on the story and character building i liked budweiser commercials from the past but you cannot build the whole series around that guys written
3,i love boiled wool and have gotten a few items from retailer in years past that i have loved this one was a fail i typically wear a small and it was slightly too big and shapeless for me i am c the moment i put it on it felt like i was wearing a bathrobe it flares quite a bit and the stitching is brown and not dark grey like i was hoping the quality is as expected the color overall is as it looks online but it was a return
3,i absolutely see why cavill no longer could stay with this project even the butcher himself cant withstand this kind of bucthery beyond bleif how they ruined something with this much potential and great source material i am currently watching the other half of season and i had to just stop and come here to share my utter disgust they story telling was rough already in seasons and but now it is basically unwatchable i hoped that it would not come to this but i genuinely think that i will not be returning to watch this any further as a avid fan of witcher franchise and henry cavill a i feel sorry for both of them
3,this is not the witcher unfortunately the show rewrote too many plot points and ruined the story its an ok hollywood fantasy series but thats not the point its just a repeat of every hollywood trope immaginable it was written by americans for americans and the witcher was not that it had beautiful complex characters with their own individual flaws and talents as someone who loves the books i have never been more dissapointed
3,beautiful cuddly music box with very pleasant sounds the only drawback the music box lights up at the belly where it is also switched on and off my child grasps the light and the clock is already off
3,the wide legcrop is a cool trend but not great on me im pretty standard in sizebuild lbs size i felt like i just looked oddly shaped with them on and maybe this is the issue the size my normal size in every citizen pant i own was about whole sizes too big for me i mean i felt great about myself butwowza when i took them to the store to try onexchange they dont even carry them in the store so i just returned and will try something else
3,charging is very bad remaining good
3,i am a pretty consistent size or ordered these in my usual and yikes right out of the package knew theyd be way to small they have a lot of stretch in them so i was able to get them buttoned but they were wayyyy too small and looked awful i returned them for a which i am still waiting for ill update this review when they arrive other than the size issue they were just as picturedexpected
3,s is definitely different than s and s less comedy more drama more weird stuff really weird still has that dark humour note and as season progresses characters are becoming more relatable and convincing still not the level of first two seasons though although an anthology series story is pulling some stuff form earlier seasons connecting and going towards wrapping and thats a good little addition acting is actually good as it is for the entire series scenery and cinematography are the real treat and the score and soundtrack are getting better and better with each episode overall not as good as the first two but far from bad let alone disaster very good
3,this shirt is not what i expected i ordered the green motif which is not green at all but black in the product photos the drawings appear to have a white outlining but its brown the shirt is made of a good quality cotton and fits great i ordered the medium which gave me a lot of extra room to where i could have sized down to a small for reference i am a b and usually wear a medium in most retailer tops i dont plan on keeping this because i was really hoping for a white background to t
3,excluding battery all over fantastic and for flipkart please break the collaboration with jeeves for installation theyre very late for all do their work so i cancelled jeeves
3,sound is not good
3,i made this but cut the recipe in half for two people it wasnt bad but seemed to lack something rather bland for us this is not a keeper i didnt like the clumping of the shredded provolone cheese
3,only days use its too good now will see in future days
3,sweet guy but he doesnt help to fall asleep the noise level of the engine is unfortunately made in chinaour son has been having sleep problems for weeks because you are close to despair you just try everything that the marketing of the baby industry gives of course without success noises and songs are quite nice but is the technology in there very big and heavy our month old child i dont want to put that in parlor cars
3,this top is very cute but i found it runs small in the bust which is unusual for maeve i will have to return it you may want to size up if you have a generous bust
3,this laptop very slow
3,so this shirt is adorable soft fun lays nicely but you should have your arms amputated and replaced with a barbies before you put it on i dont even have large arms the medium fit me perfectly but then like i hulked out the arms and there are now little tears at the seams this was all very confusing and vexing as this shirt is otherwise perfection i mean im not a large but i guess if i want this shirt i will need to take it back and get a large otherwise it will be sleev
3,the consistency is much too loose to be considered chili will add cornstarch in order to thicken next time
3,average rating
3,it was okay my husband really liked it but me and the kids didnt i wont make it again but i must say the italian dressing went well in it
3,the power button is not god we have to press it for to otherwise it do not open
3,but as i am writing this i dont think there has been any better tvseries ever made hat is off well done
3,i really want to love this dress the style and colors are so nice and easy i like the loose flowy feel of the dress it runs a tad large but that is part of the style what bothers me is that the fabric and embroidery is very stiff and itchy to the point where it is uncomfortable on my arms and body even though it is a loose fitting dress also it has lining which is nice for modesty but with the stiffitchy factor mixed with lining it feels a bit cumbersome i havent decided if i will k
3,i made this exact recipe and it was too grainy and falling apart and too sweet it wasnt horrible but its not great corn bread either
3,i love the look of this dress and the material the problem is that when i tried it on the fit was a bit off it seems that the arm holes hung down way too much and pulled the dress so it is uncomfortable to wear i dont think i could have gone down or up a size to make this dress work it is a shame because i really liked the look of it
3,this piece is stunning you can dress up or down with it my husband said wow thats very elegant it is very soft thin but warm however it came to me with numerous holes along one strip of fabric i returned it for another it is a very delicate fabric the zig zag stitching may snag easily im afraid it will not wash well definitely a hand wash item im not sure i will keep it in the end the design i thought should be a star because of the look and versitality of the item quality
3,omg i laughed so hard after i put these on i was so excited to get them i ordered them in my usual i got a little suspicious when i pulled them out and noticed they had an elastic waist band they were a little too small for me and even if they were not its hard to imagine a world in which they didnt make me look like an oompa loompa or a hobbit they are beautifully made and i kept looking at the picture and wondering why they dont look like that on me i definitely have a curvier sh
3,the white lotus is a deliciously dark satire that hooked me from the first episode and didnt let go until the credits rolled on the season finale this series isnt just another vacation drama its a captivating exploration of privilege class and the complexities of human relationships the stunning backdrop of the luxurious white lotus resorts provides a stark contrast to the unraveling lives of its guests the ensemble cast is phenomenal each actor embodying their flawed and multilayered characters with remarkable depth the dialogue is sharp witty and often brutally honest making for some truly memorable moments while the series has its fair share of comedic moments it also delves into darker themes exploring the often toxic dynamics between the wealthy and the people who cater to their every whim its a show that doesnt shy away from social commentary offering a biting critique of modern societys obsession with status and materialism the writing is exceptional with each episode expertly building tension and suspense the plot twists are unexpected and the ending is both satisfying and thoughtprovoking the white lotus is a masterclass in storytelling and i highly recommend it to anyone looking for a series thats both entertaining and intellectually stimulating
3,used to feel that i wasted money on this but after few days i started loving it btw i shifted from a windows pc so experience was not the same because of os
3,im and about lbs ordered the small because i do have some curves it was huge more like a large and didnt have much structure at all the wool was very soft and stretchy and like others have said kinda orange not true coral color it fit me like a throw blanket its going back for sure might purchase again if the petite xs is back in stock and on sale this should def be under
3,love the way this dress looks online sadly it doesnt look great on me im athletic build the small fit perfectly but the extra fabric in the hippocket area just seemed to drag me down i really wished this worked for me but i think youve gotta be a little bit taller to pull this one off
3,sound quality is too low
3,this dress is very pretty in person it fits true to size and is very figure flattering one other reviewer mentioned it is a bit low cut but i think that can be resolved by wearing a cami underneath to cover cleavage my only gripe with this dress is that its a little rough and stiff feeling i am really sensitive to that and only buy things that are velvety soft it probably works for most people but not for me so had to go back
3,good but not very good
3,this has got to be the most boring lack lustre thing to come out of the star wars universe so much unnecessary talking most of which does nothing to enhance the storyline its pretty much dribble the story line itself is nothing special the script writing is terrible really basic really boring the acting is about as low grade as you can get definitely bottom of the barrel i hate to sound cruel there is just nothing id expect for the calibre of star wars when you get past all the terrible parts of this show there is some good parts i enjoyed not going to spoil to clarify im not a hater of the new star wars content most i genuinely enjoy but this was a massive fail in my opinion
3,battery performance is not to the mark and sound quality is very low other features are okay
3,this laptop is very good considering the price range in which no more options available in the market but yet there are few cons you need to consider before buying it limited storage slots it comes with only m nvme slot so in order to expand the store you have to replace the original with a new one the build of the laptop is totally plastic so it cant handle any sudden damages even with gb graphics card it struggles to provide decent frame rate in most of the games go read more
3,battery backup is very low they could have given fast charger at least remaining things are ok build quality looks not so good no functional issues for week usage
3,thin rayon material seethrough and unlined size down as this runs large for reference im lbs size in jeans in retailer clothing i wear sz small or size i ordered this in small but the body and shoulders are too wide and unflattering especially with the shorter length of this top that is why sizing is key i know it is meant to fit loosely but you will have to order a size down otherwise you will look larger and the dark piping details on this top will not fall in the rig
3,season was worth tuning in for season season writing was just plain bad i think the writers were more concerned with pushing a woke scold message than character development not coming back for season
3,everything about this episode was amazingly portraited and is definitly one of the best of the series so far
3,the first season was very promising great in the art department good production acting building up suspense and creating a unique dark vibe the second season follows but halfway you start to wonder what youre watching nothing of note really happens its like epic stretched scenes and not much content or story it becomes boring leaning heavily on that same atmosphere the first season delivered which is interesting it just needs more interesting content i finished season and thats where i gave up reading the reviews this only got worse in the further seasons so i guess it was the right moment to let it for what it was a good first season
3,in itself a nice cuddly animal unfortunately the volume of the engine disturbs us if the animal lies next to the babys head one hears it clearly furthermore the engine is also very poorly padded for almost the disadvantages outweigh
3,seasons and were absolutely brilliant they had some gut wrenching scenes and even after i switched off i couldnt stop thinking about it there was so much pain tragedy and angst the cinematography and score is beautiful through all seasons season was completely different to the first two though so slow and boring until the last couple of episodes also they completely changed junes character and she became less likeable and relatable the sneering and eye twitching drove me crazy id probably only rate season at stars such a shame i hope season is better
3,i bought the orange in xxs petite and the cream in the xsp as it did not come in xxs i like a swing style but this is a tent the material in the cream is fairly sheer and i found hanging threads that came from suspect seams the overall effects was being lost in all the fabric they rather skew old school maternity in summation mine are going back
3,while the pie was quick to put together it just tasted sort of blah i will make this again but will add spices to the filling as written the filling has a strange sweet jelly texture that lacks interest
3,this top looks real cute on the model wish it looked like that on me way too big so not flattering on my petite frame sadly going back
3,not sure what all the star reviews are about i was disappointed my husband liked this because it was spicy my kids and i did not i had to make a second dinner for them after they begged not to eat it it will give you lots of gas too
3,made this for dinner tonight and the gravy was super thick i wish i had stuck to my instincts and put about half the flour in it or maybe used cornstarch instead also with adding the milk its more like a cream gravy and i prefer a rich traditional chicken gravy not terrible but wont be a keeper for our house
3,this dress has a beautiful purple paisley print and reminds me of classic retailer from years ago i wanted to love the dress but it runs extremely large i usually wear a p or xxsp and got this in an xxsp but was still way too big while the intent is to be flowy i was overwhelmed by the bagginess and it changes the style from flowy to baglike while the belt helps cinch the waist i had too much bunching in the waist area making it unattractive very disappointed as its such a pretty
3,i love the reacher books and am enjoying the tv version unfortunately it is a shame that the budget doesnt seem to stretch to better actors i dont recognise any of them and some of the are just awful the writing is a bit clunky and the director is just not doing his job when really badly delivered lines are allowed into the final cut i also am disappointed in the amount of effing and jeffing in the show the books contain very little strong language but the tv version is peppered with unnecessary f bombs which grate on me american shows seem to think they have to do this now and are ruining good shows the good wife was ruined by itand only murders in the building could be good but the language spoiled lets get some quality into the next series please
3,i purchased these on offer however i was kind of shocked to see just how small they are i know its a concentrate but is it really any more of a concentrate than the big litre concentrates which if you consider full price then the big tubs are so much cheaper imo
3,i loved this when i saw it arrive in the mail as soon as i put it on though i was drowning in it i know its a cape and it is suppose to be large but it was so big i had to return it i still really like it and wish it would have worked i am athleticslim figure just for reference
3,very cute and would transition well season to season with different bootsbooties didnt lay well on chest for me returned it
3,on paper this would sound boring a show about a man handling his ranch in montana but this show is one of them shows that has no right being as good as it is it wont be long when youre watching that you believe you could be cowboying on yellowstone ranch the scenic shots are just breathtaking the acting is believable and thats due to top notch casting this will be genuinely missed when its gone thankfully the popularity of this amazing show has spawned shows like set during the oregan trail and the new staring harrison ford and helen mirram both shows cover the characters ancestry of the dutton family i believe these shows will wet the appitite of any true die hard yellowstone fan
3,man have i been waiting a long time for a good show do you miss the days when movies and tvshows were created purely to entertain you look no further this one is it an amazing drama set to a ranchers family in the us great character building with deep characters some who you will grow to love others you wish you never met and others who grows on you and you learn to like them even respect them once you get to know them i have watched this show times and the spinoffs as well the one is a masterpiece the storytelling is pictography soundtracks storyline characters entertainment value recommended this to all my friends and family and the verdict is in go and watch it it is the best show created in years
3,i ordered this dress and have sent it back i think it could be a flattering dress the waist hit quite a bit above my natural waist which made the entire thing fit weirdly i am very long waisted so this might just be a problem for me i ordered regular size
3,i actually have no idea how disney made a watchable series out of star wars i guess at some point someone might win even at roulette its totally watchable some moments are actually quite good its not an amazing show or anything but it does canon quite well without much destruction someone else said it was rather adult but it isnt its just not juvenile and not made for kids who should still be suckling on moms teat this is how to make an ok show when you have millions of dollars to throw at investments keep these kind of shows coming and maybe just maybe ill stop shorting disney
3,why does the ingredient list say cups of flour but they only tell you to put into the dough plus some extra i put in a little extra to make the dough not stick but that was no where near cups total i hope im not making this bread all wrong please fix the directions
3,material is very thin and although this is apparent in the design i just didnt like the way the cuffed sleeves felt
3,got it for k during the sale everything is pretty good but the speakers are not up to the mark pretty low volume output
3,every single word that have been said across the whole episodes have a meaning have a value even better than this is by far the best star war work ever the mandalorian sure it have less robots laser swords also less aliens less force than other star wars movies shows but the story the acting the politics the music the emotions are unbelievable what you notice that every single detail of every single object custom or person that appear on the screen is truly amazing i really want to send a thank you from my heart to every single person who got invovled in creating such master piece
3,the shirt design is very nice but it fits very loose it will not look good if you are heavier as this shirt will make you look wider because of the baggy fit the sleeves though are fitted and feel a little tight the material of the sleeves also is very itchy and feels like some wool material
3,amazing performance just the battery health is little low if with update it can be fixed then it would be an amazing product at this prize range
3,nice to
3,i received the moss skirt today the material felt very soft and like good quality im lbs and had ordered size regular unfortunately the skirt was huge and also very long below the knees the cut was not flattering for me as the material stuck out very wide on the sides possibly a smaller size and petite would help but are sold out already in moss plus im not sure the sticking out would be fixed that might be the cut of the skirt it didnt work for me and i will be returning
3,its perfect for the students who want basic laptopgives good performance and has good battery lifeit offers everything a budget laptop can offer except the screen display quality is not upto the markevery else is fine
3,there is a very bad display quality so dont buy it
3,i wanted to love this it is so cute and the xxsp my usual size fit perfectly however there was a fatal flaw in the construction the hem was not sewn properly very asymmetrical and lopsided instead of a scoop like shown on the model it was much longer on one side than the other i thought maybe it was just how it hung on me but i took it off and laid it on my bed and i could clearly see that it was sewn wrong this is going back i ordered another one now its on backorder hopefully
3,you need to watch it all to appreciate it not one or two or skip a few as some critics have been guilty of the show does start off slow but felt so short by the end of it its worth the watch some things to note cavill is believable as geralt and makes you forget hes playing the character yennifer is the more relatable character with nonfantasyvg viewers the witcher is based on a novel series the game came after so dont think of this as just a video game adaptation video game knowledge not really necessary you dont ever need to play it and enough information on the internet is available if you need to know certain terms beautiful scenery sets costumes it really is great to watch especially in hdr the antagonist seems cliche but you might get a sense that something is up
3,laptop is best for study type
3,beautiful and good quality dress the pictures nor the description really show or mention the keyhole cut at the front neckline you really have to look very closely at the model photos to see it unlike the model i have curves and this dress showed way too much cleavage for me
3,good product performance is good
3,i really wanted to love this but the length of the pants was so awkward and dowdy if they were longer or shorter this would be a win nice fabric not too clingy so it is attractive on top and hips
3,i personally love this romper theres a lot of fabric to it so it feels lush and substantial and the pockets theyre so roomy i actually couldnt find my phone for a hot second the crotch of the legs because yes this thing is actually pants is very long and so i was very comfortable sitting the two things i dont love about this piece include the downfall of all rompers imo not bathroombreak friendly you basically have to disrobe and since the legs are so long you end up clingi
3,this dress was sooo cute online and in the store i hands down would have bought it but i had an extra few minutes so i decided to try it on terrible the dress looked awakward on me the strings lacing strings had town on a few spots and it just was not flattering for a curvy girl now i know why there were so many in the store which is a rarity for my location
3,it was ok
3,these are the very stretchy almost spongy type fabric i ordered my usual size and they fit me like a sausage skin crazy small
3,very very cute bought in store yesterday put it on today to wear and it is huge i normally buy a large in tshirts i will return for either a small or medium but will try on in the store oh well
3,the fabric was more southwestern looking when i got it than it looked in the pics it fit a bit larger around the bottom than i like
3,i ordered the green and lilac the pink color was not offered when i placed my order so that was not an option i found that it ran true to size but was a loose fit the lilac color had white streaks from the thedyed effect but it looked like someone had spilled paint on the front in one area so i did not even try that one on for now i am keeping the green one but it is a deeper green than pictured and also a looser fit than on the model i do like that it is percent cotton and very so
3,i found the fit of this dress to be true to size with a flattering bust and waistline however the fabric feels cheap and doesnt drape as nicely as id hope for the price this would be a lovely dress in a better quality fabric for sizing reference im lbs dd and took my usual size xs though im busty for my size the top provides nice coverage
3,this is a super cute tunic it is simply way too big
3,everything is good except battery
3,its very nice and soft but in my opinion its not worth the price it doesnt do so many things as i expected and its also a bit noisybut its nice the ideamy son of months doesnt consider it much unfortunately
3,perfect laptop except heating issue
3,while i recognise and appreciate the intention to do something different this show doesnt work for me in creating something more realistic they have taken out all the fun silliness and excitement which is part of the star wars appeal i watched it all because i wanted to at least fill in the gaps in the story but not sure it even provided that feels like a waste of time now i guess this show makes sense for disney as it allows them to retain some people who have become disaffected however i think that there should be consistency of tone across sw give this responsibility to filoni will be giving s a miss unless there looks like being something tangible and consequential in the plot
3,my normal size in the hyphen chinos fits my size body very well these selvage jeans were too tight in the hips too loose in the waist and too tight in the knees and i dont have big knees also the cuff was down to the floor instead of ankle length cuffed they seem to have a inch inseam and these were regular not tall basically i think you need to have a straight up and down shape with no curves and very long legs for this jean to work
3,i like this show but i do the characters are absurd and the stories beyond the creativity of us sane folk jenna ortega of whom i had never before heard or seen is a hoot a beautiful young woman with eyes that offer a hint at every thought badass women of any age definition sarcastic uncaring dark morbid and aggressive but not dangerous or hateful get my attention i share this morbidity and sarcasm and laugh at my own such comments no one else sees as funny having confessed the most alluring to me about this show is her observations and comments i would write much more of the same into her lines i am and imagine some portion of all ages will find something fun in this series fun show wide variety of characters the good ratings may result from the creativity of the stories and variety of characters an aside i am not at all a fan of any hollywood billionaire and gravitate to series that use new high quality but lowerpaid talent catherine zetajones is a big name the other talent is lesser knowncost containment
3,not sure what to think i had great plans for this dress
3,the fabric is lovely color was great but unfortunately it ran a bit large this might be a case of girls with boobs vs girls without i have a small chest so for me this just didnt stay in place i was worried about the arms squeezing me so i got a small rather than my usual xs bad choice the diamond in the middle pooches out rather than hugging your body which was what i was hoping for when i raise my arms the whole shirt ends up riding up pretty awkward theres also a lot of fabric
3,display is very poor i am not satisfied with display i tried to return it but it has no return policy it has replacement policy only it has only gb space with apps
3,i ordered a small and im usually always a small i could not zip it up im am returning it for a large and this is concerning because what if it is big in a weird way because im usually a large
3,this card advertises itself as uhs but its actually uhsthis means that it will not go up to sdr speedsthroughputnot necessary bad just false advertising
3,while this top has a lovely design neckline and color the metalic threads made it too shimmery for me i actually think it looks better in pictures than in person because of the metallic threads
3,this dress did not work for me i tried it in my bigger size since i am coming off winter weight gain the dress fit tts but was squishing the breasts like tight bandages i have smaller chest and the stretch bodycon fabric of the bodice made me look flatchested the straps did not sit flat on shoulders i assume because they were not pulled tight enough by the chest the dress was uncomfortable and felt strange on but i can see how others with more curves on top will love the support of the
3,butthe problem is i cannot get the color to stay below the shoulders the large appeal of this top is the over the shoulder lookbut in just trying it on it would pop off the shoulders and make a cowl neck kind of top that didnt lay right if it would have stayed it would have been a real win for me i like the quality of the fabric and the longs sleeves but i cant get the desired look to work out so this is going back
3,good show last episode of season was clearly worse for some reason though the action scenes in the last episodes felt like terrible s action movies or such
3,love the style weight not too hot and look but it sheds all over any pants other than jeans i also wore a white tank under it and it stained it blue very disappointed
3,my nephews have been begging me to watch peaky blinders for three years now but i just didnt have the time i decided this past month that i would make a commitment to the first season man oh man was i pleased its the show that keeps on giving from an americans pov its like gangs of new york meets once upon a time in america i finished all six seasons and have been telling anyone who hasnt watched it yet to give it a go the acting is awesome although the accents are thick at times and i had to rewatch a few scenes to make sure i heard everything correctly the women are strong and dont take any shit cillian murphy is a tour de force my only complaint is the lack of recognition pb is getting from the award shows like the golden globes and emmys if you like this kind of tv crime violence history then give it a chance you wont be sorry
3,if you follow this recipe youll get a cake thats pretty dense the recipe has the right ingredients but the wrong steps for a fluffy cake only use a mixer to beat the eggs and sugar after that use a spatula to mix everything else in because if you continue to use a mixer youll beat out a lot of air bubbles from the mixture which will make it less fluffy also add the milk and butter before the flour because adding the flour first will make the mixture so dense that it will push out the air from the mixture if you prefer something less sweet use cups of sugar instead of you could also melt the butter first before stirring in the milk just to make it melt faster
3,i think the recipe is pretty good overall but unhappy with the noodles probably the brand because we usually like rice noodles
3,this is the perfect peplum it floats a bit but doesnt stick out and is super flattering thats why i kept mine even though the front seams were like an inch off and the peplum pleat is crooked geeze retailer this is why i cant justify buying much of anything unless its on sale quality in recent years has gone wayyyy downhill
3,season is just excellent loved everything about it music picture and the story the story from the very begging makes you uncomfortable cringe and its really entertaining i dont know any other series that entertain me in that way the guests of the hotel interact with each other and whats important they interact with the hotel staff as well the stories of the staff is a different theme you dont get any of what ive just mentioned in season the themes are flat and generic its just typical drama not to say a boring one i keep watching it only because i love the season so much
3,love this show i basically cry through every episode amazing acting on everyones part also so scary to think what if the world comes to this
3,very pretty top however you absolutely need to try it on before ordering fit well in the chest area but way too big in the sides i looked pregnant had to return
3,nice but heavy load not allowed this lap
3,this is a beautiful lined jacket with a much more structured fit than a typical kimono it hit me at the high hip not low hip as shown on the model given how structured it is i dont think the one size will work for anyone larger than a small if you want a drapey kimono fit
3,i just received this beautiful dress in the mail after ordering my usual size petite words cant describe how beautiful the fabric and embroidery appeared as i pulled the dress from the box i quickly tried it on the length was perfect but when i attempted to zip the side zipper i realized that i would never be able to zip it up over my size c chest the bodice is simply too small sadly i have to return the dress this is my biggest disappointment from retailer so far if you have a ver
3,looking at the other reviews no it is not bosch but that was totally written differently this a has a les serious but good written action acting and overall suspense it is reacher the character is different from bosch its much more fun
3,i love jennifer coolidge so i was excited to watch this show so far i dont know what to think about this series i really hate the two young girls i guess i will continue watching
3,i was so excited to see this yellow dress online but was disappointed with the color when it arrived the yellow us much darker than pictured i felt the dress ran true to size but if youre short you definitely want to go with petite sizes
3,no issues with laptop only issue with screen it flicker when low brightness usually we dim brightness in night so save money with tft display with same features
3,keypad backlight is not there but in other model with same specifications has keyboard backlight and its hang little bit
3,some people rate this less than star because they want sexual content more than a decent story they dont have their brain to use whats going on in the series
3,its really cute but seems expensive for the type of fabric i thought it would be more substantial got lots of compliments
3,only recommended for students or coders if youre looking for photo or video editing then dont go for it coz screen quality is not good
3,so much about this dress is wonderful the fabric is a nice weight the color is gorgeous i got this in the blue the length on the petite hits right above the knee unfortunately i got a p my usual size in antho dresses and the elastic waistband was on my boobs rather than under them ive got a sizable bust g so this happens from time to time im exchanging for a regular which hopefully will have a little more room but busty gals beware at least its not too low cut
3,andor is the most mature politically charged and narratively rich entry in the star wars universe to date that is exactly what makes it brilliant rather than relying on lightsabers or skywalker nostalgia andor focuses on the slowburning origins of rebellion through the eyes of cassian andor a morally conflicted thief turned revolutionary diego luna delivers a grounded understated performance that anchors the show but it is the supporting cast particularly genevieve oreillys formidable mon mothma and stellan skarsgårds shadowy luthen rael who elevate it into something operatic what sets andor apart is its trust in the audience it avoids fan service opting instead for longform storytelling character development and complex themes such as surveillance fascism and the price of freedom the writing is sharp the direction confident and nicholas britells score is hauntingly effective this is star wars for grownups less space wizardry and more orwellian tension it is not for everyone but for those tired of formulaic spinoffs andor is a revelation out of the rebellion begins not with a bang but with a whisper and andor makes that whisper unforgettable
3,i am a true to size and when this bathing suit arrived it looks like its a kids i will exchange for an and hope for the best the quality looks great and the styling is beautiful but i could barely get into the suit
3,looks like not everybody understands this dark humor comedy this show is brilliant i really felt like i was on vacation another great piece from hbo actingvisuals and music was on point
3,good structure and quality a bit large and wish i had ordered something a bit brighter i ordered the white tee
3,get it quickly packaging to protect the item in the package not top amazon the plush be it there should be more choices i dont find the otter to my liking but the choices offered are top so
3,when i read all these positive reviews i did not hesitated as i wanted good basics which will be good investment in me as looking good is always investment well i love blue color as i am blonde wih blue eyes and this color makes my eyes brighter and matches almost everything butthe design of the shirt is made oversize fit basically the shirt should not be dressed as fitted its more relaxed fit so if you wear medium go head and order medium even if the small fits unless you want to look lik
3,worked great in my galaxy suntil it didnt work at all for some unknown reason used it for about months before it crapped out back up your data with all these things though
3,i really wanted to love this everything about this piece especially after reading all of the great review i was so excited and looking forward to getting this dress unfortunately it just did not work out i ordered a large and it fit fine but the dress did not give me the faltering shape i had read about and was hoping for it literally just hung on me and made me look wider sadly i had to return this
3,i love the style and the look of this sweater i wanted to love it and keep it but could not because the itchiness was too much the style looks so comfortable and easy going but it was not it was clingy around the waist and backside for reference i am ft in and b and i ordered the small the sleeves were too long on me not cool long like some other sweaters this season
3,this is a beautiful top however it looks better on the pound model the shirt sits awkward on your chest if you have any cleavage and there is way too much fabric around the body if you are any size beyond a then it just makes you look bigger than you are
3,i bought these almost immediately after touching them in store they were so soft i didnt even need to try them on to know i would love them i now wish i had tried them on in the store so i could have learned that the elastic band on the inside isnt sown in meaning the band will constantly twist and get tangled whenever i put them ontake them off its unbelievably annoying i have to fix them every time i wear them if i had known this i dont know if i would have purchased them they are
3,battery backup is not good charged laptop use continuously only min
3,very first ten minutes or so of the very first episode the cowboy shoots a horse under the chin ok i decided to let that go then some wild stallion was backed out of a horse trailer im done sure would be nice to see movies and tv shows get the horse stuff right and believable but thats just normal in hollywood
3,reacher is a quality series that i look forward to continuing with season its has some genuinely funny moments and the additional action scenes are deliver really well the most pleasing aspect though is that its an adult show not sanitised for a younger audience it give the show more credibility
3,i have made a wacky choccake for years and this has similar ingredientsbut i question that this recipe has only c of flour not c likel theacky cakei have not baked this cake because of the flour discrepancyare you sure it is c flour for the liquid sugarand cocoa amount it does not seem proportional to the liquids
3,can the cup of oil be substituted with applesauce it seems like a lot of oil
3,battery drain fast display not up to the mark backlight kb is gooddelivery on time
3,i didnt plan to wear this off shoulder sadly the neck is too loose and big if worn on shoulder the fabric is nice i liked the vintage looking design thats black with purple flowers the body has a lot of fabric and although i ordered size large i would size down to a medium if i were to reorder dont think i will though
3,my firned tried this on and her first comment was take it off it is scratchy so i didnt bother trying it on it is however beautiful if you are not sensitive to scratchy material fit was true to size
3,in the picture it looked to be a structured blazer but when i tired it on i got an extra small and it was too big
3,i havent bin a big fan of season and even the writers of season made some fun of that but holy moly season is so much better the narration is linear without time jumps the characters reveal themselves much better the battle scenes are gorgeous and vast and the monsters look just awesome of course many scenes from the books are changed in their own way but in many situations this only makes them richer i watched the first episode with great apprehension i think those who saw it will understand me but further all episodes in one go i want more and want it now
3,i fell in love with this dress the instant i saw it but was disappointed when i received it first was the color i chose the green and it wasnt what i thought it was a very unnatural shade of artificial grass when my husband saw it in the package he thought i had ordered a cheap grass hula skirt the color was that bad the fit was the next problem this dress would have fit nicely if they had just added a side zip and made the top more fitted the top was loose and that added to the flowy
3,cute pants not for me a petite size may have changed my mind more like ankle pants on my frame and a bit large all over that said the fabric is stretchy and they would be super comfortable love the snaps on the waistband classy casual
3,like the product no give any gift item
3,despite other reviewers comments on size i really wanted this one to work so i ordered it im typically a size xs and d chest and instead i ordered a small the body of the sit for well but the cups of the suit id said for more for a b if i lifted my arms i would literally come out of it
3,inspite of i th gen its a little slow apps take time to open
3,the collar on this sweater is too stiff for my taste the color and fabric is really nice just wish the collar was different
3,the handmaids tale is a tv series i was very late to the party with but i did binge it last year in preparation for the final season and it was awesome now that the show has just ended i can still say that this show was awesome positives for the handmaids tale the premise of this show is very dark chilling and gripping about this classbased society where things are pretty messed up for some of the people especially the women and while it was hard to grasp at first i did get used to this shows tone and approach i like how everyone has to follows these rules and go by what is required of them or else things will end badly for them and it makes you afraid for our characters as they try to break free from this society the cast does an excellent job with their acting in the show including elisabeth moss joseph fiennes yvonne strahovski alexis bledel madeline brewer ann dowd ot fagbenle max minghella samira wiley amanda brugel bradley whitford sam jaeger and ever carradine the show is very slowpaced with its storytelling and it engulfs you into this environment that makes you feel dirty and uncomfortable but in the best way possible the writing in this show is fantastic and it hits all of the right notes when it needs to during certain scenes the show does have some missteps with a number of episodes but not enough to derail the momentum of the show season are perfect seasons of television while season are great with some small mistakes in there however i did find all seasons to be very engaging with the characters and the storylines and finally i really enjoyed the finale and it felt like the right note to end the show on overall the handmaids tale was a fantastic show on hulu and i would recommend this show to everyone so that they can experience it once
3,i enjoyed the first season of reacher i was not attracted to the show at first due to the meathead musclebound lead but i was wrong its a good show very predictable like an s series or action movie but not in a bad wayand certainly not fully cheesy like the s it has a small amount cheese but not enough to make you roll your eyes it has some heart and a good amount of action alan ritchson jack reacher reminds me of patrick warburton in a way hes not the best actor but hes not the worst all in all i quite enjoyed reacher and i recommend it to anyone looking to kill hours in a pleasant way
3,after month battery and performance is average and im facing lagging problem which is too irritating
3,for starters the back pictured on the website is not true to the actual back of the shirt the small traps are not there and it isnt gathered in the exact same way the big bow is adjustable and overall i really loved the fit of the top but the difference in design is not something i would expect from retailer my shirt also got a hole in it along the seam in the back after washing once although i liked the look of the top the quality is not what im used to from retailer
3,i wanted to like this romper it is very cute and colorful but to top was overywhelming for my size and made me look even shorter
3,i am curvy and this top while stylish and i love the pockets just didnt do it for me it made my shoulders look wider than they are which is a big no no it would probably look better on someone with smaller shoulders or slimmer the wool was also a tad itchy not too itchy just a bit in general i dont wear wool without cashmere i also dont wear nonitalian wool because it is a bit rough and my skin reacts to it so i stick to wool cashmere blend or loro piana soft wool this sweater s
3,this review is after days use i oled screen is fabulous punchy colors good brightness overall great display ii lookwise i would say ok ok not so good looking not so bad either it is fine iii performance wise it is good it handles day to days tasks easily i use it for office use only word excel pdf etc for these it is buttery smooth i have not any game on it or havent done heavy tasks on it than can test its limits so for my office use it is smooth iv battery howev read more
3,i ended up returning it just because it didnt do much for my current postnatal figure but otherwise this top is just so pretty and unique
3,one of the greatest plots and scenarios you could ever see its so good and enjoyable and intense watch it now
3,watched the first hour of the first episode so far i like what i see i never played the first game played the second id give that game an so i missed the backstory behind joel and ellie but i can say i agree with how the first hour played out in regards to a real world outbreak the first scene with the runners looked good the way they run and act along with them being clumsy etc is true to the game havent seen them yet but the previews showing the clickers looked good too we shall see im wondering if they are gonna have the other ones from the game this season i wouldnt be surprised if they didnt save it for the next one i think if they keep wokeism away from the show it will be good so far a id say
3,the only problem is overheating otherwise this is a very good option at this price
3,for some reason the cream colored cords are sheer the material is quite thin you can see the pockets through them as well as the seams i have other ag cords and it seems the material they are using this go around is substandard too bad
3,battery backup was soo soo sooo worst and its draining very fast this laptop always use with plugin socket and sometimes i feel whether i purchased laptop or desktop display also having very low brightness performance was average overall it is a not bad and not good product i think realme laptops are more better than this laptop
3,absolutely love the print and quality is great too unfortunately for a well endowed woman like myself it runs terribly small in the bust and hip region it absolutely does not look as flowy on an hourglass body type too bad because its beautiful might try sizing up but doubt it will work
3,ive been drinking this tea for a long time this latest delivery tastes different i dont like the taste at all i thought i was going off tea but having changed to a different tea its still my favourite drink
3,good product
3,this is a great dress nice soft fabric and the red is a nice vibrant tomato red color i ordered a small i am and usually wear a in dressed this dress was so huge it might be mismarked but labeled a small i will have to return it not even my seamstress can make it fit
3,a very simple story with kind of normal people problems great acting and now and them good surprises the manager going down in the ass of an employee was very funny
3,cute but didnt realize it was sweatshirt material due to that returning
3,i am giving feedback after month using this laptop is best in this pricebest battery backup little bit fan sound but still running good
3,stays true to the character and the books great perfect actor for the starring roll and a great supporting cast already cant wait until season
3,good product but delivery too late wehne we will follow up by mail
3,i purchased this sweater because of the cute unique diagonal design however i was largely disappointed by the fiber of the sweater it is rather coarse to the touch and a bad fit on the model it looks nice but it was large around the torso yet short at the same time creating an awkward and unflattering fit i shall be returning it
3,very cute coat but could not keep it for the pricejust not sure it is worth almost with tax added to cost when it goes on sale i will most likely buy it
3,gorgeous but just too short in length for anyone with a long torso i sized up to get more length but then the neck opening was way too big and hung open to expose well everything up top wearing a cami would be an option but would take away from the dressiness of the top i had to leave without this item but was disappointed because i love the colors and cut otherwise
3,i am very pleased with this version of reacher the back story gave lots of info on who he was and why while the movies we very good i would have loved him in the original while the professional critic may have an opinion i did not agree with them i cant wait for the next installment i binged the first season and hope not to wait forever for the next
3,these were very nice but had to return i have a hard time with jeans as i am big and curvy in hips and butt these were tight in those places and big in the waist
3,off to an amazing start well acted well cast incredibly beautiful to look at in hdr could be a massive hit and hopefully be around for many years
3,at start it might appear boring but you will fall in love with the peaky blinders as u keep watching dont just judge the whole series based on the lag just keep yours thoughts aside and immense yourself into this amazing series
3,i loved this series from the first episode so intriguing i would love to see more i feel like i can relate to wednesdays character so much which makes me enjoy it even more bingewatched it and now i cant wait for a new season it had just the right amount of everything i began to watch it due to me being a big fan of jenna ortega she was the perfect choice for this and no one couldve done it better each episode left me wanting to watch more i do recommend this for people of ages between in my experience with older adults i believe they would not enjoy it as much but should still give it a try once again hoping to see more season whenn
3,just an ok recipe to me a rather heavy bread not light like most of my quick bread recipes are also way too many nuts for my taste will return to my go to banana nut recipe
3,purchased the gray patterned top seemed to fit tts but it didnt fit me im an athletic build with a d bust and it just wouldnt fit right around the shoulderneck area im pretty confident it would fit someone who is less busty than i the doublesided fabric was soft and felt like it would washwear very well nice length all aroundtop and sleeves
3,the show is very good and adapts well to the books and game people are just haters when they brought up got just enjoy the show and have fun with it
3,this dress needs such a specific body type but thats not to say it isnt for everyone this dress is lovely but its a dress that you need to try on in multiple sizes to figure out which will fit i tried this in three different sizes to find the fit it was supposed to be i had to size up and go to petite size i do vary between and and this one i ended up getting an p this dress is lovely but it is a trial and error dress so dont get discouraged if you have to size up it will look love
3,all specifications are good at this price but speaker quality is below the average
3,this show has been damaging my mental health since its about time this is coming to an end back then i was watching it during the morning commute on a mobile device and showed up to work like a right mess it is certainly one of the emotionally most powerful shows ever created i dont think i ever felt that level of anger and hate in a real life situation the show is a masterpiece in actor close ups with digital focal depth and overthetop colour grading by season this feels dated i have slight chest pains in every single scene that elizabeth moss appears in i cannot cope with that stare and to be frank once this show is finished i dont want to see her and her penetrating scientology eyes ever again the only relief are the hilarious bradley whitford and occasionally max minghella whenever he lights a cigarette in his constant fml moments a show i will remember as one of the best it was worth the pain but one i would never recommend to anyone else
3,everything is working fine battery sometimes showing hours backup sometimes hoursand backlit keyboard is missing
3,cute sweater i really like the grey color unfortunately it was boxy and a little short on me almost worth keeping but even with a tshirt underneath i wanted to scratch my skin off its very itchy mine is going back
3,the hinge is too tight and it will open mm automatically after close
3,i ordered a size my usual size is a or the tunic fit well through the torso but the arm length was too short and hit just below the elbow the sleeve interfered with arm bending and moving i have petite proportions so the arm length of regular size garments is usually too long i dont want to go up in size because the body of the tunic might be too roomy
3,the lining is shorter than the top so i keep pulling it down also the finishing of the edges looks like a child cut it with some scissors it is not evenly cut i do like the color and style of the shirt just not the quality
3,even though it says my review is for the gb version its for the gb not sure why it says gb abovei received this card to use in my macbook air for extra storage i liked that the speeds were up to mbs i figured there would be a little bit of a fudge factor but not this muchwhile i can consistently get almost mbs read speeds the write speeds were only around mbsi guess you could average these together but i dont think thats really the point i didnt see a review that dealt with this specifically so hopefully this will help someone else out in the futureupdate only now did i go back and read the tiny print that write speeds may be slower well that is obvious now but i think of the speed is a lot slower
3,atwoods efforts are honored here i imagine that anything i might say would sound feminist which of course is a bad word for anyone who doesnt believe that females should have the same rights and privileges as males actually many who believe in the ideals of feminism still refuse to be associated with that word imagine how bored and indifferent someone who cant handle a word that represents more than half the worlds population might be if they had to lower themselves to watch this amazing spoton television show about how the other half lives and has lived for thousands of years and were the weaker sex
3,i like the recipe but i think it is too moist i made it with large bananas and felt it was going to be like soup i added a cup extra flour and it was still a little too moist for me but my guests said it was very good and didnt know it was gf also i mixed the nuts in
3,good but didnt think it was as great as the reviews made it out to be probably would have liked it better with less sour cream taste was easy to make
3,i thought every app could be transferred into the sd card but no the description said that i would speed up the device a little but i think it got slower i have samsung device and its not faster at all and not improving it also i love this sd card i realy do recommend it but there are some pitty partsnto it still love it
3,good but not best for value of money
3,very rich and sweet corn for a dessert
3,there is a known issue with a batch of these cards where they can completely die this is known defect affecting a lot of galaxy s and note users so if your card dies either exchange through amazon or contact sandisk for a replacement newer cards are supposedly fixed but you might want to back up your data just in case mine were purchased in november and both have now failed in separate phones unreadable by pcs or phones
3,i am passed that this show is over already anyone who doesnt like to watch this show can tune it out its dallas on steroids i live in north idaho and i cant get enough of this show
3,it is very hard to make me watch a series about teenagers specially those with some kind of power however wednseday has that atmosphere that brings you towards making the first step of start watching it the series itself was good as the mystery keeps you interested enough to watch the next episode moreover the cinematography is excellent and this is not something weird as netflix products always have such a quality even through most of them turns to be max lol finally i dont have to say how good the actress performance here a good show to spend some enjoyable time season i dont believe it is needed but might not be a bad idea eventually
3,i bought the blue dress though the blue dress was a little more like grey according to my husband and i the quality of the fabric was quite nice i have to return the dress because it does not fit me around the bust i consider myself to have a good size bust not huge but the dress seems to expect quite a bit smaller i was initially attracted to the dress because it looked a little more casual which is what i wanted but i guess i just wouldnt call it at all pretty
3,i went in knowing nothing about the show and i was quite surprised of how good it turned out a small series consisting of only episodes each lasting minutes it isnt overly long and it uses the time it is given greatly to develop its big cast of characters honestly i wouldnt be able to name most of the people in the show what i remember are more their personality traits and the plot of the show the characters are a bit shallow as you will most likely just remember theyre traits it isnt hard to follow the plot and you just watch as an outsider how the scenarios and characters slowly descent into madness overall the humor actually works great and i feel like there is something for everyone the show does a great job at balancing the dark and humorous tones the music is pretty good at illustrating this point but it does use its main theme a too much blasting the music every time theres a montage or it needs to illustrate the insanity of the situation overall its a good show with some good performances all around while nothing to write home about the music is too in your face and it can feel a bit boring for at times as theyre just talking and doing mundane vacation activities also a second season is set to launch in and i think i might tune in depending
3,after about three months of usage the only issue i have is the excessive heating and the very low battery life but design and performance is very
3,i played the game and truly enjoyed most of the gameplay excepting the stealth only sections but always felt like the plot was just kinda well misery porn and wasnt drawn to that cut to the show coming out i wasnt sure id like it because i expected more misery porn but my wife wanted to see it so i joined her episodes and are pretty good but episode three shocked me with how good it was its a beautiful depiction of love in a time of savagery and government repression i dont know if the rest of the show will turn out to be terrible but this episode will always be one of the best ive ever seen of any show ever if you never watch another episode of the show watch this one
3,the center of my loaf wasnt completely cooked until hour minutes even though i foiled the edges my loaf still turned out very dark with a slight burnt flavor nonetheless the bread remained moist i substituted raisins with chocolate chips not terribly impressed with this recipe
3,question how does the baking instructions change after you freeze the pie
3,im using ofter days but ok
3,tim never fails to impress and i just couldnt get enough of wednesday ill be waiting and praying for a second season for sure thank you tim for the best show of you really checked all the boxes with this one no spoilers here but if youre into dark comedys this is the show for you left me on the edge of my seat and wanting more from the first episode to the last i never write reviews but this one was worth taking the time to give a i havent been impressed by much the last two years show wise but this was as i said superb gratitude is all i have thank you thank you thank you
4,the makers of the show seem to have completely forgotten what make the first two seasons of this show special while on the surface it appears like more of the same really it has lost everything that made it great just watch the first two seasons and stop after that the spark and humour and intelligence in writing of the first two seasons is just completely gone whats left just feels an empty dreary slog youre just waiting for it to finally go somewhere whereas the first two seasons were so much more entertaining and interesting along the way and really the plot and final twist was never what it was about
4,this suit is well made and is so darn cute i usually wear a but i am a size in this us size although the main tag is australian size they send out based on the us size ordered the only issue i have is that i have a longish torso compared to my size so its ever so slightly tight in the crotch but not enough to make me send it back i have small boobs so the extra padding is nice im and athletic and lbs
4,i ordered this top in the pink in a medium i usually wear a small or medium in retailer shirts it fit tts with not being too short the embrodiery is very pretty better in person than online my only complaint is its a bit blousey so you would need to either tuck it in or wear with skinny jeansshorts for reference i am lbs and a c
4,loved this tee but embroidery started to unravel even before being washed i paid full price for this top and wasnt disappointed but needed to return due to the embroidery problem this tee is a mustard color
4,this laptop is quite good for who is looking a hp laptop i in budget of k the display is good but the problem is it is getting hot at the time of charging and the battery backup is about hrs at normal web browsing
4,a successful series with an interesting and complex story the characters were small but well designed i was expecting more fights from geralt but it was still good as a series modeled on the game series it was a success and met expectations each episode follows a good story and each episode is a challenge
4,i havent tried it yet but wonder how the amish prepared potatoes for it im sure they didnt use frozen hash browns
4,jenna ortega as wednesday is absolutely amazing it feels like she was born for this character she is by far one of my favorites actresses of this generation the supportive cast is also really good you feel for some of this characters my favourites in this show enid and of course thing you dont need to know all about the adams just knowing a little bit about them is all you need this show is all about wednesday with of course small cameos from other members of the family the big reveal at the end felt a little bit predictable for me but the conclusion is really well executed overall i think people should give this show a chance i promise you is an amazing ride
4,the cotton silk blend fabric is beautiful and breathes well i wouldnt have given this dress a thought based on the online pics but in person i found it femine pretty and comfortable for an outdoor garden party im attending it isnt too short when i sit or bend over and with some funky colorful jewelry i really liked it i enjoy the slightly puffy gathered shoulder i did size down so the dress wouldnt be too blowzy but mostly bc i wanted a tighter fit and it still hides my belly
4,i bought this during the off and im glad i did the sweater does run large so i would recommend sizing down im lbs with a larger bust d and even the size small is large on me not large enough to exchange but i would probably do better with an xs even with an xs i would still get that oversized look the color is not exactly as pictured it is a brighter yellow in person i was expecting more of a muted soft baby yellow and thats not exactly what this is some pros a
4,ive worn this shirt approx times to work each time someone comments on how much they like it im attempting to add more color to my workwear this shirt tends to swing so much i feel exposed that is the biggest drawback
4,got this at k overall nice product but display and speaker disappoints a little but overall happy with the p
4,my only reservation is that i wish the tail wasnt so much longer than the front i returned it reluctantly because i needed something just a little dressier for the occasion
4,i am a long time jack reacher fan and its an absolute delight to say that the series is very much true to its source material something i rarely see nowadays obviously this wont reinvent the action thriller wheel but its pretty decent and awesome television with great casting acting and dialogues for the short span it lasts it absolutely deserves your time
4,very easy and quite filling its the perfect chili for autumnwinter
4,just ok display performance battery camera
4,i purchased of these for my htc incredible phone and the other for use in a key chain storage device both of these cards run very very hot after copying over gb of files it was almost scalding to the touch but both have been reliable with only a few issues of reading them both times in the thumb drive adapter so that may have been at fault and not the card itself
4,so ive read through some of these reviews and the clowns leaving star saying its a game of thrones knockoff havent seen the episodes i wont mention any spoilers but holy smokes that fight scene in episode the plot overall is mind blowing
4,every thing is nice and clean ryzen u provide beast performance while doing heavy tasks in power bi premiereps ms office is cheery on top for students the only problem is there is no backlit keyboard or else its pretty good you should go for it if you find it near k
4,the best part of star wars universo the last episode ends the season with great scenes
4,this laptop is good for normal work programming or moderate gaming but now for very high performancethe build quality of laptop is very nice would feel like you are holding macbook the sound quality is normal didnt meet the expectation display quality is also good but brightness may disappoint you does not look like nits the battery backup is perfect it comes with ctype charging port which supports thunderbolt cable good reason for me to buy this laptop
4,for reference athleticmuscular body type broad shoulders slim hips i wanted to love this dress soooo much i wanted it for holidays and special occasions but my broad shoulders and d chest worked against me the crisscrossed bodice accentuated my larger top and there wasnt enough poof in the skirt to balance me out im sure this will work beautifully on other body types and i wish it worked on mine too a sparkly necklace or dangling earrings and a high bun are all you
4,overall
4,this is a cool fun sweater but beware of sizing i started out with a small which looked like i was wearing a childs sweater i ended up with a large which fits fine but is by no means generous to get the look of the model id need to be in at least an xl
4,this was way better than i expected it to be tts and flattering the material on the top section is on the thinner side but is very soft and comfortable the skirt section is a little on the shorter side for me but with tights i think i could still make it wearable for work
4,really enjoy this pullovers arm detail i got the purple which was somewhere between aubergine and garnet i think this will easily go with black pants to wear to work or a fun skirtjeans
4,i was so excited about this dress but when i got it there were several issues i had with it the neck is just too high for me and the skirt is too pleated and makes my hips look wide i was hoping for more of an aline cut gorgeous though wish it worked
4,amazing performance and video quality is osm in this price
4,i made this bread different times once i didnt realize that my yeast was no longer active and ended up with a very dose loaf but my kids still loved it even i did then i made the second round with an active yeast and it was much better my youngest while having his first couple bites send to me mom this is the best bread seriously oh my gosh you should be a chef hahahaha i totally took credit too lol thanks for this easy recipe definitely a winner around my place
4,love this dress just wore it last night to an early valentines dinner very classy simple but gorgeous im a size in just about everything but i always buy a size in retailer dresses because im tall and have broad shoulders and a long torso and sizing up in dresses works better all around i am also not busty b i did get this in a this dress was a little awkward at first trying to hook and then zip but once i got that down it worked the hook is right up under your
4,if one can see one thing in todays times it is that people tend to exaggerate something is either terrible or brilliant the same applies here the fanboys and girls cheer the realization of an epic computer game as if this production would redefine the genre there are no innovations to be seen here of course the effects and production design are very good and true to the original the story is told in an exciting way but you have to make compromises when it comes to the cast for the role of joel i couldnt think of anyone better than pedro pascal chapeau but ellie sorry bella ramsey just doesnt fit at all to portray this ambiguous personality on the one hand tender and on the other brave and selfsacrificing shes more like the elephant in the china shop after two episodes it is of course too early to give a final rating of a series in this respect we are eagerly awaiting what the last of us will offer us in terms of hopefully enjoyable entertainment
4,whoa these are very highwaisted but i think i like it this is a very s style with the high waist and wide legs the brown motif is kinda funky i am a svintage lover though so i was pleasantly surprised the tall length is more than adequately long for my frame i may need to take them up a little bit in fact
4,good laptop for many midrange activities
4,im an xl in retailer tops and the xl in this blouse fit nicely tops from tiny can sometimes be really tiny but this blouse is cut correctly for its size im full figured and busty and the xl fit comfortably if youre athletic or have a petite bust or are slender you might be able to size down the neckline is really beautiful and unique and the shirt material is soft the front is a very pale lavender and the sleeves and back of the blouse are gray there is a pale lavender lining fo
4,this is a very tasty recipe i agree with the previous poster make sure you use the amount of meat or it will be salty there has been times where i omitted the italian dressing just using the gravy mix and the ranch dressing is still very flavorful
4,i sized up to my higher size choice and it was snug not for athletic builds top was fitted and thighs tight which caused the belly area to pouf out good for very thin gals also good if you are long waisted
4,almost okay
4,this is the best drama i ever looked i just cant wait for next season everything is excellent and i think that no one would play role of thomas shelby better than cillian murphy he is absolutely stunning the hole story make your addiction groves with every new season steven knight is a certainly one of the greatest producers of our age i watched all most every movie and show he ever made but this is a masterpiece however thank bbc for this amazing and brilliant show impatiently waiting for season
4,good for minimum use
4,i really liked this top but it was very expensive even when on sale and it ended up being boxy i am flatchested a if i remember correctly i tried on the xs it was cute but it wasnt flattering because it was so boxy on my frame perhaps itd be more flattering on other body shapes i think it would be cuter if it was a bit more fitted otherwise the quality seemed great though id be worried about all the beading falling off eventually
4,pretty good my family of four including one kid who does not like asian food really liked this i did not have sesame oil and i used more soy sauce and ground ginger than the recipe called for very flavorful we all added chinese mustard and more soy sauce when eating i will definitely make this recipe again but ill be buying preshredded cabbage to save time to make this a super quick and easy weeknight dinner
4,nice deal
4,my rating of is an average of a out of for season one and out of for season two season one is unnecessarily dark leveraging cliche current issues and topics to essentially make you dislike the entire cast and regret watching the entire season steve zahn is still fantastic conversely season maintains a much better balance of dark humor and intrigue that makes each episode enjoyable and compels you to want to find out what happened to the body you finish watching season and can let out a flabbergasted laugh of things gone sideways yet not disheartening like in season one f murray abraham does an amazing job in season consistently bringing his offbeat character to each scene
4,went in to this not having any real expectations from the way star wars has been doing in the past years but i have to say i was hooked from the first minute to the last unfortunately the episodes are very much on the short side but on the other hand i never got the feeling that it was rushed in any part which considering the length of the episodes and all that is going on is a feat on itself i have absolutely nothing bad to say about the show if the movies had the feel of this show they would be a huge hit with the star wars fans at least the ones that are out of puberty unfortunately this show is all we have for the time being i want more and i want it as soon as possible
4,nice product great performance when plugged in but a small lag when on battery everything is good but the flipkart packaging is bad no padding provided just shipped in a box cover
4,volue for money nice
4,i bought this in the faded pink rose color which is inexplicably called red motif and it is very comfortable yet not so stretchy as to fall off i did size down from to there is a bit of puckering of the front placket but i believe based on my history with pilcro that there will be enough stretching out to even out that puckering i wish there were pockets though i can see it may be a design decision i love the faded inbetween color but the other colors are great and i can see gett
4,amazing product from hp value for money
4,it was hard for me to rate how this was sizedit is tight through the bust very baggy and boxy through the body and short looked gorgeous on the hanger though
4,this top is very airly and swingy definitely need to wear skinny jeans to off set the volume on top it is a pretty top and also unique so i kept it
4,kinda hard to review this show on one hand this is classic fun with a big muscular hero riding into town saving people beating up the bad guys and being all that you can be on the other hand this is also both cliche and very simple no one can seriously state this show is wellmade brilliance nor can it be said this is realistic sure it is fun seeing our hero and his band of compadres kicking behinds and taking names but i also keep rolling my eyes at the over the top nonsense and unrealistic bravado the acting is mostly great and storytelling is okay the entertainment value is very high you will not be bored watching this show if you enjoy watching disposable henchmen and cliche villains getting beaten up in droves by a hulky hero with cliche dialogue than this is the show for you if you however want quality some resemblance of realism and excellent writing well than this is probably not for you i do like this as said this is entertaining and if you want to sit back relax eat some popcorn and just enjoy action this is pretty much as good as it can be on tv but the lack of creativity and atrocious dialogue bothers me too much to really be a fan i give this a in todays tv world this is one of the better ones sadly and i do recommend
4,delicious easy i am going to try a pet ritz pie shell this next time i did cook the pie a little longer then suggested as i wasnt sure how the center of the pie should be before taking it out any suggestions
4,love the overall design especially the tie on the back i know it will become a favorite i do wish it were a tad longer though
4,no spoilers ive waited until the first season is over to arrange my thoughts ive been a star wars fan since my childhood as a millenal im that liking the prequels type the debut of the first episode was my turning point towards star wars i w
4,just picked this up in black in the store on the hanger it looks like just another vneck tank but it is quite flattering on however the vneck is quite exaggerated and loose i will be pinning it so it doesnt sag open
4,im and got the m i thought id need the petite but i decided to try on the regular m in the store and the length was fine mid calf i gave a for quality though because all the ones in my store were tearing in the back where the shoulders meet the back i bought it anyway because it looked like an easy fix and it was so darn cute and comfortable on

4,i like that
4,i never played this and second game i knew a little bit of the story since its hard to avoid after all theese years but i never watched cutscenes or etc i have to say that i loved it after watching first episode yes its only first episode but i have a feeling that this show wont dissapoint it looks very good high production value watched first mins of gameplay and saw that it is from the game as a person who never played the game i loved it but i understand if a person who played the game didnt like it so much cause its almost like playing the game again but then again people would complain that its not faithfull to games i would like netflix release model on this one would binge it in evenings
4,i wanted the blight yellow as photo with navy flower motifs however it was much more darker as on the tag mustard if you like its color you will like it

4,good value for money product
4,i love my blue dress im a pear shape to the top fit fine on me i know reviewers complained that the top was too tight not so on me it was also not sheer on me because it has a cotton lining underneath got a lot of compliments
4,i substituted leeks mostly the white parts for the onion unsalted chicken broth for the bullion and added salt to taste this is a great recipe thanks for sharing
4,nice experience with mac
4,this toner is great for every skin type in my opinion the product is in a plastic bottle which is very travel friendly my only downside with this is that its just a hole to pour out of and i often end up using too much good thing about it is that there is no alcohol in it at all also no artificial perfumes or colours just natural which is best for the skin this review was collected as part of a promotion
4,this skirt is gorgeous the picture doesnt do it justice it has beautiful sparkle and glitter in the material i received tons of compliments on it the biggest downside is the material it seems to snag and pull so easily in a short hours of wearing it the material was already pulled in two different places i will keep the skirt because it is so pretty but have to not get upset when the material gets worse over time
4,just made these today had to use two x square baking pans baked for minutes turned out beautifully think i will cut the frosting recipe in half to save on calories and sweetness next time gets two thumbs up on deliciousness
4,good product but backlit not avalabl
4,andor is why i pay my disney subscription this is star wars for those who have grown up with the franchise and are yearning for a more mature take on the universe its hard to use the work realistic when it comes to scifi but everything about andor feels real the characters act sensibly and their actions never feel like they are purely made to drive the plot forward i think the last time i used the term scifi that transcends its boundary was when talking about battlestar galactica i think i can safely use that term here too its not a action scifi so its audience it probably smaller so i hope it will not get cancelled i hope disney can find the courage to front a show based on quality and not just audience numbers i believe that quality shows will always be good revenue earners over time as they are appreciated by more people even if they are not the most popular out of the box
4,loved this from the minute i saw it great quality very heavy denim which i like does run small went up a size to be safe happy with the purchase
4,this is a quick amp tasty recipe not sure where the other readers saltiness was from unless it was from too salty a salsa or from the cheese as there is no added salt here
4,i only watched the first episode of wednesday and feel uncertain about continuing with the series the music and special effects are amazing as well as the actress who plays wednesday the huge downfall is that in the series wednesday and the addams family are seen as mean spirited that is not how the original series was at all in the original series the addams family the family loved being weird and could not understand why a normal society seen as strange to the family could not accept them they still loved each other and were kind and considerate to each other the pairings of john astin and carolyn jones as gomez and mortica along with ken weatherwax as pugsley and lisa loring as wednesday showed a family that loved and cared about each other who all liked to do strange things but they almost never had evil intent to hurt others in contrast they would feel puzzled about why a visitors behavior in their home would feel strange to them to the addams family they saw their world as perfectly normal but very rarely would they act or react with threats of violence unless a visitor was really a threat to them however the netflix series wednesday tries to compensate the flawed premise of wednesday addams being evil by using great music and special effects the result is brilliant cgi animation and music but this cant save the flawed characterization of wednesday as meanspirited when the real wednesday addams was not fans of the classic s show may want to stick with the original series for these reasons
4,one of the greatest shows i have ever watched like dallas meets the sopranos i hope this series never ends this is a must watch show and will become a cult classic
4,reference a ordered size xs the suit is pretty under the neckline where the two orange panels meet the white center panel that corner puckers a bit this will not happen if you have a larger chest than my a or have a longerbroader torso so that the fabric can stretch out thus pulling that merging area flat the sides cut out lays flat when you stand up straight and gapes when your turnbend to the side i think this is expected the bottom section on the back c
4,i tried this on in store after falling in love with it on the rack the dress is beautifully designed and has elegant subtle features i am normally a in retailer dresses but the was the closest fit on me unfortunately this dress fit very strangely the waist on the dress was way above my actual waist which was unusual given i have a very short torso it also had a strange fold right around my belly button which was very distracting ill put this all down to my extremely straight and
4,this is the reacher ive been waiting for has the look and attitude tom cruise just couldnt have not true to the books still a good show ive thoroughly enjoyed it
4,easy and quick i think gr turkey could easily replace the beef easy stand by meal
4,hp is my favorite overall good package
4,this dress is flattering but size up tight through chest in my normal size
4,gorgeous embroidering and feel very soft for wool this is a lot lighter than more jackets but with good layering can be worn in the winter im ft tall and lbs curvy and hourglass this hugs my curves beautifully in a size small and gives me a feminine shape it runs up to my knees and the sleeves are a bit long which will be hemmed soon i wanted the petite but it was sold out honestly this is perfect minus the arms the quality is gorgeous so soft and inviting to wear it runs la
4,this was a yummy moist cake the frosting threw me a bit i think i will use cream cheese in it next time overall good easy to follow recipe the turns outs beautifully
4,i found this skirt ran very small and i had to go up a size from what i usually wear maybe it is meant to be worn really tight as the fabric seems to contain a lot of spandex i really like the longer length it feels like a good sturdy fabric i havent washed it yet but im hoping it doesnt fade or shrink
4,i really enjoyed how luxurious this shower gel by simple felt on my skin fresh scent that kept me feeling really clean and confident and no nasty chemicals to worry about my children could use this too this review was collected as part of a promotion
4,i got these in kelly green because i am tired of all of the black and navy in my wardrobe and i was not disappointed the pants are welldesigned and drape well unlike a previous reviewer i did not find the fabric to be cheap but it is light and a little blousynot bad for a warm region like mine this polyester fabric has two advantages no fading and no wrinkles a good staple for work
4,this is a great basic tee purchased in navy but fits much larger than it appears on the model the armschest area fit fine but it really billows out below the front is shorter and the back is longer than i wouldve expected i thought this would be great for summer but its really too long in the back to wear with shorts it does however look great with skinny jeans
4,i had to use cheesewhiz and it seems to work well my family enjoyed it
4,heard this was good and finally got to watch it and amazingly it more then lived up to the hype fantastic creepy thought provoking brutal horrifying with excellent story ok few things dont fully make sense and acting all filmed in an eerie stylistic way that hitchcock or kubrick would be proud of if u havent seen this yet sit back and do so soon
4,this was a gift for a bachelorette very pretty and sexy without being too over the top love the print
4,my husband bought this for my birthday i love that it can be dressed up or worn for a more fun occasion im a tad small up top so it fits a little too loose up there but other than that it fits great im considering getting it altered just because i love it so much
4,im going with for stars only because these turn out more of a pan bread or cake not bars amazing flavor in the cake and icing
4,very long so may need to hem if your inseam is under beautiful trousers
4,cool product
4,i bought the mosaic pattern in a small the pattern and colors look much better in person the design and quality are solid the top runs small it is difficult to put on but stays in place i would recommend
4,the design of this top and colors are amazing the only complaint i have is that it is quite large i should have sized down needless to say i kept it as a summer to fall transition piece
4,cute jeans but they hit me a little higher on the calf than i would like so sadly i will be returning them
4,asus rog ally z non extreme is worth of money even play pc games in medium settings in our hand display is gorgeous and hz refresh rate buttery smooth
4,it looks a little more dressy in the picture but its cotton soft and very comfortable
4,i am giving this eight stars as this is another mike white series and they take a while to build enlightened definitely got better as it went along jake lacy and wife alexandra daddario are a great pairing at being a bad romantic pairing nice to see the great steve zahn back in something as well jennifer coolidge is hitting another high water mark as a clearly disturbed woman love the setting and music as well great summer series love i
4,i just finished episode and im hooked for those that will compare this to game of thrones please stop yes this is a sword and sorcery show as was game but give the writers some credit they didnt copy got or rip it off in any way they have created a beautiful stand alone sword and sorcery show that has every thing that a fan of this genre can ask for knights kings and queens magic monsters fighting sex nudity humor but not so much that you dont take it seriously henry cavill is great as the witcher i am a fan of his anyways superman of course but loved him a lot in mi fallout great baddy for ethan hunt to take on and for those that want to call this a poor mans got please dont do that netflix has spent a lot of money on this show and it is apparent the acting the effects the production value the great writing wipe thoughts of got right out of your mind and let this stand alone in your mind as it should comparing the two only makes you want things that will never happen because they are not copying got they have made a wonderful sword and sorcery show that is every bit of the imdb rating that is posted as of today for those that knock it below that what is your problem dont be haters if you were got fans and think its a knock off or ripoff just open your mind and let this show carry you away you will love it i do and i am a big fan of got i frigging loved that show but i already love this show and i suspect i wont be disappointed as i continue towards episode and sadly the end of the line for season one please release season quick
4,keeping the washing machine going
4,cute shirt nice for layering
4,have had many compliments on this tee feels dressed up without feeling too fancy
4,thank goodness a series you can lose yourself in no woke garbage just a fun watch that will keep you engaged bravo i hope to see more seasons of reacher
4,i really tried to give this season of the last of us a chance but its just bad bella ramsey didnt work for me in the first season and this one somehow made it worse the casting feels completely off the writing is weak and none of it comes across as believable the emotion feels forced the pacing drags and the tension never lands every episode feels like its trying too hard to be meaningful without earning it its like they lost sight of what made the original story so powerful and grounded just a big letdown from start to finish maybe they can do a spinoff or this will be the last of them
4,its really nice and soft its useful to raise and lower the volume according to your needs and to be able to select the function that one prefers at the moment the only small defect is the fact that its a bit noisy the movement that reproduces the breathits a purchase that i recommend
4,value for money product ordered for office staff
4,i wasnt able to purchase this item because i just couldnt get the size right in the bust the small puckered at the bust and i swam in the medium bummed because the colors are so vibrant and pretty and the length and flow were great
4,i cant wait for season this was a statement piece for video games turn tv show movies zaddy pascal was made to be joel his acting was top notch at first i was pretty sceptic of bella ramsey playing ellie but she bloody killed it both literally figuratively i also thought the show will end in two seasons but by the looks of it their most definitely stretching the show as long as they could which honestly im all in for now shall we talk about the video game to tv show perfect synergy from the zombies to each and every act sequences scenes were copied and pasted perfectly
4,i dont write reviews not even for really good potato chips or top notch gelato adrien brody nearly got me to stop watching this series over acting was that his inner marlon brando cause if it was retire that tired voice his italian was horrible too just needed to type this out or my head would explode
4,prons fast finger lock premium look at k approx got rtx no lag con no shutter camera heating issue built can be better overall its good if you have a tight budget of under k
4,bit too young bit too ripped a little too short and a bit too handsome for a true reacher representation but i know why they did it as everyones says it rights the wrongs of the films that fans just couldnt get their heads around with cruise in the role book fans will get plenty of nods to the details lee childs includes in his books you do not mess with the special investigations unit these are good adaptations of a very entertaining albeit not the most challenging book series this is one to be enjoyed and hopefully built on in future
4,ive been looking for a great macaroni n cheese recipe for very long this one is the best yet i added extra cheese and used fat free milk definitely making it again
4,i didnt think much of this online but it was very nice in person i was nervous it would look bulky but it was very flattering and slimming fits tts
4,cast performance was amazing ortega delivers as wednesday well rounded likable role it will become an iconic series for sure plot was a little shallow but ortegas performance hides most of that hopefully season will have more depth and layers looking forward to next season for sure if they can just keep whats going on in the world out of it very tired of shows adding stupid social media and politics crap nothing but lies hopefully the family will be more involved in the next season also it would be cool to see a wednesday sidekick sleuthing around with her watching her as it were enjoy
4,leaves clothes smelling lovely and keeps them soft
4,this is my first pair of mcguire jeans and i like the fabric and fit thank goodness for petite sizing these p fit just right on my hips with no gap between the waistband and my body fits through thigh and hips and pretty slim all the way down nice stretch of course the proof will be after wearing a few times and washing i will update my review if i do not like them so much after that
4,laptop is best for all things only problem with battery only to hrs backup when you have to use it before that plug in the charger after that you can use for hrs rest of this are excellent
4,i bought this laptop in k in summer sale after applying card offers and etc so in this price range its perfect value for money in my case pros design is good light weight laptop battery is around hours processor is working faster than older version of ryzen and also nice for multitasking bootup time is pretty fast around seconds dts sound is good and its working fine in supported devices and also in inbuilt speakers cons vram is low read more
4,this pair of flare is just what i have been searching for the color is a nice vintage blue i love the fit of the flare however please keep in mind these do run long and larger that size
4,i purchased this in the black and received it today it is silky feeling and is a quality camisole the color is a muted black not all shiny as some silks are and they often look cheap but this looks great and could be worn alone under leather or with a sweaterkimono i usually wear a medium in tops and this fit true to size i am and it doesnt look too long but i do wish it came in a petite still keeping it
4,i think these look great i found them on the sale rack and at w off its a pretty great deal i plan on wearing with low heels hope they work out i will show to boyfriend get his feedback too
4,this tunic dress is an easy go to outfit it looks put together immediately it is soft and comfortable i ordered the regular xs even though typically i prefer petite sizing this dress is above my knees in the front i am and weight about i would have ordered a petite size but had previously tried this on in the store and knew the regular sizing was a good fit for me in the store i tried the taupe color which seemed a bit see through i ordered the green and it is a lovely shade
4,haha the unifying theme in these reviews seems to be dont trust the picture i was misled by the neckline i thought i saw a structured kind of asianinspired mockneckfunnel thing and instead the top has a foldover cowl which with my full bust underneath it refuses to pose as a mockneck for me overall there isnt much structure here at all but the print is beautiful and the sweater cozy without being itchy
4,i wish i could have grown up in montana its such a beautiful state and seems to be unspoiled by the rest of american culture some scenes are just breathtaking in their panorama and even though i have equal vistas on my doorstep here in vancouver the feeling of unlimited space is very powerful that unlimited space well the entire metropolis of greater vancouver is about acres with ½ million people crammed in a ranch of this importance in montana would be about half this size close to acres with only a couple of hundred residents so yeah im talking unlimited space they mean it when they call it big sky country so how did one man and others of his ilk get to own so much land in less than years well of course they stole it from the indians and the indians want it back i would be mad too if i was an indian living in poverty while the white man makes billions off of my great grandfathers happy hunting grounds not only that but other well heeled americans want to escape the fetid swamps of the crime ridden cities and live an urban cowboy life of luxury in their own log cabin with a swimming pool and a country club to round things out the only way for developers to carve out a piece of the desirable wilderness and chop it up to lot sizes is to bully their way through and that my friends is the backdropplot for this superbly acted series costner is unassailable in his role as the rancher john dutton a no nonsense patriarch chiseled out of montana rock his family is the usual mix of screw ups and heroes but each and every one of them comes across as realistic characters i dont know who chose it but the music is just brilliant with a few tracks from jason isbell that will knock your socks off i warn you that youll be hooked if you start on episode one and you might not see light of day for a week or two because you cant step away the cowboy world still lives on in montana and wyoming the town centers seem to thrive unaffected by the woes of main street america tractors gotta be bought cows gotta eat fences gotta be built animals gotta be slaughtered its all business and its wonderfully portrayed in this series theres a lot of violence theres a lot of murder but somehow it all seems to be a natural part of life in montana just like it was natural in the sopranos guns are a part of life in an area where grizzlies wolves and mountain lions roam so its no surprise that theyre used to eliminate human problems too almost nothing in the way of wokeness but i dont know if they can avoid it to the series end well see enjoy it because its a very rare classic from the streaming trash factories
4,battery drain really fast
4,these are really good i added a shake of cloves in it too
4,this was the first suit ive ever ordered online and the first one piece ive tried since i was a very young girl so i was a little skeptical going into this im lbs b with a pear shape and short torso i was pleasantly surprised by the overall fitthe length was right the bottoms fit really well i was nervous about the boy shorthip hugger design and the suit was just very comfortable and cute however something about the cups just didnt work with my chest my breasts di
4,sure ultra right wing conservatives may be offended that what they see is a projection of how the country could become if their beliefs were taken to absurd lengths the story however is of a woman caught in a dreary confining and oppressive world of theological rules class hierarchies slavery religious justifications double standards and sadism masked as godfearing reverence the world is seen through her eyes as she fights to survive both mentally and emotionally what truly is scary is that the subjects portrayed actually have happened in our world the pace is not that of some adventure thrills story nor should it be the film tried to do that with the story and failed miserably the world is bleak and her life is not that of some victorian heroine who is destined to overcome her hardships and retire in a happy paradise the series is unique and tells a tale that is both horrifying and compelling as she strives to overcome and escape her situation no the stories do not resolve in easy one hour segments so those with short attention spans may ding the series boring but for anyone wanting to experience a dystopian world and see both its rise and decay while seeing how the world changes people into creatures who both bully and fight this is a great series
4,i really liked the show the show changed a few things but i didnt really hate it i liked the part in which its revealed who shot and missed but i kinda wished they kept the part with david as it was in the game loved ashleys cameo i really liked pedros and bellas chemistry as fatherdaughterduo bella did such an amazing job playing ellie she portrayed her so well pedro is the perfect joel lookswise and characterwise bella won the characterpart it was a bit weird seeing someone else other than the game ellie we know portray her but i got used to it and really liked bella as ellie the instead of are because of the few changes the show made its still such an amazing show but i feel like some parts of ellie and joel bonding were cut excited to see more
4,value for money slim and handy good performance for this price got this product on goat sale for k i th gen for this price is worth it battery back up is average getting hrs on normal usage the speaker is also average only if you have a budget of k go for a gen processor laptops overall not a bad product
4,bought this dress on sale in the orange as i feel like everything i have is black it is a pretty orange not too bright more of a rust color it is very soft as stated in other reviews and has a nice built in slip that is very comfortable i worry about pilling down the road but will have to wait and see i am not crazy about the seams down the chest area i think they could be more flattering but overall the dress is comfortable cute and easy to wear a perfect dress for the fallwinter with
4,i was blown completely away by this series ive always been a fan of wednesday she is my spirit animal but in this series shes a beast no other wednesday could fight like this one also i love that christina ricci is in it as well playing a teacher at nevermore she was my favorite wednesday but now shes number jenna ortega owned that part she was impressive i couldnt get enough of her i gave it stars because it exceeded my expectations i didnt think they could replace ricci as the best wednesday and somehow they did amd it worked so well the story was easy to follow and the characters were easy to love too it all blended perfectly into episodes and i hope there is a season fingers crossed
4,nice fabric and cute design a little low cut
4,wednesday follows the story of a teenage girl named wednesday addams the beloved character from the classic addams family franchise the series offers a unique and fresh take on the iconic character and viewers get to see her navigate the challenges of high school life while dealing with her familys eccentricities one of the things i enjoyed most about wednesday is its witty writing and clever humor the show does a great job of balancing its darker themes with plenty of humor making it both entertaining and compelling the talented cast especially jenna ortega in the lead role brings a fresh and unique perspective to the character however i must mention that while the show may appeal to fans of teen series it may not be for those who prefer more serious or adultoriented content additionally there were a few slow bits with supporting roles that could have been improved overall i would give wednesday an rating its a wellcrafted and entertaining series that offers a fresh take on a classic character and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and engaging teen series to watch on netflix
4,the best tv show i have ever watched the way it started the way it ended the way the events and the story pass how in the course of one episode many events begin and many events end in one episode the speed with which the events proceed the dialogues that take it to another level and the charisma of the characters and its strength and the brevity that collected all these events in episodes in seasons unlike some series i hate the way the fifth season ended but i was pleased with the sixth season i loved it because of the dialogues relationships strength and charisma of thomas shelby and how he escapes from problems and how he exploits others to his advantage he knows everything that is going on around him without knowing it and i loved how he expanded the scope of his business embarked on new businesses and new places and entered into several businesses politics and gangs wars
4,this was very good i only used half of the thyme and made my own crust delicious i used low sodium broth and no added salt
4,best product but display quality poor
4,good processing speed better display quality good battery backup overall better performance in this price range
4,overall i love this dress its warm with tights or leggings in cold temperatures and its super effortless there are a few things you should know prior to purchasing online though the dress runs large i ordered a large and its big im ok with it a super tight sweater dress is not was i was hoping for but i might have been able to order a medium i still kept the large the weave of the fabric does not seem as tight as pictured i felt the need to wear a tank top beneath because you cou
4,i created an account just to write this the mandalorian is the best tv show out right now the cinematography acting music and action is amazing star wars fans have been waiting for a live action tv show and this was the best thing we could have hoped for do yourself a favor and watch this even a non star wars fan would get into this
4,really love the print of this dress and the eyelet detailing around the neck very flattering
4,im a massive fan of fantasy and the game but for me it never really hit the mark some very confusing time lines interwoven along with some poor scripts never really hooked me i was left a little disappointed after so much anticipation
4,good product from good brand
4,i purchased this product for k and after using it for two days here are my observations pros excellent display quality good power backup impressive speed and performance lightweight and compact design cons sound quality is low and lacks volume charging time is longer than expected the resolution is and i think would be better the back design is plain and not visually appealing a gbps port would have been a nice addition note these impress read more
4,after week of use best laptop everything is working very good but when i update my window then this laptop doing automatically shutdown but i reinstall windows then this issue solved go with gb varient best value for money for ith gen ill update my review in month
4,outrightly outstanding every season is more intense than the last no flops suspense filled unpredictable a splash of humour the script gets more intriguing just when you think you cant hold your breath any longer the plot thickens then unfolds the whole shelby gang embodied their roles so beautifully tommy arthur john michael esme polly curly then solomons who ever scripted and produced this desavers multiple hall of fame awards i really love how bits of the story relates to tommys time in france im worried though how michael would turn out he seems to enjoy being bad a little to much season is my best season yet but im sure ild change my mind as i progress
4,i have purchased at the price of k and its really worth buying display performance almost everything is perfect
4,those are very cute and lavender color is very beautiful in person however i do not like the cut waist goes about inch higher than usual pilcro which for summer heat is something i do not find neither practical nor pretty and unfortunately i have to send them back also this year pilcro runs little bit tighter in waist than usual so you might consider ordering one size up if you are between sizes
4,i tried this on when i saw it hanging in the dressing room i was pleasantly surprised by this piece the color is beautiful not too yellow not too brown i have not worn it yet so im assuming it will hold up pretty well considering my other pieces from this designer are still looking good with several wears i bought this in a small size so it does not hang down like it does on the model perhaps thats why i dont need a cami underneath
4,saw this jacket online and decided to search in store for it i found it and although it definitely looks more mustard in the picture online compared to the bright yello it really is i felt it fit very well it runs large i usually am a size however i ended up buying a size for a more fitted cropped appearance the material is heavy but made very well and feels great on i recommend this blazer for any female that wants to brighten her closet up for spring
4,i love the print and design the photo does not do it justice i fell in love with it in the store but could not find my size i ordered my size online but it was still small and short it came up to my waist and was tight in the shoulders and waist i really wish it wasnt so small i love love this top the colors are vibrant and shiny totally my style i highly recommend it if it fits
4,overall i like the recipe like others i think either a little extra flower or some cornstarch would be good to help soak up some of the juices that might vary based on the top of applemy crust turned out great but even with extra minutes my apples still werent tender enough i used honeycrisp and a few golden delicious i wish now that id either tried another reviewers tip of covering the whole top with tin foil so i could have baked it longer or perhaps cooking the apples in a sauce pan for minutes to give them a head start ps i probably would have chosen jonathans or jonagolds if my store had them
4,now this guy is jack reacher not that pisspot pos cruise plus i love roscoe shes got the best bum on tv she the girl next door who becomes a cop looks great in uniform and better in tight jeans
4,mind blowing laptop amazing go for itnice performance
4,this laptop can support upto k videos simple task can be done in this battery only lasts for hrs spaeaker is good
4,and in the next scene the imbecile negotiator announces a shell destroy her own companys leverage by driving the target company into bankruptcy where its assets will sit in limbo she claims shell be able to dictate termsno thats what shes trying to do now and b humiliates the companys founder to the point where hed almost surely tell this belligerent fool to eff off rather than surrender his ownership of his own company beyond ridiculous and were only nine minutes in if a horse has to be put down you shoot it through the forehead poor creature wikipedia gives you far more credible information than we see from this rancher who not only is likely to further mutilate the horse without ending its pain but may also be on the receiving end as the bullet ricochets off the poor animals bone structure unbelievable
4,this dress just feels and looks amazing i love how it isnt too short like a lot of new styles i think it will be wonderful with leggings or tights in the winter i also love the plaid cuff detail the only drawback is the buttons need to be reinforced i got home and realized one button was missing i went to the store to swap for a new one and when i went to cuff the arms buttons popped off
4,the concept of this sweater is really pretty my usual size xl fit perfectly not tight or too loose the color of the sweater is not like the photo there is a lot more of a brown tone by putting the sweater on and taking it off i must have torn a hole because there is a inch tear in the front where the peplum bottom panel has been felted to the body of the sweater it literally pulled apart where the two fabrics meet the other issue i have with the sweater is the area where the front a
4,i binge watched this tv show in just two days because it was made to be very addictive with ethereal music beautiful scenery perfect scripting and character development it was just such treat that i forgot everything else characters are very interesting multidimensional and none of them are underdeveloped that along with alluring music takes the show to another level second season was a lot sexier than the first of course left me with a thought that there had been some temporary loss of ideas however it turned out better than i had expected the plot itself is fairly simple and it is repeated on the second season i believe that repeating the plot is going to wear after such a spectacular finale of the second season it felt like a good point for a conclusion but as it happens this thing is going to get renewed
4,i ordered this shirt aware of what the other reviewers said about it being tight in the chest its true its a bit restrictive if you need fullrange of motion for your shoulder blades but if youre not planning on doing any heavylifting or sporting events in this top its just fine disclaimer i am smallchested i will stick by my tts though because it was the right fit despite being restrictive i was worried the top was going to be a hard jean but it wasnt it was nice and sof
4,product is justifiable for its value for money a decent product long lasting for normal use someone can start with this if learning and st of use kind of product
4,so amazing the cast the songs everything is perfect i cant wait for the second seasonmany thanks to present us such as this masterpiece
4,the dress is cute but im somewhat concerned that it will be sheer in the sunlight i guess well have to wait and see
4,this tops subtle golden shimmer from the metallic thread used in the detailing is really nice flattering a bit special all in all nice but the white is see through and the green somehow reads much more casual at least to me so a good top for times when your top being sheer isnt such a big deal but probably not for the office
4,an retailer associate gave me this to try on since i love white clothing and lace i tried on a large for my c hourglass frame and found it to be a tad large and probably could go down a size my thoughts are _______________ pros breathable and comfortable fabric due to cottonlinen blend lace detailing at the top is lovely runs tts except i found the arms ran a tad small and i have smaller circumference but theres enough stretch _______________ cons extremely sheer
4,incredible actors production setting editing etc except it lacks a compelling story season was great but by season it was clear they didnt know what they were gonna do it with it became terribly unbelievable and the characters have a switch in personality the character development in the first season is completly forgotten i do believe the first season is worth the time
4,i have made this soup twice now love the flavours i do find that it is a bit thin for a creamy soup i tried pureeing some of the cauliflower and adding it back in but i think next time i make it i will try reducing the amount of water used to cook the vegetables overall a yummy soup recipe
4,this was purchased for my cell phone it was easy to plugged in and my phone recognized it instantlythe adaptor that comes with the device i had some problems with the adaptor has a write protection switch that both my toshiba and hp laptops like to turn on while inserting it into the sd slot to get around this i have to insert this adaptor at a slight angle and apply a little pressure to try and not let that switch get changed on insertion it works but it is a pain fortunately since the chip is in my phone of the time it is not a pain i deal with too often it is something that may need to be considered though if you plan on using this device primarily in the standard sized sd slot of a laptop or computer
4,shipped quickly plug and play just like it says and i havent noticed any bottlenecking on my phone due to slow speeds
4,the show is vgood at keeping interest and the visual impact is extraordinary there is a lot of room for things to happen however the characters are very flawed and not very appealing it is hard to find anything appreciably admirable in any of the characters greed power cruelty duplicity corruption and megalomania seem to rule the day the people depicted in the show arewell convincing in their deficits and excesses and demonstrate the sickness that ties of blood family can produce the most disturbing fact is that the characters in yellowstone are quite believable they seem every bit as insane as the caricatured cast of dallas old evening soap opera without the parody hyperbole and humor of that old show we knew the dallas characters were a parody of themselves the yellowstone characters on the other hand are not exaggerations they are not parodies they are not hyperbolic they are in fact dead serious a story well told but not one that allows any feeling of goodness or redemption or even hope to surface in the face of the ugly qualities on display from nearly every corner of the screen maybe my misgivings are that it is all a bit too real too raw and too contemporary all this does not make it a bad work just not an easy watch
4,i was looking for an offtheshoulder top and chose this one it is pretty the bottom of the shirt is fairly billowy so i can only wear with skinny pants takes a little getting use somewhat restricting my arm movement so the shirt pops off my upper arms
4,this is a beautiful dress but if you have any hips at all you may find it difficult to find the right size i usually wear a p and found that that the op was too snug on the bottom while the p was too loose on top for reference so if you are perfectly proportioned it could work for you also note that this is a pencil dressvery slim fittingprobably best suited for a cocktail party
4,made these for a halloween party added teaspoons of all spice and teaspoons of nutmeg because i thought it could use more flavor when i tasted the batter also did as another poster suggested and used oz of cream cheese and that was perfect for the icing icing was thin so next time i make it i will leave out the milk completely very good baserecipe though
4,working smoothly worth of money overall good battery backup also
4,i was immediately drawn to this dress when i saw it in the store im normally a size but i feel like the size two was too constricting in the chest and arms so found a size to be just right its longer and a bit wider than the size everywhere else but given the design i thought it was fine the main thing to note is that the top is snug and has no give whatsoever if you have a larger bust or broader shoulders sizing up is a must lengthwise it fit me like it does on the model i t
4,using the card for videos and music have already filled it up and it works great playing back my media
4,loved everything about this sweater but the short length didnt notice in the pictures but the last one of the back of the model shows the length it barely reached the very top of my jeans so would have to wear something under or id be flashing my stomach all the time worked a bit better with skirts but still too cropped for my frame wish it was longer in length and would have been a new fall favorite really great color and design besides that just make sure you are wanting the sh
4,just ok
4,i have to disagree with earlier reviewers who suggested this top isnt flattering for largerbreasted women im breastfeeding so i currently have dds that are the bane of my existence and i was very happy with the way this top fit across my chest i didnt give it a full stars for aestheticdesign only because i wish it were a bit longer it hit me below my waist but not below the crotch of my jeans where it hits the model possibly because she is not burdened by swollen breasts the shir
4,good laptop jeeves installation is free of cost
4,my husband has banned me from calling this chili but rather soup i doubled everything in the recipe for my larger slowcooker and then cut out cup of liquid it still came out soupy and i think i would cut out another cup next time stille very good for a cold day when all you want is soup ready right when you get home if you like things spicer dont seed the chili and add more
4,this is a good base recipe but the flavor is a bit flat if you bake much the lack of vanilla extract and the small amount of salt would jump out at you right off the bat also for those having trouble getting them to be thick an chewy remember that its virtually impossible to over mix dough until youve added the flour get it good and fluffy make sure to scrape the sides of the bowl several times if youre using a stand mixer i made the following changesadditions and the richness of the flavor was extremely popular with friends tsp salt tsp cinnamon tsp vanilla extract tsp lebkuchengewurz german gingerbread spice i use a disher for consistency my old convection oven would finish them in minutes my recent one takes minutes
4,the tgp of the rtx with gb of vram is watts and this is quite good for the price than the low tgp ones and the build quality is also pretty solid for the price
4,it works great good size good and good price only giving it stars because it is a little slow to write and read from but it is to be expected from an xc card with speeds up to mbs i believe
4,pretty good i doubled it and added chopped onion because a soup without onion seemed weird and extra cheese i also added some freshly grated parmesan and romano cheeses lawrys garlic salt and tony chacheres creole seasoning instead of the hot sauce i omitted the salt and pepper from the roux and added to taste after i combined the cheese sauce to the vegetables i wouldve gave it to a without my tweaks i will use this recipe again for broccoli cheese soup
4,love this top i just purchased this shirt from my local retailer store i noticed it when i walked in and saw it on display its stylish comfortable and subtle it runs large so size down normally i wear a medium in retailer tops but needed a small the flower print is small and the colors are muted against the black pairs well with several colors black like model dark denim olive green and mauve the display had it tucked into a soft khaki colored pair of pants that worked as well
4,what can you say but wow wow wow wow to be completely honest i love star wars be it movies series comics or what have you ive even tolerated jar jar binks for crying out loud but this andor wow i have not been this enthralled with any star wars for years story characters buildup suspense action everything with this series moreover diego luna has risen to galactic stardom from the first episode it is crystal clear that this is something different the writers have taken their time not too short not too long to appropriately build characters even those that initially seem inconsequential are properly built and later on it makes total sense if you were to watch single episodes it would seem like a mashup of different unrelated stories but every single story every thread is spun perfectly creating a web of intrigues that explains so much in the entire star wars universe as some other reviews mention cgi and explosions are part of the background they are not the story visually this is a masterpiece as for storytelling one of the best examples seen in recent cinematic history man i think im gonna binge watch it again right now
4,easy to wear cute comfywill be a go to for summer
4,i really wanted to like this dress the material design length and fit all over was perfect except for the armholes too big and the ruffles came right upto the nipple line not comfortable with that sadly had to return
4,tasty comfort food substantial meal for a cold day my husband loved it the prep time is not accurate if you peal and cut your own potatoes onions and carrots count on prep time of at least hours if you buy a rotisserie chicken from costco or another store you need to buy two chickens for this recipe this recipe makes large pies its enough supposedly to feed people but realistically pies will feed about adults because you will eat more than an eighth of a pie we are average adults and the two of us ate a half of a pie its so heavy that you will not need anything else other than the pie for dinner the diced potatoes get lost in the pie maybe i should cut them in larger pieces next time this would be a great hit for a pot luck
4,the only complaint i would have about this pullover is that it runs a little big i ordered a small and it is a little big for my taste but it is not something worth returning it for i wouldnt say to size down but be aware it is larger than what you would expect still love it
4,this show is about a group of people gone vacationing on an island and also the hotel employees who try to please their guests the show basically starts with the ending of the vacation where one of the guests waits in the airport while a dead body is being loaded onto the airplane and then the show starts days before this type of dark situation comedy isnt my type of thing but the opening did got me hooked to see how they got to that place there are lots of entertaining awkward cringey gross moments in the show with characters that i didnt really care for its not something that i would like to see a season of i mainly check it out for alexandra daddario and sydney sweeney
4,this dress is great but extremely short im wear a size the looked like a tunic on me it was so short
4,i really liked this top i wish it was not so sheer even with a nude bra its just too much its a very loose fit throughout the body but the shoulders arms and neckline remain true to size so it looks nicely tailored on the top i just cant do something this sheer i feel too exposed i wish they had it offered in other colors
4,the storyline heavily contributes to my review especially the ending from which i made the title the characters actors the story its incredible i have expected a lot worse considering netflix was behind it not that ive personally watched much this is an opinion based on others experiences but im heavily surprised im not affiliated with the addams family by that i mean i havent watched close to any content related to them but this is incredible ive cried screamed cheered all the stuff lots of plottwists near the ending it just makes me want a second season the whole story in general is fantastic really like the murder mystery stuff honestly in my book
4,great laptop test
4,ordered online just received this vest so disappointed love the garment but it is way too small i wear a medium in most clothing and size in a dress but the medium in this vest isnt just snug it is definitely too small even worn alone i cant button it i am now ordering the large and keeping my fingers crossed as i want to wear a tee under it hoping i wont need to return both the m and the l thinking of ordering an xl
4,this is a great event for any jack reacher fans the films were a laughable disgrace with a man who thought his ego would be enough to match up to lee childs real creation it was sad and so disappointing the resurrection of reacher by amazon is great fun and allows us to see jack reacher as lee child intended i have often thought how angry and frustrated he would have been with himself by abandoning this iconic character to tom cruises ego
4,these bars taste great i like to add cup of chopped walnuts or pecans to the bar recipe in order to add extra flavor and some crunch i also prefer a thicker bar so i bake this recipe in a xxinch pan the icing is very good and a perfect addition to these bars
4,good cleaning product of you have kids with sensitive skin
4,good recipe anyone whose ever made these kinds of cookies knows you need to whip the egg whites unsure why people get mad about that i made it keto style with unsweetened coconut coconut flour and stevia came out just like your photo and they taste great thank you for the recipe
4,i saw these paired with the denim swing tank in the store and was inspired by the nautical look the fit was a little snug i am between a in pants and definitely had to go with the and even that was a little tight for reference i am and lbs curvy on bottom the sales lady said they will stretch and there is some give to them but i dont anticipate a lot of stretch they are slim fitting all the way down and are flattering to the rear i think they look better in person than on
4,very soft and very cute this plush has a serene and reassuring look perfect to keep you company and accompany the little ones towards sleep it is powered by fleece stylus included in the package that you go to insert in the big command placed inside the otter one thing i very welcome is the possibility to wash the plush in the washing machine having the possibility to remove easily and quickly the electric part placed inside through the internal command you can set all the functions of the plush from the type of sound emitted noise of nature white noise breath music melodies or heartbeat the volume of the sound effects the activation of the movement and lighting of the tummy once set to activate the plush will press the tummy and for about minutes will continue with the program set unfortunately there is a detector of tears that would make it really perfect making it automatically activate in case of night awakening the plush is still very nice and the combination of the many sounds make the most suitable
4,this is a great coverup or tunic over leggings or capris i am foot two and it comes to my knee
4,the sandisk ultra gb is just a storage device so i dont find that there will be many features to get excited about that being said it is advertised as having mbs transfer speed but this is misleading it can read up to mbs however and the packaging says this too it writes at a slower rate i used this for my phone too much music and had the stock gb microsd that came with my phone i had about gb of data that i wanted to transfer back to my new microsd card and this took about minutes if this were a strict transfer from my internal hard drive to an external it would be faster but this is not such a connection it lost a star because the transfer took so long but in reality i dont expect to be transferring gbs of data anytime soon so this problem will be minimal for me other than that it works great and i have not had any issues with the formatting or reading
4,praise be this show is great i knew id love it when i saw the commercials for it so i decided i would read the book by margeant atwood which is now a hit show on hulu so thats what i did you should really read the book before watching the show it will clear up a lot of stuff thats not explained in the show the handmaids tale is a bit hard to understand for some folks so let me break it down for you the handmails tale is based on the book by margaret atwood about a futuristic time where men are sterile and women are barren and the wealthy men select women to be their handmaid to bare the wifes children to repopulate the world the book and show tells a story about offred played by elizabeth moss who was married and had a child and was living the perfect life until one day her world completely changed due to the government taking over the world and basically sending women to slave labor to be handmaids to rich masters wife to give birth to their children because they cant have any children anyway you might be wondering the handmaid have the weird names like offred ofglen or ofsteven well the women who are taken into the homes of the masters take on their first name to give up their selves so when they go out to shop or prayer meetings you know who you belong to i loved elizabeth as offred oh my god i hope she wins an emmy this year for her performance because she pour her heart and soul into this role when she tells off this mexican woman who comes for a visit i wanted to reach into my tv and give her a hug youll have to see it to know what i mean but trust me if they play that one scene at the emmys shell win hands down basically the show is dealing with the lives of these women and how they are dealing with having their rights taken away from them and live a pure and faithful life towards their masters the aunts i wanted to smack them because they treat the women like crap they beat them smack them around torture them if they get out of line and really cruel for no reason at all should you watch this show oh my god yes but keep in mind it is a matv show so its for an mature audience and i would read the book before viewing to have a better understanding of what your in for do what i did read the book get hulu for a month and then get rid of it easy simple and only
4,very good the only change i made was adding sauteed jalapeno to the salsa mixture just because we like it spicy and i had them in the garden i will definitely make it again
4,very good but mine came out a little soupier than i expected the leftovers thickened up and were perfect i served it over brown rice next time i will use large or jumbo shrimp the medium shrived up too much
4,this dress is perfect for any occasion it looks great with every shoe and is flattering on
4,this is just amazing work that the cast put in with the hands effects and transformations and all this show i would recommend for people that dont really get scared that much by frightening scenes the amazing stuff the cast did with their characters and their personalities just wows me there are some swear words some romance and some bloodgore in the first season and maybe in the second one but i just love it jenna ortega did an awesome job playing the role of wednesday addams and everyone else did their roles amazingly to people hoping this is an actual addams family spinoff probably wont be happy because this is about wednesday mainly i so recommend this show
4,this is a really good soup for the whole family to enjoy after reading the reviews i did make a few minor adjustments i used black beans instead of pinto beans large oz canned diced tomatoes in place of stewed and diced w green chiles cans and more water to cups because i wanted a true soup i did add the can of green chiles and there was plenty of flavor i will definitely make this again
4,i bought this blouse in plum it is very beautiful and is a gorgeous color for fall since i bought this inperson i decided to try it on i am normally an xsmall in retailer blouses i tried on the xsmall and although it did fit there isnt much room this could be a problem for women who are bustier and fuller in the chest and arm area
4,this dress you will want to try on in the store it is very thick and stiff fabric the whole front is embroidered and the big drawback for me is that waist seam there is absolutely no give in that waist this is not stretchy fabric and not easy for just any body type to wear sad because it is very pretty on the rack
4,the perfect flowy fall top the material is thin so it may pick a little but i love it
4,super but battery backup is bad
4,ok so this top runs extremely large for referencei am a typical medium but i ended up purchasing an extrasmall besides the sizing issue the style is super cute and perfect for any summer occasion whether casual or more formal i definitely recommend ps beware it does wrinkle easily lol
4,i will by this laptop rs is value for money laptop but this build quality is good but not great this laptop battery backup is normal like hours and heavy used hours so improve in battery backup laptop is fast from the ssd and gb ram so performance is best in the laptop heat issue in this laptop and heat cooling driver is not present then laptop is heated display is good and great also but there edges slightly weak but this price laptop is best laptop use in the care no pr read more
4,this is a very good recipe but ive now made it several times with and without the sausage and we think its better without the sausage since its less greasy i just add a little of the traditional sausage spices to the grind beef and increase the ground beef lean proportionately we make it about nice a month these day sometimes more often in winter
4,made this cake for st patricks day the cake is absolutely wonderful the recipe calls for cups of powdered sugar not pounds as stated in a previous review this is one of my go to cake recipes will make it againand againand again
4,lord hammercy this pie was a back breaker for me i had to keep thinning out the mixture with more chicken broth than anticipated but i finally got there thanks for a very tasty pie this recipe rocks will def make again
4,pros good price to performance good after sales service easy to take apart great form factor for gaming and casual use comes with an extra nvme slotpcie for more storage cons speakers are useless usb ports are not good quality need to fiddle around to make sure all pins make contact screen blead keyboard gets very hot while gaming but the temps are within normal range
4,this memory is the right price and it worked right from the starti think this is a good deal and good memoryworks fine in note
4,just received samsung book gen gb ram so far all working fine will review for a month
4,sound quality is good but not more working time laptop heating more display is very good game play smoothly
4,watched the entire season in one go no breaks except lunch tea and doggy walk started at am and done by pm ist enjoyed it thoroughly been a long time since i binge watched
4,very comfy and light can be casual with jeans and boots or dress it up with a nice necklace and pencil skirt
4,i am glad that i went for the ryzen version over intel honestly i took a riskbut it paid offthis version is as good as the intel oneone of my friends has it and its cheaperat least k difference this laptop has a very attractive designis weightless and easy to use display is really good especially to watch high quality videos
4,love them i always add a little extra chili powder and lime juice and i put them on hard taco shells or make the chicken for nachos family favorite
4,this recipe is fantastic by itself i have played around with it a little bit and i like adding swissamerican cheese before adding the tomatoes it melts so well and gives a creamy texture to the dish swissamerican cheese can be found at any local grocery store its comes in sandwich squares another idea is rather then chicken you can to fish my family likes grouper rather then coat the whole fish i season it and mix italian bread crumbs with melted butter and put that mixture only on top of the fish and add the swiss chesse and diced tomatoes from a can that i drain very well cook it for minutes or so or until it flakes and it turns out fantastic
4,i started watching this show with anticipation having seen the trailers before its release on the streaming platform i loved the classic tv series and the previous films with raul julia but the more episodes i watch of this new tim burton produced series the less interest i had in continuing the production quality is good and expected given tim burton is directing it but there is just something off about the tv series that make it so different from the previous addam family shows i didnt care for the xmen like school of odd balls or the scubbydoo mystery at the heart of the film this show just had too much of a disney vibe to it especially with the casting yeah this wasnt for me but perhaps it will appeal to the newer generation who grew up with the xmen umbrella company comic book films sad because i thought the first episode was good i like what wednesday character did at the pool that was funny but the mystery behind the hyde monster not so much
4,this shirt is a great deal on salei would not pay full pricei got it in the honey color and it is really cute this shirt does run very large i normally wear a small or size to and i was lost in a size i went with a size and it was perfect for sizing purposes i am a c and lbsshirt is a bit lightweight so it is nice for summer or year round
4,so much promise stellar source material an interesting and quirky protagonist that found an entirely believable actor claiming his turn in a starring role real reacher fans will love the first season as its largely true to the first novel season however starts like the book but quickly devolves into a cgi laden ethan huntish cruise version nonsensical dumpster fire deviating greatly from the original story the creators of this tripe apparently thought they could out cool the original and failed miserably there is simply no need to push so far into the suspension of belief its not true to the spirit of reacher sad i will give season three basically an episode to show me theyve pulled their proverbial heads from their apparently rather large anuses if not theres much better television to watch
4,nice tshirt the print is very nice and the fabric is soft and flowing i love the baseball cut it gives it a different look
4,very good i made loaves to use the whole can of pumpkin i subbed applesauce for the oil
4,it is my first laptop and i found it worth the price i got this laptop for like k after using bank discounts and to be honest the laptop comes with good packaging from company and has a very sleek and good design overall the processor is quite good not that flagship level as it is a entry level laptop and display is like good u can watch movies nicely no problems at all the only thing that i found a little disappointing is speakers it is quite low but if u have external speakers or wear read more
4,i got this product a few days ago and used it already many times while you might think a refreshing shower gel is quite liquid in its form you could feel the cucumber extrat which i found great often products say things on their bottle and dont truly mean it whereas the simple product was not one of them secondly the smell is amazing and my skin has not badly acted upon it i do think it is a good product but it might not please others as well this review was collected as part of a promotion
4,i bought a similar top by same manufacturer in fall in xs this time it ran huge and had to order xxs which fit fine its very cute on
4,i didnt love it enough to buy it but did think it was cute i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are
4,good performance good design overall very good product thanks
4,good quality this price
4,this looks really cute online i was super excited to get it and i ordered my regular size in maeve i got a size i am the top is very pretty and the fabric is nice but it is very short it didnt even cover my stomach and didnt come to the top of my jeans im sending it back maeve usually runs big but you cant tell from the photo and the size chart that its more of a crop top disappointing since almost every size is sold out
4,oddly enough i took my sweet time getting around to watching the witcher as it was based on a computer game and those movies then to do quite poorly but after several people telling me that i as an avid player of roleplaying games should sit down and watch the witcher i eventually did turns out that i was missing out on something very enjoyable now i didnt particularly enjoy game of thrones as it was way too heavy on political drama intrigue backstabbing and such i found the witcher to be right up my alley as this felt more at home and to have elements found in roleplaying games to it and the fact that henry cavill completely nailed it with his performance as geralt of rivia was just spectacular i think the witcher definitely puts the notion of henry cavill being nothing more than just a superman clone on ice for me he simply was brilliant in this role so wellcast the series does also boast other great performances from the likes of anya chalotra adam levy joey batey and lars mikkelsen the witcher is a great combination of action character interaction and plot the mixture definitely worked for me however while there was a red line to the series and the episodes it just felt a little bit too much like every episode was a standalone episode that you could watch out of chronological order especially since the characters were in one location in one episode then a completely different location in the next episode without explaining how the transition went of getting there or why the special effects in the witcher were good and i especially liked the cgi on the creatures in the last episode and the magical effects were also nicely brought to life on the screen by means of realistic cgi now i havent played the games nor read the novels so i have no idea how true the netflix series is to the source material nor do i really care because i found the witcher to be very enjoyable entertainment i am rating the witcher eight out of ten stars and i am definitely looking forward to more seasons and following the adventures of geralt of rivia the witcher is wellworth spending time on sitting down to watch
4,seems to be working just finebought as a gift for a family member and theyre using it for video recording
4,loved it so much cant wait for season the plot is really good acting and god the cgi is amazing loved everything
4,i love this product and used for a few years however i have just purchased a new tub which is much smaller than the last tub they are both ml i not sure the new tub can be because of the smaller size i hope we are not been misled
4,flattering poncho pair well with leggings or skinny jeans and booties
4,oh my woe as a tv convincer i can personally say that this series was amazing while there are a few improvements to be made like the cgi of the monster the ending however was masterfully not expected right from the beginning it was clear the casting was on point and the directing was to die for the mix of comedy suspense and dark humor was immaculate while i will not spoil the show for anyone what you see is not what you woe you will get the pun after watching it not even minutes ago from writing this review i just finished the s ep and im still shaking honestly wish i could be apart of this masterpiece myself but watching it will just have to do for anyone curious you could watch this with a teenager and it in my opinion will be a teen friendly adventure although id advise parents to watch it to see if their teen could have issues such as nightmares etc its not scary but it does have perfectly timed jump scares and could frighten a younger child in conclusion this is a must see and one that you will not regret with its perfectly timed suspense dark humor and great acting you may want to grab some popcorn before saying woe

4,i found this recipe to be lacking something so i threw in a few extra things and it turned out pretty well i used only tsp oregano instead of garlic cloves i used garlic powder i also added a handful of spinach and some wild rice i added a little of a seasoning blend and added fresh ground pepper
4,excellent laptop however there are some glitches
4,gt i totally loved these cute cupcakes but i turned them n holiday breads i used the zucchini crushed pineapple raisins amp either chopped walnuts or pecans salted wow they were so good i made and all of them got sold at the christmas craft festival this year i will make these again both as cupcakes and breads
4,im not sure what i expected but this is one of the best series netflix has its a great mix of comedy creepy nostalgia and the graphics music etc are all entertaining this is a home run for netflix jenna ortega nails this role im not sure thats good for catherine zeta jones though heres the deal about the family and i get that the show needs wednesday to be strongest but anjelica huston was legit the best morticia since the original on tv but catherine doesnt have that morticia adams feel luiz guzman doesnt feel like gomez im just not feeling him and the kid playing pugsley def isnt a fit the other actors and actresses in the series are great like legit everyone in addition to jenna the actress from game of thrones who plays the head of the school is so good her name escapes me at the moment but shes great the two boys that like wednesday and her have a really interesting and strong chemistry too the actress playing her school dorm mate is really good too christina ricci is great too but oddly looks like an older wednesday lol all the other cast of characters on point i really am surprised by the entire thing and really found myself enjoying it thanks to netflix and they need to keep this one going a free seasons its like one of their best series
4,i like the jeans a lot theyre definitely skinny fit and more like leggings very stretchy i feel like they would fit all shapes and sizes because of that give so the claim that theyre flattering on everyone is probably valid i also appreciate that there is no stonewashing as grey jeans often seem to have they are all one hue from top to bottom with a little bit of linear line texture to the fabric the only flaw at least i dont think its intentional is that the front pockets l
4,good pr
4,i saw this on a mannequin at the store and was instantly drawn in by all the beautiful blue lace and the overall design however when i tried it on i personally found a few things that just didnt work for me ____________ pros blue lace is lovely throughout nicely done theres a little snap closure at the front of the dress where the fabric overlaps at the bra cups i can only assume its to make it easier to get the dress on its a nice little detail although not sure if really
4,the first trailer had me interested the cast and creative team had me intrigued the first episode had be hooked and the final one has left me yearning for more jenna ortega who plays the lead of the show wednesday herself brings such a unique performance to the role yet makes it feel nostalgic and reminiscent of those who came before her speaking of which it was incredibly smart to bring back christina ricci for a role in this show as a nice easter egg for the fans of the prior ortega fully embraced the character and became her on another level time for me to check out more of her work for sure the cinematography is very tim burtonish with a modern twist to it you can feel his directive presence throughout the entire show the writers did an incredible job as well to take an already existing iconic character which is a bold move and dive deeper into her personal story and life the music and sound design was also very much like the theme of the show and the previous ones the nailed the atmosphere and overall vibe for me really well i was afraid at first that they would normalize wednesday too much after all i feel she should remain an intriguing and morbid character with surely a lot of underlying depth underneath her deadpan witty personality she was exactly that in this show and im very happy about that wednesday remains to be an absolute boss as she should be she was humanized in subtle ways and with slow steps without forcing any narratives or uncharacteristic traits the acting was pristine jenna ortega was the perfect pick for the role and she crushed it her costars manage to not disappoint either next to a presence like hers gwendoline christies character surprised me a lot her performance subtle emotion motivation traits elevated her character and transformed her from a somewhat antagonist to a beloved awesome figure whos presence was constantly felt throughout the show i was also presently surprised by hunter doohan and emma myers whom respectively play tyler and enid great things await these brilliant actors i thought the casting of the other addams family members was just perfect and worked well as an addition to the show the way thing moves and communicates brought back some very nostalgic feels i love it the twists were great and some more unexpected than others the detectiveish theme of the show had me hooked from the beginning till the end i truly hope theyll release more seasons which i assume they will since this show will no doubt break the internet not doing so would woe my mind
4,as stated by others this is the type of unique retailer product that i love and that makes me return to the store again and again i would have given it stars if the sleeves were lined and the body length was longer the sleeves are indeed long although this adds to the coziness but i would have loved the body a bit longer like other cardigans have been im looking forward to wearing it as soon as we get a bit more cool here congratulations retailer for a winner
4,this is an adorable little top the tank has such beautiful detailing on the chest the flowers are more red than pink i found it to be tts on me the tank is flowy and loose
4,excellent product in the price
4,bought it as addition to my tablet samsung note edition is great for storing pictures and very good at a reasonable price
4,this is another ive been looking for me a funnelneck sweatshirt to feign athleticism with i love it the material is incredibly soft and warm the fit is a little snug around a larger bust and the lines would probably be more flattering on a more well modelesque frame but im thoroughly attached size up if youre looking for movement
4,color and style was pretty but the sleeves were so long i had to return it cuffing the sleeves wasnt an option because you would lose the cute piping detail and see the inside seam
4,what a great recipe for family fare been meaning to try these for some time and today amidst everyones middecember runningaround i discovered some plans had changed and i needed to provide a last minute supper whilst still running errands i found i had all the ingredients and they came together and cooked speedily i made exactly to recipe and they tasted great this must rank as a toh classic thanks for sharing and for keeping available for decades for us to enjoy
4,i have the jeans version of these pants and these run smaller and theyre a little thinner than jeans i like the style and i looove the jeans but ill have to exchange these for one size bigger and see if they work
4,i like the skirt that said it is going to the tailor to have some of the fullness taken out just a lot of material going on and heavier than you might have imagined i will wear it fall winter with white navy cardigans
4,please keep this going dont let it end i watch a lot of tv and have some all time favourites this has topped the lot ive got so many friends and family watching it now the story doesnt have to end keep it up everything was done perfectly from the acting to the story to the costume design it was magical and im hoping to see a season soon after watching season i planned on giving a go and thought it would not even come close because its a new story and new characters but oh my god its even better so far this is some top notch tv as i said please keep the both going when something isnt broke dont try to fix it brilliant writing on both
4,used chicken stock added carrots celery and onion seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before cooking it cooked cups of noodles separately the soup is bland but indeed comforting
4,i really like the characters and storyline great acting and writinglove it
4,i am surprised there is a th season as season wrapped things up so well and seemed as if it was written to end there the obvious didnt have to be shown not every ribbon had to be tied perhaps the popularity caused them to continue beyond season the tight understated horror of an extreme theocracy wonderful acting and amazing art direction of the first seasons is just gone in the th season there is nothing more to see here except a terrible action series watching elizabeth moss being overly melodramatic in boring chase scene after chase scene needless suspense the range of her omg theyre after us and oh the horror expressions is amazing and sad scream queen she is not but thats all there is here the plot lines are also repeating which happens when a series has run its course yet continues on like a bad marriage did we endure seasons to find ourselves back at square one yes sadly i decided to stop watching after se but checking in with episode but its just laughably bad season could have gone somewhere new and if had sustained the tightness and beauty of the first it might have worked its like the writing and direction of season were by a whole new crew do watch the first seasons which are some of the best ever in the series genre but leave it at that nothing worse than loving a series and then getting such a bad taste by a season too far got talking about you too
4,although true to size i sized up to improve pocket placement and for a longer and slouchier fit like on the model the pockets in my regular size were almost too high up and made my midsection look bunchy
4,i wore this dress to dinner right after my boyfriend proposed to me it will be perfect to wear to any bridal event like a bridal shower rehearsal dinner or engagement party i ordered a size and the mock neck is a bit snug there wasnt any difference really between a size or so i kept the size since it fit better in the waist its beautifully made and feels like it will hold up well its casual but still interesting it felt just a bit above my knees a perfect length i paired i
4,i have waited for a show that would blow me off for a long time and this one did the trick i love how the story is unfolded with every episode in a dark tone and the character build up is so fine this has the potential to be the next big tv show after the likes of game of thrones
4,this dress is adorable its a perfect casual look for summer and the quality is nice with the lining though still overpriced in my opinion the tie detail is somewhat adjustable and i found my normal size s to fit fine where this gets me is the fact that its dry cleantotally doesnt make sense for a dress that is essentially a fancy tshirt for summer i might bring it back for that alone since i originally planned to wear it a lot
4,this is a very nice blouse usually i am size bought size l and it fits very well would not size up the fit is very forgiving hides tummy i like the vneck fabric does not look like polyester and of good quality the blouse is versatile looks good with skinny dark or white jeans recommend
4,im petite and pear shaped so im small on top and curvy around the hips and love the way this dress fits its a relaxed fit so its not super fitted and its loose around the waist which is great its a wonderful casual dress to wear with a pair of tall boots i adore it
4,as others have said this dress does run large i ordered the xxs petite and ti isalmsot big on me hips are wide so at least it is comfortable in width material is a bit scratchier than i am used to s well color is great and it looks nice when i see it on my stylist who convinced me to hold on to it for a little thinking about it my zipepr was also a little hard to work shorter than some other dresses
4,excellent much better than i was expecting i always vote or to counter trolls in reality this is a strong acting and production are excellent have to admit i nearly switched it off you need to get past the first minutes of episode as it is drawing the links to adams family it wont bother you again theres definitely a harry potter vibe going on at times and others agatha christie with an adams family and adams family creep vibe and thats what they were going for so well done wednesday is developed as an individual character and potentially exciting i can see many series as they grow too theres a plethora of potential ways the wednesday character could be taken i look forward to it
4,best product in this price range
4,great fit with tight pants beautiful flower design that goes with everything favorite tshirt
4,seasons set in a dystopian future a woman is forced to live as a concubine under a fundamentalist theocratic dictatorship imagine if this actully happens you being kidnapped and taking advantage of and the whole country knows this was the shining star in elisabeth moss career she is incredible each season is better than the one before highly recommend my rating imdb
4,somebody up at disney thought that a prequel show based off of a side character in a prequel to star wars would be a good idea the craziest thing is they were right andor tops every other star wars television show in terms of acting writing and cinematography each shot and line of dialogue purposeful and wellpaced diego luna as the titular protagonist does not disappoint but that is not to say he overshadows the other characters and other actors that work alongside him stellan skarsgard genevieve oreiley fiona shaw and andy serkis all have outstanding performances in this politically charged scifi drama
4,i really love this top it looks great under a black tahari suit that i wear to work the neckline looks really nice the only negatives are that its a bit sheer so i have to wear a tank under it and its a little wide it looks fine tucked in or hanging out with jeans for a more casual look id recommend this top especially if you can get it on sale pretty true to size im pounds and a c and the size top fit me nicely
4,i didnt really know what to expect from the witcher having never read the books or played the games but im a big henry cavill fan and saw all the high ratings so i thought id give it a chance and im glad i did because i liked it a lot even more than i thought i would it seems that most of the negative reviews are from people who are either comparing it to the games or books which you shouldnt just take it for what it is or from bots from competing streaming services that rate everything netflix does low they say things like another netflix bomb or something like that even though netflix has had more oscar golden globe emmy etc nominations than any other company on the planet henry cavill is such a great actor and was absolutely brilliant as the lead as was the rest of the cast
4,sporty comfortable and good option to replace jeans however material needs to be ironed i bought these as a nice dressier alternative to jeans on my trip to europe but didnt end up wearing them bc an iron wasnt readily available and the height of my ankle boots made the style look choppy best to wear these with shoes that dont come above ankle
4,hello fellow cooks we love this recipehave been making it since i do have a question i hope someone can help me with the first time i made this it turned out perfectly i have made this many times since but ever since then when i add the cheese at the end it all curdles and separates i have tried adding it when the soup is hot and when it has cooled somewhat still the same result it is still delicious but looks unappetizing i tell my kidsnow grownjust eat it with your eyes closed lol what am i doing wrong after cooking for years it is rather frustrating any suggestions would be so appreciated happy cooking
4,overall a good package at budget pricing
4,this was very good and very easy i added frozen peas i had on hand after tasting it and that made it even better i also thought it needed more salt and would like to try it with garlic like others have said next time i make it but over all very good my husband even liked it but he said could we add some bacon hes a meat person
4,i made it for my husband who is hawaiian he said it was delicious then he gave me his family recipe for huli huli chicken this recipe will be made again
4,the zucchini muffins were okay however it was some of the best icing i have ever tasted the icing was beyond amazing
4,when hbo first started making tv shows they could never have fully known the path they would forge to make television shows stand shoulder to shoulder and indeed in some cases head and shoulders above their big screen brethren yellowstone is one of the finest examples of this im a big fan of taylor sheridan and this show only strengthens my appreciation and awe for his writing sicario was an instant favourite of mine while wind river is fantastic too as ever the dialogue he writes here is phenomenal proper heavyweight fayre but not so heavy to the point that youre left with your head spinning after watching one episode too many the cast clearly relishes chewing through scenes with the stuff he writes and who could blame them the cast are heavyweight too ive always been a huge costner fan and to say that this show continues his renaissance as an actor would be very unfair to yellowstone because theres a very valid argument that this is the best work hes ever done perhaps only tying with dances and wyatt earp the latter being one of my alltime favorite movies luke grimes cole hauser kelly reilly and wes bentley all support him perfectly making this one of the best casts in television right now sheridan directs too and needless to say simply a writer he aint he makes full use of the gorgeous sweeping locations at his disposal to really help immerse us in the world of the big ranch this show is not for everyone though it has some dark themes and regularly lays bare the fragility of life the despair of living and the evil men can do to other men that being said its hugely rewarding and more touching family moments serve to cast a beam of light on some of the darker places this show takes us firstrate television
4,really gorgeous dressgreat fabricweight great color style runs one size small i ordered my regular but had to returnhope the works
4,ot looks very small but easy to handle and performance is good but office is not free overall it is good to buy
4,really cute top comfy with just enough flare that it can be dressed up a bit or worn just casual not clingy at allin fact maybe just a tad too flowy around the middle but not so much that it kept me from going back to buy it immediately in a second color i typically wear a large but suspect the arms on the medium might be a tad small if i sized down
4,laptop is good in every aspect except speaker
4,i really like the dress it is cute and comfortable the only problem im having is finding leggings that match the way i want dress will be cute with leggings and boots or sandals in the spring it is very casual
4,i liked this sweaters design i like tunics the sweater is a light weight knitthe sleeves are long i got the green which is lighter than the picture the slit on sides go up about inches from the bottom the sweater is comfy but a shirt is needed under or your love handles will be showing if you have them i also ordered the cream color but it was more brownish than white so i returned it
4,great laptop but speakers could be better
4,i was stoned so need more pot and with this pot it helps with the munchies i must be stoned to give this stuff stars but its quick and easy and may be made of real food but i expect that depends on you definition of real food i just wish i had another pot as have the munchies now must be all the talk of pot
4,after a brilliant first season i was extremely excited to watch the second one to my surprise the second season was a huge letdown watched episodes and even though i lost my interest right after the second episode i pushed myself to watch the other the same recycled things are happening again and again and it feels like there is no character development this show definitely lost its soul for the first season for the second one
4,i love this shirt the quality is great and very soft the length seems a bit short i will only wear it tucked in to a higher waisted skirt the arm holes are tight
4,the first unit i received had the dreaded defect where it would disconnect then reconnect which was super annoying sandisk has a very nice online warranty software in place and since it was a known issue they were speedy with a replacement the new unit works perfectly and provides plenty of space as a manufacture it was nice to be treated as i treat my customers from such a larger company
4,such a nice product performance is very well i like iti recommend to buy this laptop in this price range
4,its good so i wont go there whats missing is there are too many loop holes quinn dont want the photos of who are the new body gaurds if that would have happened then reacher cover will blow from the start agent loose their badges at gun fight lousy agent reacher goes out every night from bed and no one check security is too bad what are the odds reacher never got knock at the door at night when he is out for job sneaking from his bedroom at middle of the night you think person with this security will not bug the rooms its part of the policy for all i know the rooms are wired the first thing you dont trust is your bodygaurd itself am surprised the rooms are not bugged and no one monitoring reachers act and calls out of the place
4,this is a pretty top i like the bird pattern and the asymmetry of the design it is nice that it is a natural fiber linen however the linen is not supersoft against the skin that is typical for linen though with a snugger fitting item such as this tee it may be more noticeable over time
4,the witcher is an amazing tv watching journey just give it a try and you will not regret even a single second of your time this show is truly epic
4,its a very good product but size little smaller
4,the laptop looks good and the bezels are also quite thin but the only problem i faced is its viewing angles they are just pathetic
4,thank goodness i looked at everyones reviews beforehand because i ordered a size up and it fits perfectly i am usually a size but can definitely tell it wouldnt have fit correctly had i ordered a the orange color works well for either a fall dress with leggins or a spring dress by itself i love it
4,i love this series alan ritchson makes a superb reacher very true to lee childs creation unlike the movies the story also seems very true to the book i can hardly wait to watch the rest of season i hope this series continues for a very long time
4,the chicken was very flavorful and tasty i really like the caramelized onions it seemed like they really added a lot to the chicken being we always get the precooked bacon from schwans i couldnt add bacon grease instead i just added a little more oil i also put the dish in the microwave to melt the cheese
4,i bought the extra small and although i love the style and unique color combo its pretty large in the collar area and without the right blouseshirt underneath it makes my neck look really skinny the rest of the coat is true to size longer and straight the design just doesnt have the right balance for me so im sending it back
4,great top for everyday wear runs a little large as i usually for size medium and i bought a small a tiny bit see through but i think i can get away without wearing a tank underneath
4,i loved the color of the top and the faded look but unfortunately had to return it because it was too boxy and just looked frumpy
4,i took this laptop on july now im giving it a rating the overall performance is good as of now till i didnt get any problem because i am using this laptop office purpose battery is averagely above hours will come the design is very good and most comfortable for carrying display some give bad reviews for it is okay one drawback in this laptop is the sound quality of the surrounding areas something is disturbance in speakers and the sound is not audible properly rupees worth v read more
4,the show dive into the true motives of each character they find ways to make you angry at them while also have a sense of what they are going through very emotional with the development of each character as well the development does take a while until you start to fall in love with each character because through each season there is a new cast and it takes time to character build even the side characters have something to do with the conclusion of the show jennifer coolidge should win an emmy once again in overall very great show that has lots of different storylines that line up in the end
4,i ordered this dress to wear for a rehearsal dinner i almost consistently wear a medium in most clothing but for this picked the large because of my height i was for sure it would be too short in any other size when i put it on i was drowning in it i would definitely order the small if i had the time before the rehearsal has the potential to be super cute and flattering yet the timing and sizing didnt work out definitely give this one a try
4,its a memory card what else is there to say this is a class so it reads and writes files very quickly
4,simple oldfashioned delicious cake would be great to use for strawberry shortcake as others have mentioned somewhat reminiscent of a good twinkie sponge
4,the print and detail on this dress are so much better in person especially the neckline i agree with the previous reviewer in that it felt springtimey to me flattering fit and flare however the top runs extremely small i am usually a in retailer dresses and i could barely zip the over my bust but the was enormous rest of the dress fit fine but if you are large up top you might want to size up fabric does not stretch overall too cute to pass up for reference i am a dd
4,great product at this price
4,very cute love the animals on it especially the bunnies however not sure about fit fits perfectly at waist but fabric expands a bit further down it seems to billowpuffbag in lower part not at bottom but in the stomach area like there is too much fabric so it fits but also looks like theres something slightly off interested in hearing others opinions about this also i am slightly und ft thereno petite option but the standard stops slightly above my knees so length seems ok
4,laptop is good with this price but speaker is not good
4,i ordered the black not yet available through my store as the xs was too big and we tried ordering xs petite but it was not yet available so we ordered xxs i am lbs it fits nicely but as mentioned in previous review it is thin not see through in black but thin cut is nice though i still think petite would fit me better i n length but xxs was good got a think if i will keep or not as htis is a nice summer basic
4,bought this to use in my inch onda tablet no problems or issues installing or using have about three months would recommend to others
4,love this easy to dress up and down has a great length on the torso but the sleeves are about inches from my wrist bone i see why the model has them pushedrolled up which is how i wear the shirt now too but then its hard to layer under a coat
4,battery backup should have been better at this price
4,first impression is awesome build quality is out of battery performance is quite good display is awesome pros nice display better build quality than any other laptops in this range even you cant differentiate macbook in build quality slim as macbook even much slim than macbook touchpad experience is nice charger is also better than any other laptop chargers in this range cons you cant open up display by one finger if you setup brightness to read more
4,i am not a massive fan of star wars and i never understood why people love it so much that being said i love the mandalorian i seen someone post a review saying it has a video game plot then continued to spew nonsense that each episode felt like a sidequest each with the same plot protect the kid this person clearly is not understanding the plot the plot is for the mandalorian to find a jedi in a universe where seemingly only a few still exist all while protecting the kid from being hunted by the empire who are constantly on their tail its an impossible mission which the mandalorian has taken upon himself resulting in him travelling planet to planet helping people with their troubles building friendships questioning his mandalorian ways and bonding with baby yoda overall its a decent show and it is moving along at a great pace the acting storyline characters production values etc are all great each episode feels like a short movie in terms of production quality you will be pleasantly surprised if you give it a try
4,my husband and i had this with a big pot of ham and beans it adjust enough sweetness it is a big recipex so next time ill probably cut in half it tasted really good with the beans on the coldest night this year
4,a propaganda not daring to target the right group the show literally upset my stomach each time when i watch it three episodes is the maximum i can stand physically and mentally its such an insult to human intelligence and value with the fact that it won so many awards i have to say the people deserve a society like that then
4,enjoyed the first season a little unbelievable but knew that going in liked the light comedy very entertaining series looking forward to season
4,i had the priviledge of trying this on during the off tops sale too bad but the store only had regualr sizes and xs was the smallest i am not super tiny read have muscles but this looked huge on me love the colros and textures though the line in the back is pretty and adds charm when you turn around and the combo of all the colros is awesome but i would need a xxs or perhaps a petite though it is short so not sure about petite soft but try a smaller size
4,very good configuration for domestic purpose
4,i think the only reason this is getting high reviews is because it was hyped up so much the acting was horrible it was like disney acting enid said something like this kittys got claws i dont really remember not do i want to most actingscrip was sadly very poor other than that mostly everything else was good other than the thing in the woods which is in ep to be honest it felt like i was watching a disney show and i almost forgot i was watching a netflix original im not hating on some of the actors themselves because im sure with a better script it couldve been better anyways if you like disney shows i recommend if not i personally think its a wast of time im not hating or trying to be rude but its just my opinion and i really dont understand how a show like this has good ratings
4,i love the material flow of the bottom half of this dress it fits like a charm for reference i am a the size was spot on that being said i was a little disappointed by the top portion of the dress the dolman sleeve seems odd the faux wrap is gaping doesnt seem to clip in the right spot sloppy not like on the model the dress would be perfect as a full sleeve a little snugger of a wrap i could alter the top but the material just wouldnt lay right to the waist
4,charging time to late no fast charges
4,fits true to size looks great just wish it was a tad longer but i am so
4,ive been searching for the perfect gray cardigan and i knew i had to have this one unfortunately the first cardigan i received had two obvious pulled threads so i returned it i took a chance and ordered the cardigan again and im so glad i did it is so comfy and goes with everything my only concern is how it will hold up as it is already showing some fuzziness after two wears if this makes it to the sale price i would highly recommend
4,great dress can be styled up or down for more casual look it ran a bit large for me especially up top the armholes were droopy unfortunately i ordered the s but returned the xs will hopefully be better for reference im usually a s lb
4,good performance display quality is good very good but battery performance as very low
4,retailer sizes are all over the place i fell in love with this top and tried it a couple of times to see if it would work unfortunately i have to send it back the design and colors are very good the side slits are very high right up to the waist but the top still looks good unfortunately it is very small it still fits because of the long side slits and is not that tight at the top due to sleeveless but the fit just wasnt as flattering it does seem to run sizes small so i a
4,i recommend zooming in on the fabric as there are like ink streaks on it which at first i thought was a flaw but it is clearly shownand is actually a nice touch to make these different the fit is true to size or a tiny bit small if you are curvy in the hips i wear a and the l is fine but i wouldnt want them any smaller super lightweight the piping detail on the sides is really cute
4,decent size bottle with a firm lid the smell is subtle but quite nice and the gel is firm enough to wash with
4,i am rating this product with stars simply because i have yet to learn if my samsung galaxy note ii purchased on is causing defective and reformat messages to ocassionally appear on screen or this sandisk ultra gb microsdhc class uhs memory card mbs with adapter sdsdquagua is culprit however i have yet to loose anything stored on this card otherwise if the messages did not appear andor i learn for sure it is a phone problem i would rate this card with stars
4,i watched the first season and was impressed not only by the acting which was worthy of every award going but the way it stuck to the story given the time period when it was written it seemed in point today with the invasion of the religion of peace and its keen disrespect for women and gay people to be honest is not hard to draw comparisons now im into season none of which was penned by the original author and by the second episode we are already into a gay rights romp the point about the unfairness and downright ugliness this new world visits upon gay people is made very clear in the first season along with all women are victims and all men are bstards the first season can be forgiven for all of this because at the time of writing in todays full on in your face enforced respect for gay people didnt exist so the story served to show how ugly humanity could become if pushed in the wrong direction now a whole episode has been devoted to gay rights i have to wonder what is next above and beyond all of that season seems to excellently promote the same morbid atmosphere that season one had hopefully todays politics will stay out of the rest of it and it will be just as good on a footnote for gay people who feel its a good idea to wave welcome banners at a particular ideology this show offers insight into what you could be welcoming
4,i loved the color and the style of the sleeves it was a bit too short on me and i thought it made me look boxy so i didnt end up keeping it
4,i have made a similar cookie for years but lost my old recipe these were actually softer than my recipe which i like i did reduce the sugar to cup i reduce the sugar in almost all recipes increased the flour to cups and they came out perfect in texture and sweetness next time i would add a bit more spice but otherwise very good
4,the source material by atwood was a mere pages the first season of this show was a brilliant adaptation of her work the continuation into seasons and feels forced similar to got when the source material runs out the plot grinds to a halt and the show becomes unidimensional and repetitive if i have to endure another longing stare of scorn and disgust from elizabeth moss i might just gouge my eyes out although the political undertones of the show may appear to be on the surface relatable the show fails to explain the giant leaps in logic and relies too heavily on the rhetoric that the religious right is trying to drag us back to the middle ages the men of giliad are basically straw men with not a hint of moral complexity we get it the patriarchy is evil and women have been victims up until about years ago this show is about as depressing as my facebook newsfeed during election season i think this shouldve been a one and done miniseries
4,the laptop is very good under k but battery is on weaker side other than that aal is good
4,everything went well
4,good performance except battery backup and build quality
4,the critics were incredibly lazy reviewing this show
4,great performances by the actors especially cilian and tom good atmosphere overall good but contains some unnecessary cringy scenes
4,as far as endorsement goes my friend slim donovan would hate this series which means its awesome and everyone else will love it slim likes some weird stuff including a series about some french pastry chefs he smokes a lot of pot though and is also into goat yoga and foam parties i think he was a bit more normal before moving to california as far as endorsement goes my friend slim donovan would hate this series which means its awesome and everyone else will love it slim likes some weird stuff including a series about some french pastry chefs he smokes a lot of pot though and is also into goat yoga and foam parties i think he was a bit more normal before moving to california
4,i dont hate it but its way over hyped its exactly what youd expect without delivering anything you would have expected ok its not trying to be a gory show like the walking dead and that is what i actually like about this show but im not sold on the girl now ive never played the games so i dont know what really to compare it too but shes not it too many cuss words dial that back a lot please otherwise because its not a gore show she has to talk tough to sell her character and talk is cheap i could easily have not watched episode it was the longest episode that added very little to the story i dont have a problem with filler episodes showing other peoples stories i wish they did more of that with the walking dead their story is ok i did not mind it but they did not have to show us things i did not care to see they could have cut the intimate scenes out and id be ok with their relationship they could have trimmed that show to normal length and it would be better all in all i will continue watching the series but there is nothing here i find worth watching again one time watch
4,good for gaming but its battery is drained too quickly when we do our regular tasks
4,i made this and my family devoured it only substitutions because of what i had on hand were chicken tenders for turkey fire roasted diced tomatoes gave a little extra kick and home made veggie broth that i had frozen previously in place of the chicken broth this is a great tasting soupstew and i will be making it again
4,but i thought this was lace or with texture it is more a pattern on regular fabric colors are nice there are subtle flowers with bright colors in the pattern the fit is nice the p fit snugly enough i dont think there was much give but that was comfortable enough petite length did end below the knee as shown i think it would have been nicer shorter but dont want to have to pay extra to ehm so i left that one behindmaybe on sale
4,the series was slow many times i found myself looking at my phone and trying to catch some of the information afterwards everything strolls towards the final episode of each season where you have a glimmer of hope that some excitement will wake you up the shining light is cillian murphy even though hes fairly dead inside the coolness and calmness along with facial expressions when a plan is coming together get you giggling with anticipation im glad i watched it finally but did it thrill me to the edge of my seat no you will get bored with this you will seek closure and frankly when the closure comes it leaves too many doors open for sequels films whatever you want to call it either way they try and touch the audiences sensitive side and spiritual side but miss the mark substantially you will find yourself leaving the series for a little and coming back to pass time
4,this looks exactly as shown in the photo you can tell that its a really thin lightweight knit thats almost transparent i ordered a large and it fits the way it does on the model am returning because i have a large g bust and this top really emphasized my chest it also grabs a bit under the arms the color looks just like it does in the photos it hangs nicely and isnt oversized which i liked the texture and ribbing on the sleeves hem and pocket take this a step up from the ordinar
4,does anyone know if this can be made ahead and frozen it is delicious and id like to have it in the freezer for unexpected company
4,really love it soft and nice quality only complaint is the straps are too long for a normal sized torso the front drapes below my breasts at the tightest smallest setting
4,i rarely write reviews on here but this coat deserves a mention i have wanted a trench coat for a long time but my build and coloring are not flattered by the traditional beigekhaki coat or cut i leapt when i saw this one and immediately ran to my local store to try it on it is not really a rain coat but more like a charming layer in the style of a coat its lightweight soft fabric that swings really well but also gets slightly wrinkly the color is lovely and the buttons are
4,this is dress is great for an occasion such as a wedding i wanted to keep this dress for such occasion but there were drawbacks i ordered the dress online and when i opened the package there it had some sort of oilpetroleum based product smell the other drawback is the hips it just flared out more than i wanted i think that a belt would have solved that but i usually dont find belts in my size as for the fit it is true to size im a true petite and the p fit great
4,lot of potatoes and potato taste in this recipe almost tastes like a hashbrown casserole
4,made this in a bundt pan and other then not baking for as long as in a bread pan it came out very good easy and yummy
4,good to use value for money
4,purchased this a few months ago and the product is still working well i havent had any data loss or other issues
4,i couldnt agree more with that first review i would add that it does run largethe leg holes are big beautiful flower watercolor design as it shows in the picture soft fabric and thin elastic waist band no fake string tightener or buttons simple and romantic yet still a good sleep short to prance around the house in
4,knew from the start this recipe needed to be doubled added lb chickenbeef meatballs sliced in half plus about c petite mixed frozen vegetables mins before serving along with a whole wheat hard roll nummy nummy in my tummy
4,seasons are great with an interesting plot and action is just lame there are a lot of silly useless side characters that need to just die off its obvious this show needs to end soon but theyre just dragging it out as others have said it feels like theyve abandoned the series for and trying to hook people on buying another streaming service edit beth ruining this show shes unlikable in every way and so over the top its ridiculous no one would listen to a person that insane ive gotten to the point i just hope someone kills her off
4,this is a beautiful dress with gorgeous details but it is not as long as it appears in the photo i am and ordered an xl the dress comes just below my knees
4,i would have loved this dress if the bust and waist were just a little more fitted i am c and the top was too big fit perfectly on hips the lace material means it cannot be easily altered so i chose to return the dress i would have definitely kept it if it were a better fit
4,satisfied with the product
4,this is my first try at pumpkin bread i looked over the reviews before starting and im glad i took the advice of using the whole can of pumpkin and omitting the water it came out perfect i used a glass bread pan and it took minutes just like the recipe stated i forgot to add walnuts i think it would be yummy with some spreadable cream cheese
4,you will need to get these pants hemmed if you are not six foot tall as they are quite long but they are so cute that the extra alteration expense is worth it imagine wearing pants that feel like pajamas but that look like a million bucks is this not every womans fashion fantasy
4,the extra room on my phone is great but ive noticed since installing it that its a lil slow when transferring files from my phone to the card its not like im sitting there forever but its a noticeable difference between my old card and this one
4,this show is one of the best on air right now only thing that rivals it is animal kingdom costner is playing a role he was born and seasoned for he makes what would probably a below average show a master piece for the most part the pacing and thrills are on time and excellent and the story is constantly moving forward and always in a direction that pays off if you arent watching this you are missing out
4,delicious and quick watch for bags of frozen peeled deveined shrimp to go on sale if youre landlocked like me agree with use of some red pepper flakes for heat but add into the oil to flavor it can use white wine in place of lemon juice or combination of the two add a little bit of the pasta water to make more sauce without adding extra fat
4,the story line is so gripping and the acting is amazing elizabeth moss is out of this world talented
4,there are good parts and bad parts there is soooo much bad acting in this series the mandatory check the box diversity look at me i dont shave my armpits black female actor is made even less tolerable by her horrible acting the adams family name put on this seems to only really be for clout to get attention and the nostalgic viewers just a basic ya supernatural series i would say if you have the time to watch it its ok if you have other shows you wish to watch watch those first and now apparently that all wasnt enough so heres a bit of filler bad acting bad acting bad acting
4,an ideal lenovo product you can expect at this price point
4,alan ritchson is as good as i thought jack reacher would be all jacked up funny badass a must watch this no disrespect to tom cruises portrayal of the character but this is awesome the action sequence as good as they get
4,if the reviewer thinks this is vile then it isnt a review is it its a recipe that is a treat not something one would prepare every day its like a loaded baked potato on a grand scale perhaps the person who thinks this is vile should go to a more mundane food websiteone for people who are afraid of food its all in how moderate you are btw my preference was to cut back a little on the sour cream and cheese i eliminated the mozzarella and used cheddar and jack added a little garlic powder and chives it was great with steak tips and green beans with mushrooms this is a bona fide review because i actually made it
4,i hadnt played the last of us in such a long time years so when my son and i started watching the last of us we decided to play the video game again if you havent played the game before and you wanted to i think this show might put you off or be very confusing it absolutely does not stick to the source material not the worst thing in the world but tlou game has so many wonderful stories they didnt need to add my main complaint and it seems to be a recurring themewhy did they change ellie in the game ellie is tough kind strong witty and a little rough around the edges overall very likable a fun character to play and root for in the showoh my gosh she is so unlikable she is the one character i wish would get turned into a zombie or de ellie is so rude brash irritating grating unsympathetic brat i also dont understand why bella was chosen to play ellie she looks nothing like ellie and doesnt have the acting chops to pull her off i wanted so badly to love this series and my son loves watching it and wants me to watch with him but elliebella make this show almost unwatchable i dont think this show is a complete skip but it could be so much better i hope the writers are taking notes of the critiques help ellie be more likable as she is in the game i might have given this a or but i really dont buy all the s saying its perfect stunning or masterpiece game of thrones has a twd breaking bad sopranos and this has an this is not an it could be but not yet
4,its well thought out and for an ideal baby
4,performance is pretty good it is fast enough to handle some of the mid range heavy application like games heavy software etc very easilyalongside its battery backup is as mentioned in specifications provides backup of hour on normal uses depending upon settings and application display is also very good overall experience is very good its a very powerful laptop in this budget just go for it
4,love this shirt it has a femine look with a casual style
4,value for money at this configuration
4,super sweet companion but the mechanics for the abdominal movement is simply annoyingly loud fortunately it can be switched off
4,excellent value for money for those not needing gaming capability robust construction light and compact camera could have been better
4,i made this cake for guests and every one loved iti thought it was easy and good
4,absolutely the best the fluffiest i added only tsp of the baking powder and it turned out perfect i would add another tablespoon of sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla the next time
4,the cumin was a bit overpowering for me but this is the first time i have ever used it my husband and his friend enjoyed it greatly
4,a good deal
4,its amazing the amount of storage we are putting in micro chips these days i use this for my dive camera taking videos and pictures the chip hasnt let me down yet and no errors
4,great period piece with superior acting action suspense the costume set designs are on point with limited cgi background drops however while watching the show cant help to be reminded how several story lines seem similar to sons of anarchy which is an all time favorite of mine
4,i just bought this dress in the store and i absolutely love it except for one thing why are the sleeves on the actual dress so much shorter than the picture with the model i suspect the model has long arms not little trex arms so why does the sleeve hit at the top of her wrist while my lovely dress hits just past my elbow its a mystery was the pictured item not what the store took delivery of anyway still a great dress just trying to figure out if i should add lace or something to ma
4,i ordered this in a large and its a super cute dress but this time the large ran super big i usually wear a so sometimes mediums are too small im going to exchange it for a medium and see if that fits better the beading detail is beautiful but just had too much fabric down below
4,it works in my note smart phone i dont think there is much else you can say about it
4,good deal
4,four stars for overabundance of fat sodium content uninteresting seasoningsthought suggestions might be welcome since soup is basically the same name and the different ingredients could offer some flexibility its such a simple recipe i never thought to submit it thanks chocoholiclady for understanding the comments amp reasoninglessened the attack
4,this dress fits great and is very warm for the winter months
4,wow i never liked gangster tv shows but this is something else with acting like this cinematography music casting make up wardrope it is like candy for the eyes and ears every episode draws you in and you cant let go of the world a layered characher like thommy shelby is something that a something woman can relate to who would have thought first episode of the whole series was a let down and took me a while to pick up the show again but thankfully i did i am now a fan and this is better than a tv show it is like being transported to the era and feelings of the charachers
4,i started watching and i just couldnt stop i rarely watch netflix and stuff but i just loved this so much jenna did an amazing job when playing wednesday one thing i dont like is the love triangle i just think it was very love at first sight and it felt unrealistic i think wednesday would need more time to develop any romantic feelings like this imo wednesday might have more chemistry with enid then with tyler and xaivier aside from that it was amazing and unexpected it also shows wednesdays soft side and how she isnt completely heartless and emotionless binged it days and would recommend
4,i am a small athletic build and typically wear an xsmall in tops naturally in something with a more straight fit and blousy shape an xsmall would be appropriate i ordered it and was super bummed the lace detail made the collar lay funny and the shoulders were too tight i liked the sheer fabric though and the lace details and decided to order a size up i am so glad i did because everything laid like it was supposed to this top is beautiful with a sexy but refined look i plan to dress i
4,ordered this in white it is really nice and sexy but very body hugging and unforgiving perhaps it is my large stomach but it hugs a bit too much for my liking yet i think overall the design is very nice so i am keeping it and hoping i can lose some weight in my tum
4,i just made these for my brunch and theyre really good i added cinnamon to them but i will add chocolate chips to make them even more tasty
4,this top is beautiful in person love the buttons in the back fits a little boxy but i like that style
4,well you can purchase it
4,overall product is good for gaming but battery backup is very low when you are watching movie battery backup around hours and when you are playing game battery backup around mins display is very good keyboard is very good sound is decent overall good product
4,i usually wear a medium in jackets took a chance with the small in this coat it fits well the arms are a bit snug but not too snug beautiful design though biggest disappointment was quality i thought the jacket would be thick and warm its pretty thin will test out warmth soon overall decent purchase would buy again
4,this jacket is a flattering although somewhat boxy it does run large i wear a medium and ordered a small fits perfect looks great with jeans and a tshirt
4,for birth too cute
4,i got the rooster version and the colors are simply gorgeous im not so much into wearing a farm animal image but the colors are just too striking to pass this up the sweater is tts but with a slightly baggy fit i did not find it scratchy
4,season update i enjoyed season three but not as much as i liked season two i think that in the third series there was just too much going on too many side stories i also thought that while paulie was a good villain the big boss was rather weak i think this was the writing rather than the actor i agree with another reviewer who took the view that the first couple of episodes were not the best but that it picked up after that i think this was because there was a lot of script used to set the scenarios and because it was story telling setting it sounded unnatural there was a fair amount of good humour though parts of it were borrowed from other sources including seinfeld season two update my review below relates to season one which i gave out of i am very impressed with the improvement that has been made with season two which i really enjoyed reacher has lost his goofiness the writing is a whole lot better and it was a very engaging series which i thought was very entertaining so i have bumped up my score to an overall seven for the two series as a standalone i would give season two out of its really good to see a series going uphill like this so well done to the writers crew and actors end of update i liked the main characters there is some good chemistry but the dialogue is unnatural and often facile and so i had to stop watching as it was diminishing my iq the reacher character really reminds me of elaines on and off beau in seinfeld the one who she cant help being drawn to even though he is not terribly bright it was therefore rather bizarre when reacher was making remarkable deductions with almost supernatural insight as his face like elaines beau has a default expression of i really dont have a clue whats going on
4,mom loves these and she looks great going to the gym the cutouts are so cute
4,it is a very nice and soft teddy ideal for a baby i liked everything especially the sounds and songs
4,i love this top because the gold dots add a bit of bling to your otherwise average slouchy tshirt i didnt notice that the dots are actually distressed until i got the shirt and then looked closer at the online pictures worry not they are supposed to be that way and do not peel off the sizing is a bit odd but i assumed that it corresponded to xssml so i ordered my usual xs size and it worked out just right im giving this shirt an overall of stars instead of because this shirt
4,excellent flavor i had to bake minutes extra
4,not bad but my suggestion please purchase hp product my opinion hp is more better performance and very good looking my old laptop hp and satisfied hp product
4,the otter is very nice and with its various functions light music movements very individually adaptable to the preferences of the baby the volume is also very well adjustable only small disadvantage is the weight of the otter our rating stars
4,like the idea but the tee was was very boxy i tried the size small and it fit at the shoulders but the body was very big i would say they pinned it for the product photo im ausually a size small it was soft and fun but a no for me at this price
4,it actually is a pretty good tshirt but i wish that i had known that white actually means oatmeal with bits of grey and beige i bought three and will now need to return them all hopefully i can find it in other colors i like
4,i love horseradish but family doesnt i mixed c horseradish sauce with c mayo i think it needs horseradish i put horseradish on the table and we who loves it added more i dont prefer the sweet hawaiian rolls but i did use them as they are the rage and seems everyone loves them
4,really good quick recipe i used diced tomatoes instead of the stewed and substituted salsa for the ranch seasoning i served it with crispy tortilla strips and shredded cheese
4,i loved the look of these jeanssuper cutehowever they were way too tight i ordered my usual size they dont fit like a darker pair of serif jeans i own back they go id be curious if anyone else found these to run smaller
4,i have these pants in navy and theyre amazing i cuff the hem in half and they look like joggers theyre ridiculously comfortable and tts but are not very thick so im pretty sure ivory would be see through especially if you wear them during practice
4,this is a very cute dress that i did not keep mainly because i did not like the neckline on me if it had been different i probably would have kept it i liked the fabric the top is a little thin but i did not think it was sheer the bottom part is sheer but there is a lining it drapes beautifully it is a little like a maternity dress but not enough to dissuade me
4,the lace detail is very classy a great go to white dress
4,overall product is good except display
4,i got this shirt in light blue i absolutely love it i just bought it for the summer and i wore it on a day where it was and it was just perfect it is a very light material and its very flowy so it breathes very well i got an xs i am and it fits just perfectly highly recommend
4,fast delivery
4,enjoyed every minute of this masterpiece the writing the acting even the haircuts were original and fresh i shall miss it dearly and hope another one comes to fill the void
4,fit was very tts it looks more lightweight in the photo than it is in person its a fairly medium weight sweater im and curvy and it is nowhere near as long on me in the front as it is on the model i still liked the look mostly because of the look from the back of the shirt
4,this sweater is heavier and has more of a swing shape to it than i had expected but it is fitted enough at the top that it still fit the bill the pink is woven with a taupey color and the effect is great almost a little retro
4,nice for this segment
4,am i understanding that i am supposed to let the dough rise twice as the directions say in step and also in step so far this has been a very simple and easy recipe to follow for this first time bread baker
4,the cake is wonderful the frosting is a mess next time i will make cream cheese or buttercream frosting and add diced strawberries to it to it
4,i usually wear a in maeve and purchased this is a in the orange im just over c size jeans through the bust and arms the fits great i still found the front to be just a tad shorter than i am comfortable it hangs well though if not a bit loose definitely more billowy and boxy feeling in person i think if it were slightly fitted through the waist the length wouldnt be an issue and it isnt even that much of an issue but i did knock off a star for that reason i bo
4,the peachy color read as pretty gold on me which i think was good for my pale skin and sandy hair the lavender accent color is also very nice forgiving fit elegant fabric pretty print respectable hemline super flattering neckline love the pockets all in all i think this dress is a nice choice for day events
4,the design is stunning the color is universally superflattering its a lovely top so much so that i tried it on even though it was pricey but the armholes are huge you can see it on the model who is definitely not wearing a bra on me there was a lot of side bra exposure if theyd had smaller sizes at the berkeley store i wouldve given them a shot but my true size was a really poor fit
4,this is a setitandforgetit item solid performance without issues i forgot it is still in my sony camera love it
4,i should have known to size up since that is what i usually do for skinny jeans ordered a size should have done good quality denim just too tight in the legs for my taste i debated trying a bigger size but decided i just dont love the distressed look on me although i love that they offer highrise petites for reference lbs curvy on bottom usually a size for pants
4,im using this for one week it was super in the performance and speed batteryhoursthis was dissatisfied but charges quickly processoramd ryzen was so good stylelooks very smart and unique displaymultiple views not available only in straight view with good fhd resolution the hp laptop overall good for coding and tasks
4,first season second season third season for reference i am a fan of star wars franchise not the biggestmore dedicated fan though i havent watched the clone wars neither the bad batch i mean i love the first and the second trilogy i dont even remember the last one i think the book of boba fett was very good and underrated and obiwan kenobi tv series was entertaining but a bit underwhelming as well so if you strongly disagree there is no reason to read this review to be honest i dont remember well the first two seasons judging by my given rating i considered the first as a masterpiece for sure it reminded me star wars greatness a greatness which had been affected negatively due to the last disappointing trilogy the second season was great too slightly worse though still i felt goosebumbs watching the last episode third season is not universally loved as i can tell but i liked it a lot as well i agree it doesnt match the greatness of the first two seasons nevertheless there were many amazing moments and the magic is still there even though it wore off a bit i still love grogu i believe pascal is still awesome and bkatans character is a very good addition as i can understand they are headed into a new direction and the next season is gonna be epic third season was somewhat transitional so i dont mind it slowed a bit its flawed esposito is not as great as i expected to my surprise but overall i was satisfied i have spoken
4,i have never liked the addams family in any form i hate the character of gomez so when he is a central character i just cant hang with it i also didnt care for its brand of camp im a middleaged man so im not exactly in the middle of the target market i like still like it all the fawning over jenna ortegas acting is not hype she is very very good the rest of the cast is not perfect but no one outright sucks perhaps my heretofore dislike of previous iterations cleaned the slate for me to enjoy this one if youre coming to this to find another stab at something theyve done before rewatch your favorites if youre open to something new give this a shot
4,the white lotus is a luxury resort in hawaii a new group of guests has just arrived theres the newlyweds the family husband wife teenaged daughter and friend teenaged son and the solo middleaged holidayer little do they know but their idyllic holiday will be marred by a tragedy i wasnt entirely sure what to expect with this series on face value it seems intriguing enough and the high imdb rating made me think its worth a watch after watching the first season im wondering how on earth it got such a high rating it started very badly with a weak irritating first episode we are introduced to the main characters and almost everyone is incredibly irritating the spoiledbrat daughter and friend the vacuous alwaysstaringatphone son the overcontrolling celebrity mother the paranoid father the hyperanxious highmaintenance morose solo woman the newlywed guy who is always looking for faults the only likeable character among the guests is rachel patton alexandra daddario but she too has her flaws some of the characters do have a positive arc but for the most part theyre quite unengaging any time tanya mcquoid jennifer coolidge was in a scene i felt the urge to reach for the remote and fast forward the plot is largely quite dull too even once things start to develop i largely had a so what reaction to events there are some semidecent subplots though its not without its positives though the resort manager armond murray bartlett is easily the most colourful character and pretty much the only character preventing this from being an ordeal there are some good moments of humour though these are few and far between the cinematography and settings are fantastic especially in k resolution overall its not terrible but its not good either i struggled to decide between a or a before deciding that i liked it slightly more than i disliked it so gave it a
4,pthese were great they have a strong banana flavour which we love i used mashed bananas and halved the frosting recipe as suggested by another reviewer the frosting was still very sweet i will make this again and sometimes without the frostingp
4,great first season season two is just torture both literally and figuratively the actress is good but her character begins to act completely unrealistically in a story like this one from there and the fact that the authors love to add over the top sadism in their story it begins to be difficult to watch
4,i was given this product to review think its a very good booster my skin is lovely soft any dry flaky patches have disappeared
4,needed an inexpensive sd card for my new htc one m and this was a perfect choice works perfectly and thus far have no issues at al with it
4,just made this tasty soup with the addition of dijon mustard and a small potato very satisfying with warm crusty bread
4,heat issue happened
4,its a bit difficult to cut as it has to be just right at room temperature to cut but the taste is awesome ill definitely add this to my candy recipe box
4,really cute version of a sweatshirt fits true to size through the shoulders and bust line however since i am larger in the bust area than the hip the lower half of the top looks slightly large on my body the sweatshirt is cut very straight so it would probably flatter a person with a pear or straight shape the inside material of the sweatshirt is a little rough however the appliquã design makes this shirt a keeper
4,this suit is so beautiful and the quality is great i wanted it to work out but unfortunately my chest size is not compatible with this bathing suit i am a c and there is zero support which i assumed when i ordered it but it was so lovely in the photo i had to give it a try for those who have a smaller bust or are more comfortable with a little sexy side profile this may be perfect i ordered the large and the bottoms were a good fit i am also very petite and the length was good one
4,i have been using it for like month no overall good product but battery life is bit short
4,really pretty but runs at least a full size small
4,the first time i made this for my mom and she loved it my brother had some and loved it too i just made some for myself and i added half a pack of banana cream pudding mix to make it even more moist and smooth i love my revised version
4,i loved the first and second season of the white lotus the pacing was nice the mood was beautifully set with music and mythology i loved the characters and their stories and there was stuff happening the third season however has a pacing issue in my opinion right now i am on the second episode and both episodes were very very boring most of the characters are really unlikable the characters that were unlikable in the first two seasons were at least fun the ones in the rd season are just unlikable and have no redeeming qualities i hope something good happens in the third episode because i am slowly loosing my patience also i have a complaint about the theme song loved the first two iterations in the previous seasons but this one isnt as good at all i would rate the first seasons with an and this season with a if the season gets better i will come back and edit this review if notyou will know
4,i mean its obvious lies this whole gb thing you get maybe if you are luckyseems to work ok so far
4,dont get me wrong i have enjoyed both seasons of this but it simply does not live up to the hype as per my title its good but not great i find it predictable and formulaic almost childlike in its writing each episode follows exactly the same pattern even both seasons have i predicted a certain event in se half way through the season having said that it is true to star wars maybe they could have moved it on though maybe im overdoing it but the lack of ability of stormtroopers is simply starting to annoy me and their armour they could do with a good union i will watch season but so far it does not warrant a rewatching like some seriously quality scifi such as the expanse or battlestar galatica edit i wrote the above half way through se a tad early as it turns out im not changing the above as it is still correct but the last minutes of season were epic superb if only the whole thing was like this it would be very good
4,super soft and colors are great i got the navy and plan to wear with white jeans and platforms similar to the photo would also look great with black skinny pants worth it for the sale price
4,not much to saybought it to use with my smartphone it works as expected and allowed me to free up my internal memory
4,everything is good good processor fingerprint but there is no keyboard light
4,problems confusing plot underdeveloped characters despite lots of screen time bag cgi especially rare species the one with dragons very bad the dragon was talking but his mouth wasnt moving if the series wants to be in the same league as got they need to work on the cgi department non linear timeline unnecessary nude scenes romance or love angle moves way too fast especially that of geralt names and locations of kingdoms this series is very confusing coming from a person who has neither played the games nor read the books and im sure im not alone i hope they will make the plot more simple and less confusing in season henry cavill is truly one of the things that will make me come back for s ohh i heard they are planning on making a prequel series hahaha netflix already milking a series that is only started to find its footing
4,absolutely excellent show great acting great plots all of which really gives us a modern perspective albeit fictional classic western narrative i love the diversity of thought particularly the indigenous peoples rationale for fighting and the duttons cowboy rationale for fighting which is grounded in hard work and american patriotism i cannot for the life of me understand why people keep complaining about the characters or the implied hidden agenda or this over here or that over there just take a deep breath and enjoy the show its entertainment after all i hate country music but the soundtrack is perfect for this story line
4,i wasnt sure how this would look on but it is very flattering looks great with leggings or jeans i have received many complements
4,feels a bit more tunic than blouse but its a lovely piece all the same
4,after days of usage i can say it is mind blowing laptop superb you can experience very smooth works and it is best for cse students
4,i love the feel of the fabric and design of this dress i look forward to changing the look with cowboy boots or fringed booties i also like the option of wearing it opened over a white tee and jeans worn loose or belted it can be different every time you wear it it does run large so you may want to size down
4,i love this dress from the moment i saw it online and now that it is on sale i ordered it green i do wish the flesh color was a little more pink love the color in person but not as flattering on my pale skin i ordered a different similar dress in teal and purple that oclor was better so fit like a glove i am dd in waist lbs short p length was sexy and overall great flattering fit similarly to other dress i wanted the length of this one however nice slightly above th
4,this is a mini laptop and very handy windows is an additional advantage speed is quite good it is a very good product in this price range i am using it for some time for my presentations and it works very smoothly

4,good easygood staple for a morning brunch
4,good for gaming editing videos and coding but for heavy task gigs of ram is recommended
4,good product with compact design
4,very flavorful i use wine and cup of beef broth in place of the wateri have also used onion soup mix instead of the brown gravy mix
4,actually a super nice thing works well and has a soothing way the mechanical noise of the breathing is a bit louder but is still perfectly fineoverall beautiful product
4,im on season episode before the end of the season i really enjoy the series theres quite a lot of drama i feel like its sort of a telenovela about cowboys theres a lot of life experiences that ive never had the chance to experience and probably never will on the show and its interesting to see it the script is almost perfect i feel like the screenwriter had some beef with monica because her lines sometimes dont completely relate to the situation and maybe its her acting too i do not know her lines are definitely really bad i hope it will get better with the seasons
4,i have used it for light activities ms office apps not for gaming its a verygood laptop but my i boots up faster display is awesome light and easy to carry thanks to the bridge at the bottom but this is not a good travel companion given the large size for the cost does not give a premium feel my previous zenbook felt classier keyboard backlight is almost useless a simple white light would have been so much better vpn services currently does not support arm architec read more
4,im amazed at how going off track from the main star wars storyline has produced arguably better movies and shows sure baby yoda aka grogu is adorable enough to make any warmblooded person fall in love the mandalorian is indispensable watching for anyone who even has a passing interest in star wars and the season two finale was the coup de grace
4,its good but its lagging bit while using multiple tabs in browser
4,i wasnt sure id like the sleeves but they are very cute and just the right length i really like how the top fits and is very flattering
4,love the way this top fits got many compliments on it wish the arm holes were a little closer fit can see the bra peeking out a teensy bit
4,so far havent got any issues im using it to record video with my gopro and it works fine im also considering buying another one for my cellphone
4,i was looking for a navy top to replace an overused navy silk cowlneck that i have been wearing for years this is perfect light versatile and classic
4,this was another unusual choice for a larger busted woman like myself but i couldnt say no to that sweet little back detail ill attack the waist with a cropped jacket for those looking to add volume or flowy fabric youve found your answer and then some
4,the big names in here are jennifer coolidge who was so awesome in best in show and two broke girls molly shannon of course from snl steve zahn from film and television at the open we flash back to the white lotus an exotic resort where something terrible has happened to a honeymoon couple everybody the guests and the employees are all quirky and weird the running gag seems to be that every time the guests want to do something they are unable to for some reason either the equipment is broken or that activity is only available at am dad zahn is sure hes dying of cancer but cant open up to his son who knows something is on dads mind some fun conflicts with the kids theres nowhere for the teenage son to sleep and the two girls seem to have a lovehate relationship and each staff member has their own quicks but youll have to watch for yourself its fun theres a sense of adventure and suspense first season released on hbomax channel i hope they make more written and directed by mike white who is so recognizable from chuck and buck does a lot of stuff with jack black his business partner
4,this dress is attractive but it runs a little small im a small curvy girl who usually wears a this was small in the top and short waisted i wanted to wear it to a recent event and didnt have time to return it for another size
4,i have a curvy figure and have always loved the way pilcro jeans have fit aka plenty of stretch for butt and thighs and small waist i was really excited to try their skinny high waisted version first i dont like the faux whiskering on the jeans i think it makes them look cheap second the fabric had more stretch than im use to for pilcro denim and made them feel low quality i dont think they are terrible i just think i should have been more careful about reading the percentages of
4,value for students
4,one star removed as most of the pieces were cracked
4,i am a baker by trade but when im home i like to use this very simple recipe i do use an egg wash and i reccomend a very light sprinkling of flakey salt it is delicious and beautiful
4,good for daily use battery life is good some features like illuminated keys finger print unlock are missing keypad while good to use doesnt inspire confidence keys are too loose speakers are good boots up pretty quickly as well
4,this blouse is great to wear almost anytime it can easily be dressed up or down depending on the occasion and the accessories it has a bit more volume around the waist then the picture shows but that could be because im bit more well endowed than the model im and size m this shape looks great on my curves without making me look chunky or stout the image makes the color look black but in person the color can pass for a really dark blue in some light the textile of the fabric is
4,very good and quality memory with good functions i received it in record time from the seller and so far i have not had any issues with the memory card
4,normally a and on a fluke i dragged the to the fitting room the hung better that the i have a belly but not much in the hips so this was surprising most things are too tight in the waist denim feels very soft they may not last but its like butter
4,amazing attention grabbing series i really hope for another season this series has action mystery killing and over all put together in a good way some scenes gives me blue mountain state vibes which just made me even more intrigued to watch lets be honest i binged the series in one day
4,best for this budget cores upgrade upto gb ram storage also upgradable feels like mini mac book
4,personally i love cloth and stone this top however sheer is still a nice top to have in my rotation it is thin lightweight and sheer but with a cami or nude bra can be pulled off nicely i did find the top to be tts for me but the sleeves were snug i purchased this on sale with extra percent off so i was justified in getting it
4,cute spring dress fit can be a little challenging if you have a full bust however print is so beautiful the material is soft i liked the puff in the sleeve it made the look more unique
4,true to the verdugo style love the fit stretch but holds shapesuper comfy
4,soup was awesome would definitely make it again i used cup shredded cheddar instead of velvetta i just added it to the butter flour mixture and added the milk too then later i added another cup of cheddar cheese soup was not too salty i actually had to add more salt than what the recipe called for also i would definitely not add the sour cream at all i tried the soup before adding sour cream and it was much better than after
4,so after ordering this dress and trying it on myself i was able to make sense of the previous reviews this dress is constructed very oddly the top seems to have no room for any hips it is a straight construct so if you are like me that has an hourglass shape but has a pair of hips i would size up i bought this in a p and in all colors first off the colors patterns are amazing in person very adorable this fit my ddd bust without any problems and no problems in torso either it was reall
4,i was very nervous about baking a chocolate cake i have had my share of to drybut not this one it was wonderful the only adjustment i used just a little more then a quarter cup of coco powder the color was just right will bake again very very soon
4,a very nice recipe for mac amp cheese it was a little milder than l really like i added slices of chopped bacon and some symbol im sure the leftovers will be wonderful
4,performance is good but sound is a big issue so you need separate speakers battery is ok during normal usage like watching movies and all drains faster during gaming which is obvious
4,the first season was a for me great action story characters production quality it was amazing the second season they started censoring nudity in childish ways using weird camera angles that dont show the full scene in a way that feels wrong or zooming in on the faces just to censor the scene it really grabs your attention in a neggative way and you get the feeling of ok they are censoring in this way in what other ways is the production suffering because of this it was a big disappointment if they would have set the tone differently in the first season this wouldnt be a problem but now it feels like you were treated like an adult and now you are a little kid that cant stand to see a naked body
4,this cardigan is super soft and comfy with nice big pockets and an easy feel i am glad i read the other reviews before i bought it though i usually wear an xl and they are often too small but i ordered a large and even that one is a bit on the generous size but i really like it a lot
4,the overall color of this dress is more buttery white and the pale golden embroidery almost blends intherefore i think the dress benefits from being styled i tried bold colored scarves with fringes and big statement jewelry this dress is more casual with its fringes the jeans like material although softer than cotton as well as the loose pullover style it is easy to dress down with a blue jean jacket casual sandals or even sneakers i have a c chest and the l fits almost too loos
4,i dont really know how to word it but its just amazing
4,this top has a flattering shape the neckline is low but not too low for work and it flares a bit at the bottom my only complaint is that it is short i have a longish torso and this shirt hits right at the top of my pants waistline i just prefer tops to be a bit longer but its still a cute top
4,this recipe gave me a starting point i had a bunch of peppers of many kinds chopped em up used ground turkey i had on hand plus a can of rotel and another of diced tomatoes threw in some clamato juice pretty tasty but i didnt think it went very well with rice which i kept on the side so i can freeze the soup leftovers when i that it out out i may add chili powder and beans as its a good base recipe for chili overall pretty tasty
4,dear buyers this chromebook is very sleek absolutely light in weight ease in grip n carry perfect partner for travelling n experience long battery life things which i have missed is proper day to day work in ms office and touchscreen pros light weight fit in almost all travelling bags having web cam can used for video calling camer seems to be just ohkay ohkay best part is google assistance over voice recognition without any touch speedy boots up cover with rubber type thin read more
4,the power button has some issue other than that it is a great laptop for personal use
4,display battery quality and profamce is good for students i like it the laptop
4,being from a state where beef is whats for dinner my initial reaction to this recipe was less than excitement but the reviews convinced me to give it a try we really liked it a lot i had to thicken it up a little with some cornstarch to suit my chili tastes next time i make it i will add a vegetable like cabbage or corn to increase the textural diversity but overall this is a really good chili and i will make it again
4,love love the print on these but the fit is off i tried on the solid color in this same style and i took my regular size these i needed a the waist seems really small but the bottom leg parts stretch out and are kind of baggy after wear i cant go down a size because the waist was too small on the since i love the print so much it may be tolerable rare for hei hei to fit wonky
4,i cant wait for christmas i will surely prepare this lasagna for dinner with the use of bentilia to substitute the noddles used for healthier christmas eve dinner and of course to enjoy the dinner without hearing the kids complain
4,im glad i red the reviews before ordering and sized down for reference i am and generally a size or m in dresses the small in this piece fits loosely in a flattering way but a medium would have swallowed me otherwise its a great casual piece the material is light and soft and its cute over leggings
4,i love this top very slimming and cool fabric only problem it is very delicate and will snag as a mater of fact mine arrived with a hole in the back im returning for exchange as i love the way the top looks but know i will have to be super careful not to snag the fabric
4,usually id wait for a sale on rayon loungewear but i would have gladly paid more if this was cotton or silk despite the poor fabric the design is light and beautiful with a high quality floral print thats distinctive and elegant i can wear this with a thin strappy slip or a lacy cami bra or with a cardigan jacket and lacy boy shorts an retailer employee wore this chemise under a denim shirtdress and belted the whole outfit togetherit was perfection i purchased size m and my figure is
4,i originally bought this in medium my normal size when it arrived it was absolutely huge like wearing teepee i took it back to the store and re ordered a small in the black and now it fits great this is a great shirt but giving four stars due to the inconvenience
4,nice pic
4,i have to admit that the earlier seasons of this show got me in more but this last season especially after just watching the last ever ep left me cold hence the low score i can only compare it to game of thrones which was great till its last dreadful season not that handmaids was ever game of thrones i think a big part of the problem is having moss as the central character a over rated actress if the ever was one few actors stood out for me except ann dowd who was bloody good as a complicated true believer look the novel had proper soldiers from the south fighting gilead not a few women with knives as unrealistic as they come
4,ok love this top im b and the reg fits perfect on the top half i am going to have the waist taken in because i love the top it is very short i usually need a petite but the regular is just barely long enough i thought it was red and white but it is red and beige great with jeans or navy for work
4,was very concerned when i realized this sd card was not the correct one for go pro but all seems ok at this time
4,this was just as delicious as it was easy i substituted plain greek yogurt for the sour cream i will definitely make it again a little goes a long way very filling
4,i have worn this with skinny jeans and espadrilles untucked and with black linen shorts i also wore tucked in with high waisted slim fit black pants i got compliments on all the looks i think its a fun and cheerful feminine summer top i got mine on sale so i thought was a fair price for what it is wouldnt have paid full retail requires ironing i am a size and and have a small
4,i love the design of this blouse lots of pretty details the slits on the side are high but with a tank underneath its perfect love the length of the sleeves and the modest flattering neckline the only problems so far are that the rhinestones are prone to falling out and snagging other parts of the top so you have to be careful with movements and you cant wear a sweater with it because the rhinestones would snag it a lot even if it loses the rhinestones its still a beautiful blouse
4,this was a hit at thanksgiving everyone loved it i poured only about of the carmel on the pie and i wish i hadnt next time ill use the whole jar
4,ordered my usual size in pilcro jeans but these are on the small side fit is a little small in the waist area dont mean to be crude but the crotch area is on the short side for me legs fit snug i have skinny legs ill have size up to a the twisted seam look is really cute abt too much ice cream lately
4,plenty of reviews here explain why its good in a cinematigraphic of narrative way just one thing to add it doesnt overexplain why this world the creatures that inhabit it and everything else is the way it is the witcher expects its viewers to emerge themselves in this universe with no questions asked and in return they get a satisfactory experience
4,these shorts are really cute but i felt like they were a little too short for me so i ended up returning them and i purchased the dress by the same brand instead
4,cuz bad actress for triss auburn hair blue eyes in the books wtf is this
4,winter is really taking its toll on my skin and this moisturiser has been wonderful it soaks in fast isnt greasy at all and has a really refreshing aloe scent as well it does everything i need to and does it well its water based so probably not best for oily skin but on my normal to dry its doing great im pretty sensitive too but this hasnt caused any problems however it also contains palm oil now palm oil is a brilliant ingredient and does a lot of wonderful things but at the moment its rarely ethically sourced and thats my only issue with this product unilever are a big big player and need to address this issue this review was collected as part of a promotion
4,made it for the first time tonight and really liked it the only thing i will do different the next time is double the sauce and thickener cover the pan for about the first minutes add the cornstarch mix and then leave the pan uncovered for the final minutes that might leave enough sauce to put on rice
4,there just arent that many series that rise to this level of quality fantastic storyline great cinematography awesome soundtrack impeccable character development in a western theme that actually works the acting is top notch the setting is beautiful staged every element is executed with a sharp eye to detail and scenes flow smoothly into each other kevin costner is incredible in the lead role and the supporting actors are every bit as good its one of the few series my husband would actually ask to watch on a nightly basis every person we recommended it to also recommended it to their friends this is truly must see tv
4,i definitely think this may have worked had i tried on a petitesized version for the length i was not at one of the stores with the petites i did feel like at the regular size is just too long i tried a size on with leggings and that didnt look right the size seemed fine b chest lbs maybe if i had a different pair of pants on but the slits up the sides of the shirt made it look not quite right with leggings i kept thinking the shorter size would have helped i really li
4,this is how my husband makes his neighborhood famous cornbread except he substitutes the last four ingredients for a package of jiffy cornbread mix he also only adds three tablespoons of sugar rather than a full cup half a cube of butter one egg teaspoon of oil and it turns out great everyone loves it so easy he also uses whole milk
4,i would take on the world for a face like that ep another knockout the best episode yet although this show in this short span is the single best piece of star wars since the original trilogy n rogue one the week long wait is getting progressively harder every single aspect is so amazing n sticks with you always
4,first pair of mother jeans went with my regular as in my citizenspaigeag and it fits well the waist doenst seem as high as it looks in the model i wish it was the fabric is stretchy and soft it looks the same finishcolor as online a greyish denim i like it
4,i bought this dress online because it looked interesting and on sale for why not i think it looks unassuming on the hanger but on it is fantastic i am pounds d and the fit me perfectly it accentuates the curves without revealing anything will be perfect for fallwinter but am going to wear it to a wedding in june where the bride is a vintage loving person so i think with the right shoes and jewelry it will be perfect
4,i literally finish this in two days the story was brilliant and kept me guessing the whole time im usually one of those people who can figure out mysteries pretty quickly this one took me longer than most jenna ortega is wednesday addams christina ricci has been succeeded by a beautifully dedicated and amazing actress jenna captured everything that we love about wednesday the creepiness black heart and dry humor are all there but it also comes with warm and caring for others some dont like morticia and wednesday not getting along but i think its just a teenager budding heads with her mother just because wednesday and morticia are goth doesnt mean teenage angst wouldnt follow them i think with future seasons well see more kinship between the two and we better get more seasons netflix
4,as a long standing retailer shopper i have seen the beginnings of retailer great quality and detail and somewhat over the years disappointed of quality going down this vest is so my style and executed very well as being fully lined and sewn well hooks to close are substantial the fact the faux fur collar can be removed is a real plus but though the colors are delish the fabric is a bit questionable the one i ordered on line and sent to me is fresh and not petted but looking at the same vest
4,its a good purchase value for money decent specifications as compared to the amount
4,i received the sky color in m online am definetly keeping it as it is beautiful however i wish they had made it a little less wide and more long i am and could totally size down to a s but even at my height it would be too short i like crop tops and waist hitting tops a lot but the shortness on this one just looks like it shrunk in the dryer
4,very hearty chunky soup i made it as stated but used a cup of veggie stock and added a half onion it came out very thick had to add a little extra milk its a great and easy recipe but as others have said bland i added extra salt but still kind of lacked something and i didnt want to be pouring the salt in still great and i cant wait to make again with some herbs and with broccoli too thanks
4,the handmaids tale is a series not to be compared with any series ive seen before the story shows a terrifying future told by amazing actors fabulous camera shots and brilliant artwork the close up filming that had been used in many shots demands top acting to make the audience really feel and with this cast you do not need to worry alhough every part of that is absolutely top notch i can not write this review without mentioning the incredible elisabeth moss she is the heart and soul of the show and she added another delicate pearl to her crown what an absolute brilliant actress this woman is yes the series left me knockout after watching the last scene made me uncomfortable emotional and doubting humanity but what a must see this is
4,i have a hard time with skinny pants due to my muscular thighs but these worked the length on the petite was a tad long but i see on the model hers do a similar thing so perhaps it is meant to be that way would look better with heels for me below
4,this dress was absolutely beautiful in person but it didnt end up working out for me i wear a the fit but i have a g chest and because of that the waistline didnt sit low enough it was just below my bust instead of at my natural waist i really wanted this to work and think it would be great for the right person seemed tts love the detailing
4,love the clean lines the texture and the slight sheen on this skirt which does run a bit large in the waist the online photos are very true to what the fabric looks like it is a stiffer but lightweight fabric so the skirt stands away from the body the quality of the finish is excellent and i really appreciate the hidden zipper and pockets fit runs large in the waist the size i have measures on the top inside of the waistband and i think the model is wearing a size too loose oth
4,using the card in a sandisk sansa clip and it works songs and counting what more is there to say
4,well i am a software developer the laptop heats up really quickly and once it does the device starts to lag
4,season is definitely recommend the game that it is based on is very well written and that transpires in the show as well some moments are changed and they dont make the show worse which shows even the show was made by competent writers zombie scenes are less which is bit bizarre considering the premise of the show but relationship between joel and ellie is done well and acted is competent one criticism i have for season is that it is too short and its difficult to connect with other character if their storyline is finished within one episode season part of the game already had issues with story pacing and attempted some story telling technique that can be an issue while adapting season is extremely poor in comparison to season till th episode will update once the season is over but this season has made some change to character which i think will make show worse going forward
4,this is the best feeling ever when you receive the most awaited product of your life which could wrly change the way of life i have brought this product for my coding journey so just wanna shout out to the coding society and grow with msi
4,here is how tom cruises movie was better better storydeduction better dialoguecomebacks this one wasnt horrible but imo dialogue was bad action very bad not too believable some things they did were kinda weirdmade no sense and i think they were just done for the shocking value roscoe is sweet and i like he accent and dimples but thats about it
4,i have been using this laptop for the last two days there has been no problem with the laptop in these two days this laptop is great for children to study all android apps are running well in it customer support also good india will study india will grow makeinindia
4,i purchased the medium in this sweater as that was all that was left but it fit like a large if not an xlarge its a beautifully made sweater and really soft i now think i know why it suddenly becomes available again here and there its not the kind of sweater you want to wear over sized because as beautifully made as it is its not that flattering if its hanging on you luckily it suddenly became available in a small which i quickly ordered and will keep my figures crossed that its bette
4,deliciousalso used dried porcini sherry nutmeg reg cream
4,arrived quickly and in perfect condition it works well with my camera using its standard size adapter and then is readable by my note seems quick enough for my canon g i would recommend this
4,i am going to review this pretty much the way the person ahead of me reviewed it first the colors are way more vibrant in person than in the photo there is even a lavender which you can sort of see under the yellow stripe it really makes it look different second it is monstrously huge i am pounds and i ordered the xs and it completely swallowed me up because of the vibrancy of the colors it didnt blend well with my fair complexion and also it is like a heavy sweater not a
4,i love this dress for day and night time the back detail is cute and works well with a racerback bra it runs big though im normally a small in dresses and the arm holes are too big in the size small on me it was also generally too big all over i like the length and the weight of the fabric i purchased in the off black color
4,overall i thought this was a very pretty blouse i loved the colors and the design the construction seemed good others mentioned that it ran large but i am tall and often struggle with the shoulders and arms so i purchase my normal size small i believe it is the width in my shoulders that caused the blouse to hang funny you could see a decent amount of the back fabric hanging around the front sides which looked odd it made the front fabric look like it was cut at an angle i am not br
4,super awesome show and cant wait for a season and more great effects and acting only reason i gave a is because it was tough to tell when events were taking place but im assuming it was on purpose all around great show
4,i can honestly say this is better than all the other star wars movies but is closest to the original ss trilogy
4,were not great fans of beans so i put a small can of corn and a grated zucchini in the ground beef mixture instead i didnt use the italian dressing and i used my own version of taco seasoning with garlic powder sweet smoked paprika and ground cayenne pepper i served lettuce tomato and chopped onions salsa and plain yogurt on the side makes it easier to reheat leftovers we all really enjoyed it
4,lets start with the good compelling source material classic zombie apocalypse setting superb production values pedro pascal who delivers a compelling and believable performance now the bad the writing the writing and the writing by far the most tearingmyownhair out catastrophe in this whole production is ellies dialogue no teenage girl talks or acts like this she speaks with the words and cadence of a middleaged smartass american writer during a cocaine binge which is of course the person who wrote her lines but part of basic writing is to write lines that a character would actually say her persona is essentially rdjd tony stark in a teenage girls body its a pathetic hackneyed and transparent attempt to give us an uber cool girlboss character that were supposed to love i doubt many did even if the writing was remotely plausible bella ramsay just does not have that sort of charisma im certain that most people are as bored as i am of this cliche where they make a child character who is supposed to be precocious or wise beyond her years but people like that do exist and none of them would ever talk or act like this its such a failure on the part of the writer because it breaks your suspended disbelief every time which could have been avoided unfortunately thats not the only braindead hollywood cliche that stains this production we also have the classic characters sacrificing themselves for no logical reason whatsoever for a cheap emotional bit characters who are supposedly survivors but stop and gawp without reacting at all whenever lethal danger comes right at them so that they can be conveniently saved at the last moment by a cheap plot connivance and characters running into gunfire to save other characters who arent injured and can walk or run perfectly fine overall the plot spends way too much time going nowhere for poor returns in entertainment value so yeah could have been excellent instead is distinctly average
4,laptop is very good at performance i have run power bi and big excel sheets i dont see lags but when it comes to the battery i can see only hrs of battery after a full charge display brightness also needs to be kept atleast above even using at home sound is also audible but suitable only in a closed room or office shld connect it to bluetooth device in outdoor meetings
4,retailer is known for their unique designs and this one does not fail to disappoint i usually wait for items to go on sale but knew i had to have this one in my collection due to the fact that it can easily be worn with a pair of pants the actual shirt is a bit shimmery which you cant tell by looking at the photo i didnt mind it and thought it was actually a plus i just think it is a bit too expensive because although it is nice quality i dont feel it is worth the price tag pretty
4,this is a very pretty dress the previous reviewers helped a lot when it came to deciding which size to order typically i am a or sometimes a in this dress i ordered a that was the perfect size the coloring is cute unique and very versatile for me it wasnt a keeper because the material was soooo heavy feels like canvas almost if youre looking for a dress to layer under a chunky sweater on a cold day i imagine this would work but for me it was a no
4,so after lot of searching and searching finally i purchased this book i variant since i have a galaxy s a tab sfe plus a galaxy watch classic a galaxy buds i had no other options rather that this galaxy book with all my stated products everyone can now easily guess i have everything on a budget price as such i had no other options rather than the i variant coming to the laptop the only difference is only the processor in all the book and its the cheapest one but th read more

4,im and lbs i ordered this in xsp but it was a lot shorter in the front than led to believe from the photo it was also a little baggy on top otherwise i love the material shimmer and overall look i will be exchanging this for a regular xxs
4,this is an adorable top but it just wasnt my style im and felt silly wearing a big bow but if you can rock this look id recommend it the top is a thin sweatshirt material not a knit sweater or a thick sweatshirt fabric it is a cotton rayon blend the sweatshirt part is cropped but the striped shirt details come to a good length the shirt trim is cotton the fit was true to size it is a bit loose not overly fitted but true to size it nips in a bit at the waist and then flar
4,i absolutely love this top the design and the cut it is very long in the back it is very flattering i would have given it stars except it is see through i wish it didnt need a cami layering tops gets old fast in the hot weather
4,display quality low fast speed for using
4,using this in my samsung g cell phone as a memory card and expansion it works ok for now allthough not the card but the phone itself does have a slight issue with reading massive sd cards at this high compacity i hope that samsung will release a software or firmware update to resolve the issue with reading the card on boot up of the phone sometimes i have found that simply restarting the phone usually resolves the issue with reading the card or any other error messages overall minus the slight issues it works great
4,awesome and budget friendly product got it like i thought powerful cpu upgradable slots ram and upgradable slots ssd battery backup is only hours but supports fast charging aura support keyboard in nos usb and in no thunderbolt support type a usb only thing is that the bezel of the monitor is large on the bottom side of the monitor
4,cute and comfy if you dont throw a leg out like the model above it mostly reads as a skirt because the legs are so full but its really comfortable and pairs well with a surprising number of tops
4,the build quality and design is very good i have been fan of thikpad t series laptops but this e series does not disappoint keyboard experience is almost close to t series overall performance is okay it takes sec to boot which is a bit on slower side cs i could play only in medium to low settings
4,its really good
4,i should have known with the combined sizing but this is very wide even in the xssm its a beautiful sweater a thicker gauge of yarn than it appears to have and the pointelle holes are also larger than they appear it is fairly itchy if you dont mind that just way too big for my small framealmost falling of the shoulders which is not the look i was going for if you want a wide and boxy look or have a larger frame this could be great for you it is pretty and quite unique
4,like another reviewer i was in the store looking for the vest with the faux fur collar and tiewaist it turned out to be too longbulky for my small frame or there wasnt an xs cant recall but i saw this and its just the thing i didnt even know i needed im fairly thin and petite at and drown in most cardigans this is just long enough it was a subtle aline shape fabric is not thick but is substantial enough that its still warm i also like that its hand washable nice to have
4,this show is okay some funny and dramatic moments but overall after all the rave reviews i was somewhat disappointed i decided to binge watch the whole series and kept waiting for something really dramatic to happen the acting was good without being outstanding and the script decent but nothing to write home about
4,nice laptop design was nice its really worth it to buy
4,the otter is visually really very sweet and also feels very cuddly but as some others have pointed out the engine is quite loud and at least not well padded in the back machines washable even only cold possiblei like the settings in themselves and the light is also very pleasantso if you dont mind the buzzing of the engine it is a great toy
4,this is a great lounging dress or a great beach cover up i ordered up a size after reading other reviews although i feel like my normal size would have been fine probably i ordered the black and it is not see through its very light weight and comfortable i may even order in another color just because its so great to wear around the house
4,i used this product almost months overall very good performance in this price
4,lightweight and comfy fabric very flattering on except runs a bit big through the body i normally wear a and a l at most stores but retailer seems to run large on me so i needed to exchange this for a smaller size as the fabric width on the body was just too much
4,first of all i am only so this adorable tunic does fit me like a dress i am also pear shaped and this dress is flattering to my shape but my biggest issue it that the dress came in very wrinkled especially the ruffles i took the dress to my retailer store and they were able to steam some of the wrinkles out but not all of them it seems that the fabric used for the ruffles is suppose to be a little crinkly but it will most likely look worse after you sit therefore i am uncertain
4,i ordered my normal size large and it fit well although a bit on the long side the fabric has a waffle texture thats lightweight but warm and cozy i got the blue and the color was a bit intense in combination with the tie dye affect and waffled texture my favorite part are the lighter striations on the neck that opening is really small it just didnt suit me so i returned but recommend giving it a try if its calling your name
4,im olderand often cant wrap my head around some scifi shows this one was magnificentpulling you in from the very first scene where the fungus specialists are speaking interestingly our entire global eco system is based on fungus it had drama tensionsome really poignant moments and left me looking forward to the next episode with a passion not felt since the game of thrones not that its a similar storybut its captured my imagination fully after the banshee of inisherin i was bit cautious as the hype encouraged me to watch a ghastly film this series cannot be hyped enough to do it justice in my opinion the castthe scenes the cohesive story with glimpsessuggestions of classic scifi books i read years ago the music codes looking forward to hearing more of them id give it stars if i could
4,these run tiny i wear a in pants and took a medium in this bottom and im still not completely comfortable with the fit love the floral print but with a bottom this small you dont really see much of the flowers so on mine at least its just some splashes of different dark colors
4,i got it under k for that price it is steller but the display is little bit low in terms of brightness and colors and speakers are also decent otherwise rest are best
4,this is a true masterpiece ive been binging season whitin a couple of days and i literally cant stop watching the show has a lot of twists turns you wont expect i love everyones performance in this show as well its a dark comedy and ive never seen anything like it i can imagine this show could have infinite seasons and i truly hope they will never stop making new seasons of the white lotus its a pleasure to watch ive not seen a boring episode so far and im starting season today i really love the cinematography and the locations they have used to shoot this series im hoping theyll make a new season in at my favourite island bali one day if not ill continue watching anyway
4,jenna ortega is absolutely amazing in the role her acting makes a solid show outstanding her playing on instrument dance facial expressions adds an additional layer to the show one of the best castings of all time if youve seen her in the role you cant even imagine someone else she has a bright future ahead of her the jokes vibe and atmosphere are particular the story is better than average but it has flaws some had problems with the parents characters but they are more than okay there is little action thriller crime investigation horror comedy and teen romance so everyone can find what they are looking for overall its a unique experience recommended for all ages
4,teenagerish silly cringy in some moments but my general impression is positive the script isnt exactly great i could feel the presence of the writer behind the screen and there were moments where i could see how theyre giving me a dummy answer to the mystery to surprise me afterwards but it didnt really spoil the pleasure cgi is pretty bad but not a deal breaker for me on the good side i personally loved the gothic aesthetics acting is decent the plot is intriguing and may the feminists call me a misogynist objectifying women which im not but having adorable jenna ortega take this much screen time adds to the series
4,love this series and its heavy nod to the books as well as the games always left wanting more nothing will be exact and there will always be people who will find something wrong but if you can see past all that they really have done well with this series i can only hope that there are more seasons to come the witcherverse is vast and really anything could happen henry is just on point as geralt and jaskier has me in fits of giggles yennifer is not exactly what i expected but i have grown to love her too like i said try and look past your prejudice and original expectations and you will see this for what it is an excellent adaptation blending originality and different platforms together
4,performance tagara battery life tagara specially the lucky one for me i recovered my laptop money in just months
4,lolita is a novel written by russianamerican novelist vladimir nabokov nabokov set out to write a beautiful piece of literature but on a subject that was immoral and deplorable the reader is thrown into a state of cognitive dissonance its great novel butbut yellowstone has a similar effect viewers are presented with a stunning aesthetic and seduced by the cowboy myth but the family at the centre of the story are ultimately corrupt vile murderers yet we are expected to sympathise and cheer them on its not unlike another popular series succession but on horseback however while the family in succession are more clearly ugly the duttons and their entourage are held up as a shining example of america as the land of the free and the home of the brave its a terrifically manipulative series
4,i cant imagine a more perfect casting for wednesday the plot is a little hard to follow and people expecting this to be an addams family reboot will not be happy but the show stands on its own its enjoyable and unique and definitely worth the watch if only for ortegas performance the cinematography is beautiful as well everything is catered around wednesday so she stands out in every scene even in a school full of outcasts i especially enjoyed the juxtaposition between wednesday and her bubbly roommate people who enjoyed charlie and the chocolate factory and series of unfortunate events will love this show
4,to get star wars right should not be difficult yet disney movies really struggle with it but the people behind the mandalorian clearly understand what makes it magical well done
4,im lbs have a cd bust the xs fits great i wash everything in cold line dry this was no exception when i took it out of the washer i knew immediately ive pulled it back into shape hung it up but well see dry clean if you want to keep it
4,like the look of this tank ran a bit larger than expected at the neck but overall happy with the purchase
4,i have size feet and these are a bit small the heel doesnt quite make it around my heel to where its supposed to be still theyre comfy and not too thick or too warm i really like the stripes of different patterns good trouser socks i imagine if youre size or these will fit perfectly i got the mint and the pink colors and theyre very true to how they appear on my computer screen
4,design is good and display us also awesome
4,nice for use
4,update after watching the full series well i think overall id give this a or the opening episode was definitely a the rest of the show would be getting either or s depending on how appealing they were to me everything was well made well acted well shot etc the brutality of it all was maintained throughout i watched some of the game footage on you tube and there is a lot here that is identical to the game so thats a plus for fans of the game plus it works for a tv show so kudos to the game makers the story and overlying themes are very simple and relate to parenting and how we protect our children or the young it could have had more cordyceps and more action in places but this was more of a drama surrounding the struggles of a broken world overall ill give it an out of a very good tv show that stays loyal to its source and was very well produced update ill start by saying ive never played the games ive no idea how true to the source it is the first episode was very impressive they told hold back here and emotionally you are involved quite early on the prologue was informative but understated the opening was brilliant and as good as anything you would see in a movie the middle section is good and paced well to provide enough information going forward as to the objective the players and whats happened to the world outside the episode ends at the start of an adventure i hope this quality remains throughout the show so the adventure is as good as the opening a hard act to follow ive enjoyed the characters so far not all likeable but our lead pedro pascal is familiar and trustworthy and does a good job bella ramsey of game of thrones fame plays the female lead i really hated her in game of thrones her acting is a bit less wooden here so i hope i dont end up hating her in this so far she has been fine its only episode but its probably a out of i would be shocked if they can keep up this sort of standard and narrative throughout the series having said that there is plenty of scope for some interesting scenes im not a big fan of zombie films or shows but can find them entertaining i found black summer s brilliant i hope this doesnt turn out to be just another zombie show ep
4,the inseam is advertised as but they are more like i was hoping they were for short people but they are for someone with very long legs event in my tallest heels id have to get them hemmed just a warning to my short friends out there the quality fit look was great but way way way too long
4,everything seems to be good but display was quit low quality overall a good product
4,great show hope they make more seasons there should be more shows like this there fun interesting and different from most shows plenty of thrills and spills along the way this thriller is worth a good watch and more
4,its kind of obvious this story was written by a canadian canada being the heroic saviour land to the north from this perpetually in winter horror zone that used to be the north eastern us ironically this right wing christian fundamentalist cult cares not a jot for the constitution and is more than happy to seize power by force to create a patrician old testament kind of agrarianwithguns society as if what they create is more akin to what you get already in the middle east not coming soon to the mid west i heard a radio interview with ann dowd a few months ago she actually is aunt lydia i think and she seems to have drunk the koolaid on how close the us is right now to the gilead depicted yes yes we know you have you vote democrat or youll never work in this town again but honestly this isnt how conservatives think or what theyre planning for you use your brain enjoy this as an entertainment because it isnt cutting it as a cautionary tale and blame canada
4,so much prettier in person than online the animal print isnt in your face but subtle enough for almost any occasion the buttonup collar and slightly past knee length make it work for a casual work environment the pleats and airiness of the dress remind me of kate middleton in anita dongre fit pounds i bought a six but the four would probably work as well because of the lightness of the fabric the extra fabric doesnt overwhelm my small frame goes slightly past my knee
4,just what was needed a modern day bonanza and dallas rolled into one but far superior superb acting kevin costner at his best cant recommend enough
4,a little pricey for a baby toy but our baby likes the noise and soft light helps keep baby asleep in our noisey house
4,i first saw this on hbo max and thought to myself this might not be good but ill try this show out anyways turns out i have been binge watching this gem of a tv show i enjoy it a lot also it seems a bit different from most shows which is refreshing there is some good humor and serious scenes which i also really enjoy i am not done watching yet but i am more than pleased with what this show has to offer if you have time then give this show a try this will not leave you disappointed and hopefully it will be refreshing to you as well the scenes have been aesthetically pleasurable too
4,lenovo ideapad slim is good but the only thing is display quality is not so good but also not bad because if you visit alot of white color web pages or white products or you have to work with white screens then this laptop with this display quality is not suitable but over all performance is awesome and processor speed is also very good and the design of laptop is premium look and sound quality is also good there is no complaints with the speed and performance and processor overall a read more
4,i wear a jean and the size s in this bikini bottom was just too small in photos it looks so cute but on me it just didnt look like anything special hopefully the larger size has more pizzazz
4,love how easy this is to make but way too sweet at a half a cup of sugar also bake at or like other recipes suggest after mins at center still jiggles
4,great storage for the price per gb the only drawback is that they are rather slow to write to
4,good
4,there were a few episodes i didnt like in both seasons but after finishing up season i can say this show is truly a masterpiece the writing and acting were phenomenal this was an adult story that star wars fans always wanted characters that had many dimensions to them good and evil were blurred as they can be in real life almost all the characters had many different sides to them bad things were done by good characters you felt the pain of many of these characters you felt like the stakes were real appropriate humor as well no your momma jokes or drinking blue milk from alien nipples you felt the weight of the story watching this show brings so much more context to rogue onethe only good disney sw movie a show like this will have lasting impacts on the fanbase we are not toxic as disney always claims we just want a good story with developed characters and no agenda being forced down our collective throats
4,this is an amazing series so far i think this series will be the best series
4,the broth was excellent but it seemed more like a cheesy potato soup than cheeseburger well enjoy this soup anyway and ill make this again but next time ill double the meat and cut back on the potatoes to make it more cheeseburgery
4,i love the slumber otterof course my son toothere are different soundswe always use the music and even i can relax as a mama
4,its a phenomenal wardrobe peice quality comfort versatile dress it up or down belt it or not boots or shoes im ish lbs small fit my d chest beautifully a great buy have fun with it
4,once i figured out the s wasnt liking the exfat file structure and formatted to fat it works quite well i dont know if its the phone or card and im not about to test it elsewhere but i didnt see the mbs speeds it works good enough for the phone and its the best option i have for the biggest storage for nowp videos with no issues no problems with readwrite stability overall im happy i bought it
4,after watching season and with only a few breaks i have to express my fine experience paper thin and scratched story about drifting loving killing thrilling and going the long way they are very lucky our friends and perhaps we have never seen a hero avoiding that many bullets taking that many punches throwing that many back as reacher does somewhere in between the punisher not as sick and terminal list a bit more action loaded the big guytheme kept me from watching the show until now and as must appear i got quite positively surprised even by some of the dialogue reacher sometimes makes real sense i considered to give it a er but the genre doesnt add up to that
4,very smooth performances it has an antiglare display as well hertz
4,high quality top but material is not very soft may soften in the wash fit is okay
4,i just made this for dinner tonight i added two cans of cream of chicken soup and an extra clam juice to it i dont like to use flour if i can help it everything else i did exactly to the recipe i liked it and will make it again thanks
4,very good flavor and super easy to make great for those days you just want to have super ready when you get home from work
4,this top is cute nice fabric and design pretty flattering for such a loose cut my one concern though was that when i was moving the peplum part kept riding up i felt like i would constantly have to readjust the shirt to make sure it was lying flat the shirt runs large im usually a and the was plenty roomy
4,this isnt high art there are goofy jokes and callbacks occasionally its heavy handed it has some questionable police work however its self aware the fight scenes are choice the crew did a great job its an s action romp if youre looking for it to change your life then youre looking in the wrong place
4,i had been admiring this dress for over a year and finally treated myself to it for the holidays first it is gorgeous and very thoughtfully designed to make you look amazing where things fall off the rails for me is the fabric choice for the sleevesthey are sooo delicate and evidently snag far too easily the dress that i received in the mail had two large snags one in each sleeve that were already running a bit to me that was a huge red flag that i shouldnt be spending so much money o
4,looks cute on not super form fitting more of a flow fit love the detailed stitching so cute floral pattern is fun not too busy i loved the pockets there is a bit of extra material but if you expect a flowy fit its still totally lovely i was worried about tightness in the arms but not a problem at all i love this dress lining makes it feel really well made
4,i knew going in that it may not fit a d cup but the fabric is beautiful so i thought id give it a try i wear a d and bought a large its got a clasp in the back so theres no adjustment on how it fits around which for me was too big the triangles did not provide enough coverage left too much side boob the fabric was very pretty in person but thinner than i expected which also made it seem less sturdy sadly have to return and cancel the backordered bottoms i would recommend to someone
4,for homemade mac n cheese this is the best ive tried definitely not dry i agree with the other posters who said the sauce was thick and pasty there was also too much of it for the amount of pasta next time ill use a whole oz package of macaroni cups uncooked and alter the flour and milk as suggested by others to get a thinner sauce
4,good product quality is good one negative is th generation only over all is good
4,overall a good budget laptop
4,like the other reviewers have said this is a wider shirt but the width done is in a stylish way i did not think it looked frumpy or sacklike on however i found it to be rather short i bought a regular not petite and it fits shorter than many shirts i have from retailer madewell etc which have the same looser fit i am lbs so it is odd that it fit somewhat short on meif you are tall it might bare your midriff some i bought the peach which was close to the color pictu
4,love the wine colored cords but i tried them and i was disappointed because my normal size was too small i usually have to size down in pilcro pants but not these im an and the wasnt going to button i love the slight cropped flare and the color did i mention the color but vanity wouldnt allow me to buy them hopefully i just got a mislabeled pair
4,excellent product high performance
4,hp laptop is an excellent budget laptop for general use
4,i ordered a and it fit great i am ft and lbs b in the chest i love the fabric i was drawn to it because i dont think it will wrinkle and crease as easily as other fabrics it is a flattering cut and is very beautiful in person the embroidery makes the dress unique
4,yes this is a beautiful print and fits perfectlybut its unlined thin polyester full price is pretty ludicrous on this one tts but might need to size up if you have a larger chest no stretch hoping to grab on sale
4,i ordered the red motif in size xl for me the fit matches the model so i think its truetosize the only larger area on me is for the armholes i use a cami so my bra wont show when raising my arms since its made of rayonspandex and is a longer length its a little clingy along my hipline for my pearshape but overall its so soft and comfortable the colors in the floral pattern are beautiful prettier in person theres no problem with pattern placement either a great top for summ
4,i debated for awhile about getting this dress being tall i was worried that it would be really short on me so i ended up ordering it in a large im a size it definitely has a blousey look to it which i like i kind of wish i had ordered it in a medium as well but i think the large will work just fine the length is good hits right above my knee the elastic waistband is nice because i can pull it up around my natural waist or pull it down for more of a drop waist effect as o
4,i got this dress in the green in an xs and was a little leary of the fit in light of the previous review however when i tried it on i was impressed how it felt in the upper torso it fit great in the neck arms and shoulders and i didnt find the rest of the dress to be too roomy although it wasnt a snug fit either it came below the knee on me but it didnt bother me that it was slightly longer than in the modeling pics it is a little on the itchy side so it may be best to wear a cami
4,lovely pants incredibly comfy fabric but too short for people stated inseam of is a bit understated but it is clearly not that i need had to take it back to the store
4,season out of stars the second season picks up with a lot of action emotional story fun new characters and surprises story continues where the last ended trying to find the other mandalorians there are some fun new surprises with characters making an appearance also leaving room for more spin offs each episode is action packed and bigger the cast ensemble is great the music score is an improvement and little different baby yoda is fun and is heartwarming also has an emotional ending and a wild battle in the seasons climax while leaving room for more to come
4,there is something wrong in this recipe no way would this be servings of cup each its maybe cups total and thats after i added additional tomato celery and a little extra pasta i dont know about you but my idea of a main dish salad like this with a pound of bacon in it would be more than cup so please investigate and fix this otherwise this had good flavor
4,i grabbed this during a off sale so i will state first that i dont think this top is worth full price and even at off i wasnt wowed enough to pay that much for it the colors are more saturated in person and very pretty however the cut both the length and the width just made it too overwhelming on my size frame i ordered the xl and it was wayyyy too big through the chest but sizing down to a large meant that it didnt flow over my hips as well because its so long i think
4,i bought this for a beach getaway with the purpose of using it as a beach cover up it was great for this purpose however i also bought it thinking that i could use it as a dress during the summer i probably wont be using it for purposes other than the beach as it is extremely light weight and a bit sheer also although its hard to see it in the photo there are slits on the side of the dress all of these elements make it perfect for the beach when you want a breezy lightweight dress bu
4,i am so glad i purchased this top and read the reviews thoroughly i am usually a or medium in tops because of my broad shoulders for reference lbs and athletic build i decided to size down to an the top fits perfect and looks just as pictured it is a bit more substantial then i expected the details and embroidery are beautiful and make this top so uniquely retailer it is casual in an elegant way i will be pairing this with skinny jeans andor white skinny pants i cannot tell
4,i ordered a size xl in the pink version with the multicolored fabric the fit is true to size other than the length it isnt inches its the petite length even though i ordered the regular sizing i ordered a nd one and again the length was around in instead of so it will be more of a swingy shorter top than shown but through the armsbody its truetosize ill be drycleaning this so it wont shrink since i need the length the colors and embroidery are exactly as pict
4,really good deal definitely a good way to save money buying an item with less memory and buying one of these is a lot cheaper
4,some finger print on laptopi think one is the prons
4,this was good i used a oz can of pasta sauce and then added oz of tomato sauce instead of the oz tomato sauce i also used ricotta cheese in place of the cottage cheese as we prefer ricotta i served it with french bread and a tossed green salad
4,glad i went in to buy this in store i was surprised by the texture which was much more cotton almost gauzelike than most cloth stone shirts made with tencel the blue looks like demin online but in person is a rather ugly dark blue the pink was almost red but the yellow was beautiful it is doublelined which is one of the best things about it im usually between a s and m and could have gone either way but choose m because it was a little longer and flowyer
4,the fabric is beautiful the embroidery quite striking and the length is perfect however the dress is a bit amorphous and as others have mentioned the sleeves are silly so i took the dress to my favorite seamstress and she added a couple of darts in the back and fixed the sleeves voila these werent expensive fixes and now the dress is perfect
4,these were easy to mak and very good
4,good machine for students
4,we always hope that the dress looks just like it is pictured i would say that this dress is more of an emerald green rather then a paler mint green that said it is very forgiving stylewise because it does not cling and show your lumps and bumps however the material is very thin like a sheet length is good it is right to the knee on my frame armholes are well positioned and not too big as to show bra or undergarments not so sure how it would hold up over an evening or afternoon wea
4,bought this in cream in my usual xs b lbs it is a very flattering summer weight cardi which will work well with jeans and maxi dresses this summer i would point out however that the sleeves are very snug if you dont have thin arms then you may have to consider sizing up i stuck with the xs even though i had to carefully pull the arms on because the s was just a little looser in the back the sleeves are meant to be form fitting but i think they have been designed a little
4,best show ever love beth and rip they are my favorites next to kevin costner there could be seasons and i would watch them all i havent seen a writer and actor come together this good ever its all you want in one show romance whitdramasuspensecomedy action with twists and turns of betrayal and family intriguing i give this show an out of every actor is right on with getting the message out from the story line that taylor sheridan has wrote i also loved tulsa taylor i believe you will win every movie award being given for best writer this generation has ever seen congratulations to all sincerely your fan mrs r boone
4,i think i have made the right choice buying this cool one
4,this is an awesome piece and i got many complements while wearing it it is that rare combo of super comfortable yet amazing look all in one it does run a bit big especially on top but the stride is short so i had to keep my regular size or i would have had a wedgie all night
4,everything is good except fade display
4,i want to make this casserole for company has anyone tried making it and freezing it ahead of time
4,season is just great to me it is better than season and i really havent expected it to be cast is so good in acting that i cant put my finger on who is the best those two italian girls are so spontaneous in acting that it almost looks like they have been filmed by a hidden camera scenery of course is breathtaking my only slight complaint is on portia character actress although she is good in that role but her a bit chubby appearance somehow doesnt fit jennifer coolidge often laughs and cries forcedly so that her comicpathetic behavior is something on the border of irritant and circus like
4,i am always searching for effortless items this is a cute and classic shirt that meets all those requirements i actually really like the sleeves it take a basic tee and elevates the style i bought the teal but am also thinking about ordering the white too cant go wrong with a classic white tee
4,i made this as the recipe directed except i prepared my bacon on a sheet pan in the oven and then added it along with drippings to the skillet with onion and it was delicious the first batch went to the kids at church so my own family requested a batch for home simple to prepare hearty and satisfying
4,i originally purchased this in my usual retailer size vanity size lol and was nervous that the neck would be tight based on the other reviews however once i tried it on i realized that in my usual size the body was a little too wide and didnt create any shape i ended up exchanging for and keeping a size and it fits much better in the body and i did not have a problem with any tightness in the neck in either size for reference im dd lbs i would say this items runs true
4,this dress fits incredibly well i loved the color and it will transition through the fall nicely
4,this is the best series ive ever seen so naturalistic acting absolutely fine nick cave soundtrack the brutal but sensitive protagonist tommy shelby cillian murphy however the series is not only about business smuggling and violence it tells more than one love story shows family dramas and deep psychological problems that can crush even the most hardened viewer birmingham gang shows the true face of interwar birmingham revealing what life was really like back then it represents the dark dangerous side of the city the one where there are no laws only survival or death
4,a good midrange laptop from msi performance is best in this price range beats intel core i th gen
4,i watched it all in one sitting really enjoyed it reacher dude is like someone who has aspergers but is also a trained badass and investigator he also plays it exceptionally well there are a few technical faux pas like who makes us currency for one that made me laugh but otherwise it is solid highly recommend it to both men and women i think couples would enjoy watching it together after seeing this i can see why true reacher fans were so pissed at tom cruise being cast in the movie this dude is bigger than cruise from foot to knee
4,i have heard the dallas and breaking bad resemblance i just dont find any okey maybe storylines are bit mexican telenovels type of turns not very realistic anymore continuing the seasongs but dont matter but the family dynastics appeal to people like starks of winterfell really hate the female sister lead at moments selling romantic idea of farming in usa no steroids here most of the native american actors suck but i think u americans have these natives who would deserve an own drama series one day mountains and fields of course amazing loads of killing and shooting for men viewers point is to sell texas theme americans and educate about them and i think they succeed
4,the first few episodes are fun and will keep you thoroughly engaged with all the characters and the mysteries of nevermore however around episodes boredom strikes and you realise not much is happening on screen and the writers are trying to stretch the story to last netflixs quota for episodes so by the time episodes starts you end up losing all the goodwill you had for the show in the beginning credit where its due jenna ortega and emma myers were incredible and keeps you engaged even when the pace slackens and boredom creeps in this would have been an amazing series had it been shorter but the way it stands its just watchable
4,im glad i bought this dress with a discount its a comfortable staple but not a showstopper i love the plush fabric which has great weight and the skirt the top is cut to be a little revealing which worked well with my full bust but wouldnt be work appropriate the keyhole at the back is large but did not reveal my bra
4,value for moneybest suited for beginners and students in online classes
4,good laptop go for it
4,this top runs very large and is loose fitting in the middle it looks very flattering and is very comfortable i bought the one in red and it looks quite good i would go down one size maybe two
4,these culottes are adorable onif you order up two whole sizes they run extremely small fabric is thick high quality and a beautiful color
4,love this dress i wear a size large but had to return and order a medium planning to wear with boots its a light dress cute for work the only downside is that it wrinkles easily
4,i am very self conscience of my tummy and this covers it up without being too baggy there is plenty of room i originally bought a small then went to an extra small then went back to a small i wear a small in most things great nicer looking tee
4,nice change have made this twice amp will make it again
4,battery backup is low every thing is fine
4,nicely designed romper with an wide elastic waist band that can be worn on the hips or around the waist not too short for this body and very comfy i wear either a med or large and went with large for this a good buy
4,battery backup is g
4,this laptop value for money recommended to buy it
4,cute top good color fabric is a little rough and scratchy
4,i was a pc user so for similar specs it feels lower performance ofcourse and go for a better laptop it also has non extendable ramotherwise for very basic usage its very good due to its oled screen
4,super cute was really pleased with my purchase of this sweater runs just a little big
4,i read the other reviews that said the shirt ran small but i found that it fit fine and i chose my regular size in maeve the only issue is that its baggy around the middle which is a little off and i found that it was a little too short i gave it four stars because of the print i chose the cat print and its just so adorable i might try to have the shirt taken in at the waist and then it would be perfect
4,watching this with zero expectations turns out i enjoyed it much the fun thing for me is this series makes you guess whos bad person and whos not although it is giving riverdale vibe somehow it is understandable remembering the fact that this is a highschool mystery story so for me whose high school era has passed it is a lttle bit cliche but a fun cliche anyways whos on highschool somehow may relate to what the characters are going through the fact that jenna ortega has giving her all for this role also makes her character even more awesome as we know she learned celloand fencing herself the character i like here besides wednesday is enid and sometimes i feel bad for thing lol
4,i bought the ivory sweater lovely color and softness the zipper is a great unique feature that i love the bottom has a wavy shape with extra fabric definitely creates a bell shape
4,performance and design of the laptop is good the speaker is terrible for a laptop even a mobile phone speaker is louder and clearer compared to this
4,i bought the burgundy color in this shirt dress usually wear a size and xs in most brands purchased the xs in this dress im d the fabric is rayon however it feels more like a light flannel or soft brushed cotton like youve worn it forever the length says long but i found when worn with the belt it rides up substantially about inches above the knee felt like i was squirming to pull it down i normally wouldnt be drawn to something so simple but when i walked out
4,i love everything about this dress but the bust area the bottom is so light and flowey with the pleating makes you want to twirl the color is light but not as light as the photo it does not wash me out the problem is the bust it has pleats that billow out near the armpit area making you look top heavy the bottom is slimming the top make you look buxom the v neck is also higher than i would like which again adds to the fullness of the chest area i am still debating keeping this or re
4,i like this dress i did have to return one for a regular from a petite size normally i wear a size in retailer dresses but since i have a large bust dd i wanted to account for the needed room with the petite the bust was not so much a problem as the ribcage which was too tight it is still fitted in the regular size but doable the would have been impossible i am aware that i have a slightly larger ribcage so i was not completely surprised the other reason that i did not give th
4,i absolutely love the print on this fabric and the linen blend is perfect for warmer weather i do wish this top was more fitted overallit seems like the silhouette is a bit looser than is ideal however im keeping this and wearing it im lbs and ordered the petite
4,i really like tim burton really like the addams family so i definitely was looking forward to this show the start is great most of the characters are intriguing theres enough happening and the school feels very much alive after a couple episodes it changes the whodunnitplot leaves the school largely behind we get a story that doesnt leave much room for character development or to show of the quirky addams family traits and most characters are just a crux to further the plot the closer we get to the end the worse it gets the finale reminds me of buffy but in a bad way the creators of buffy were aware what they were portraying here the seriousness of everything just doesnt work and everything is kind of meh all around predictable baddies and a boring fight especially when there are so many different creatures to choose from so all in all its a mediocre show with jenna ortega being kind of the saving grace her acting is a joy to watch and when the scripts allows it she shines but alas its not enough to swing the pendulum
4,i purchased this to use in a samsung galaxy s phone it worked fine for about a month then the phone stopped recognizing it i was able to copy my photos before the computer stopped recognizing it as well sandisk replaced it under warranty and so far the new one has been fine
4,in the s the only way for women to be able to get pregnant was probably via intercourse the movie assumes this as well yet takes place after the advent of mobile phones and uber clearly the person who wrote this script is a male and is clueless about fertility most men today are still stupidmisinformed and think the best or only way for a women to get pregnant is by coitus the odds of women getting pregnant success rate via sexual intercourse decrease after the first menstrual cycles and the odds are like winning a lottery in comparison to ivf it can take couples up to a year to get pregnant not to go into detail but the spermatozoa has a long way to travel to fertilize the female ova for a women to pregnant via coitus the endometrium is shed through every menstrual cycle many men have damaged sperm low sperm count because they consume to much food with estrogen or dont wait long enough for sperm to form or due to age following ovulation the females egg is capable of fertilization for only to hours yes that is right hours in todays day and age doctors can insert the sperm directly through the cervix doctors can even insert a fertilized egg ivf is the process of fertilization by extracting eggs retrieving a sperm sample and then manually combining an egg and sperm in a laboratory dish most women who want to get pregnant go through ivf today an option unavailable to women when this book was written i dont know a single women who didnt get pregnant on a first try with ivf each had spent years trying to get pregnant the natural way in a totalitarian post uber and mobile phones world women would not be getting pregnant via sex like slaves this show would have made a lot more sense if it took place in the s technology has advanced far too much for this show to be remotely close to what a dystopian world would look like today everyone today knows that coitus has the lowest success rate for conceiving with age also people crossing over to canada to get away from the regime are you serious what about running to the indian reserves in every us state or the amish communities i read somewhere that the person who wrote the script for this movie visited iran and got information about islam from the un and based the script off of that if you want to make a show about muslim women than make the show about muslim women this show is absurd not a us dystopian reality in this day and age i give this movie because the acting is good
4,got this for during sale great value for money product good for casual gaming and editing p videos without any lags no lag while performing daily tasks handels basic stuff with ease cons speakers not loud enough non expandable ram
4,ive read all books played all games and i hoped the series would be good i have to say i love henry cavill in his role only triss i would change her cause of the hair i can understand that its not really easy to follow the story when you dont know the books but you will understand when you watch all episodes some changes to the books im skeptic but i hope they will end up finally good thanks for reading it my english is not the best
4,just made these using a couple of the other reviewers suggestions i used chocolate fudge pudding and whole wheat flour my husband loved them i felt they were a bit on the dry side though tasty the dryness could be the result of using whole wheat flouri will try the recipe again with all purpose flour to see if that was why they were so dry
4,laptop is goodreasonable cost and some drawbacks there like in the cooling fan space the fans doing so much noise than required to cool the laptop i have approched hp service as i got year warranty they solved but still sometimes it again making that huge noise at cooling fans it is not connecting the earphones at port i had tried more no of times if we want to attend any meetings or exams with wired earphones devices means we cant also we cant watch any movi read more
4,the first season still might be one of the best stories to come out on tv weaving time and perspective beautifully it was a fantasy story told like momento by christopher nolan with each episode revealing more mystery and reality for these unknown characters at the time the hype of the first carried season two for me but was confusing and our witcher didnt feel like the focus most of the time season three follows the same path but the dialogue somehow feels clunky and without direction the action stays great throughout if you can look past some hitormiss cgi the bar was just set too high after season one still worth a watch but keep your expectations at bay
4,fell in love with this the moment it arrived in stores whimsical but workappropriate im typically a in dresses i would say this skirt runs tts however the front pleats will create a pouchy stomach if you have a small waist and a lucious anythingbelowyourwaist size up one size to avoid this the waist size will be loose but it will allow the pleats to lay flat absolutely lovely with a mock neck sleeveless top also great with solid white black or printed blouses not a true pen
4,best laptop in this price
4,looks like a very healthy dish for what ails you
4,best in this segmentgo fot it for doing your regular tasks
4,love the design its screams retailer and is form fitting flattering and super cute however the material has the itch factor for me its not lined and therefore quite scratchy along the collar as well what a shame
4,very good my husband and toddler went back for seconds will try adding mushrooms to sauce next time
4,i tried this on in the store and loved it it is very comfortable i sized up one or two sizes i am very thin and somewhat petite but wanted a little more length it will be a great dress for fall as the fabric is heavy enough to wear into fall i think it looks better in person than online would recommend it if you like this kind of dress love that it has pockets too great quality
4,i really like this new show its much better than the recent movies that have been made the look and feel is star wars and i do like the special effects puppetry were possible and great costumes cgi only when needed just like in the old days while some people would disaggree i do like the slow pace at which the story unfolds only downside is that i have to wait another week for the next episode
4,i bought these in the store today theyre a great jean none of the pairs i saw had as much distressing as the picture there were no holes which im actually grateful for i dont like holes in jeans anyway these had a great fit for me they fit more like a slim straight jean on my curvier figure and really flatter my backside they arent baggy as pictured on the model theyre a great casual jean which i know will be my new staple even better my husband gave them a big thumbs up
4,super soft super comfy pants pain in the butt to iron out the wrinkles they came with
4,i would have skipped this after e the one with the extremely cheesy highschool dance the series has much promise but dabbles way too much in teeny soap jenna kept me watching shes got a ton of charisma in this role but then they take away all that by evolving her character from everything that makes her interesting to just another girl infatuated with the handsome artsy guy who then hands her an iphone for saving his life thats bad on so many levels this series could have set a counterpoint to mainstream instead the protagonist falls in line if theres a second season and it picks up where this one left us im out
4,best laptop but display is not nice and also flipkart service is garbage so go for same leptop at amazonnn
4,product is overall good oled display nice to watchnice performance and smooth but very worst deliveryekart logisticsi had been wait for around days to get my product
4,this is nice product for yor study and specially coding
4,good for students
4,my hubby hates chinese food which he considers dishes like this but he really loved the flavor the chicken had and we ate up all the leftovers
4,this dress is a nice twist on a luncheonwork dress can pair with blazer or sweater and it looks really cute with hair styled up almost throwback zipper sometimes gets a little caught on the lace top but overall im really happy with this dress
4,an entertaining show the whole family can enjoy we love the plotdrama and comedy of it all of course grogubaby yoda is our favorite really coolthe use of puppets isnstaed of cg thank you jon favreaualways loved you
4,was skeptical proven wrong i would devour seasons of this instantlyif i could
4,i absolutely love this show i am so glad that i was bored and stumbled across peaky blinders on netflix i instantly became addicted to it i highly recommend this show the peaky blinders has everything action humor sex drugs booze and so much more i have a new found respect and admiration for cillian murphy who leads the show as thomas shelby the success driven gangster leader of the peaky blinders gang i binge watched this show and am so happy i did do yourself a favor and take the time to watch this show you will not regret doing so peaky blinders keeps me on my toes i never know what the shelby family are prepping to do next this show is an absolute home run
4,beautiful color and soft material but runs a little big so size down i loved that it was complementing to my figure without making me look larger
4,exciting gripping every single episode gets you on the edge of your seat loved it
4,the banana bread was good three of us finished the two loaves in days i will try the recipe on this site that uses pineapple and compare
4,this is a gorgeous sweater but huge and when i say huge i mean gigantic im usually a size large and i dont even think the small would be small enough the cowl neck and fabric overall is great although stretches out which is why it becomes so overwhelming but the sweater just hung on me like a short blanket the armholes are very big deceiving on the model returning
4,very good probably the best crisp we have had it was even better when i added chopped almonds to the top layer of the crumbly stuff next time ill use more cups of apples and cup white sugar in the syrup instead of cup it was on the cusp of being too sweet we didnt have ice or whipped cream so this rating is just the crisp
4,very good product a little big i like the adjustable side of each function damage there is missing a remote control
4,this fits tts it is bodyhugging as shown on the model the knit is thin soft with tons of stretch i bought the navy which is the color shown in the photo as you can see its not really navy its a strange blue thats more like a faded dark mallard blue but its still blue the sleeves are long on me so you taller girls wont have issues the ruffles move and are so fun the fabric however is not finished off its raw cut material which is why i gave it stars
4,i agree with other reviewers that this top runs large im glad i ordered a size down its a cute twist on a basic tee shirt
4,good customer support if facing any issue can be easily connected to the customer battery normally otherwise good
4,i like this recipe a lotits so easy to makeand makes enough tasty leftovers for a few more meals
4,fantastic work its all about the woman violence
4,the original hbomax series white lotus is fantastic i highly recommend you watch all the seasons season one from hawaii season two from italy and season three which is now currently airing which takes place in thailand this review will pertain to season three which so far three episodes have aired and it has been fantastic this is must see tv the first few episodes averaged about million viewers which is unheard of for cable tv streaming the cinematography the locales the casting the dialogue is all fantastic i highly recommend you get hbomax and begin to watch these shows these shows are better than of the movies that are playing out in the theater or on other streaming services this season of white lotus which takes place in thailand centers around three main storylines the wealthy ratliff family from north carolina featuring a husband a wife and three kids a trio of three caucasian girlfriends who grew up together but are now living separate but are reuniting for a girls trip and the mysterious rick and his girlfriend chelsea who are vacationing at the white lotus there are some very entertaining and great acting performances here from the above mentioned storylines other major plot lines include belinda the spa manager from white lotus season one who is now doing some type of a training seminar at the white lotus in thailand and also the enigmatic greggary who was in seasons one and two and now appears in season three in thailand there is also a plot regarding two of the intriguing local employees that work at the white lotus in thailand including real life pop star lisa and actor tayme thapthimthong i am not going to give away specifics on the show i want everyone to enjoy this fantastic miniseries there are only eight episodes here for white lotus in thailand each episode is approximately one hour long so the season will go by quickly we are now entering into episode number four i hope you all enjoy white lotus as i said before i would start with season one then season two then begin watching season three take care and enjoy brad p in cleveland
4,season was alright but season after a great start took a nose dive characters didnt stay true to their own identity story didnt follow any natural flow whilst it was slapped together which felt fake i have read the booksgames while my partner didnt know anything about the witcher story beside the netflix show for both of us season it was really boring and non inspiring hope they will bring it back for season or it will be lost in the netflix mediocrity
4,best value for money
4,good laptop with decent price only battery gets low fast all okay
4,i skipped the skillet part and just baked the whole thing in the oven really good we all liked it
4,steven knights writing pulls you in straight away the main character tommy shelby is intriguing from the outset with very strong characters surrounding him outstanding performances all cast members too many to mention a period of time in birmingham that i never knew about great watch
4,i bought this sweater because i love twinkles knitting patterns and yarns this sweater doesnt disappoint i love all of the great details like the detachable collar the double buttons along the front and the back panel is in a seed stitch which differs from the front and sleeve stitch its super warm and cozy but its also very heavy depending on the temp outside i can wear this as a coat but i think the sweater will stretch over time because its so heavy
4,no matter what mac salad recipe i make my husband always rates it ok this salade he liked and even had seconds it seemed kind of blah so i added l cup of sweet pickles we thought it added alot
4,alan ritchson is a perfect jack reachera hunk of a man with a brooding almost anti social attitude who seeks justice and makes hes own rules the series did a great job in helping us know the man by youth flashbacks and snippets of character scenes like the one with the abused dog he is a man you would definitely want in your corner his charisma overtakes the screen but his rage is always there but he uses it to help the defeated ritchson is an actor i did not know but he is powerful and so macho handsome and the rest of the cast so a terrific job especially willa fitzgerald as roscoe i absolutely love this series
4,this a great card with lots of storage for the money dont hesitate in buying this its a steal for the amount of storage you get
4,great actors acting and story i am from sweden so modern western is hard to find but this is outstanding i want more now
4,murray bartlett was such an incredible surprise for me i havent seen much of his work but he was wonderful to watch he was definitely my favorite character as for the rest of the show it honestly relates to anyone whos worked in the service industry had toxic relationships hellish family vacations or even vacationed alone mike white managed to capture an incredible amount of depth within a wide range of characters in just six episodes and everything paid off the cinematography the music the lighting again the performances well worth the watch
4,gjb quality
4,my pie didnt set upfollowed instructions to a teebut we ate it with a spoongreat flavor
4,i had the card about months in my galaxy s and then it suddenly went into a read only mode all the data was still there and i was able to copy it all from the card but could not write or format the card i searched the internet high and low for a solution and then finally contacted sandisk support after explaining my problem they said it will need to be replaced and it would be covered under warranty the replacement process took about two weeks they paid for return shipping i now have the nd card and have had it running for about weeks nowwell see if i just happened to get a bad one or if they all are of questionable quality
4,everything about this jumper is lovely the color the fit the fabric corduroy anything rules but the first day i wore it the zipper was a problem it was missing a tooth my husband helped me work around that to zip it up for a sunday drive i unzipped to nurse our baby and then we couldnt get it back up and it just separated leaving me half dressed in the restaurant was going to have it repaired but will send back now that i see they have more i dont know about yall but i always feel a
4,i bought this shirt in a size small it fits the same as it does on the model its a comfortable cute shirt wish the other colors were available because id order another one
4,i bought this in both the taupe and ivory the beading on the neck line the tie at the neck and the pleats make this a fun shirt i bought a size which is normally what i wear at retailer so i would say it is true to size i really like the length of the top it hits midhip on me it is a tad shorter on the sides than i would like but it is still long enough to cover my waistline i also think the arms are too long so there is kind of a balloon look at my wrists because of it i bought it to
4,i made this for my family they did enjoy it i however altered the recipe by adding garlic salt and garlic powder to taste the sauce seemed to taste just like tomatoes to me so it needed tweaking i also dont buy beef broth i made my own with beef base and water maybe that was the difference anyway already had one request for this again we love mexican inspired dishes
4,good once it offering much spec in this segment bt it has chief plastic body looking ok ok
4,i bought this sweater to wear with leggings for fall and winter the quality is nice but the color is a bit different than the pic it has more brown than true berry in it it is very soft and stretchy but is a bit boxy on i am debating whether to keep it or not it was a little cheaper with my birthday discount applied but not sure id keep it if it was full price
4,i made this tonight i did change it up a little bit though i omitted the carrots and the roux used to thicken the soup when a soup has lots of cheese like this one does a roux to thicken things isnt really necessary in my opinion i added a little bit of dill weed as well which gave it a little kick my boyfriend had picked out a hickory smoked bourbon gouda that he decided he wasnt a fan of after i already sliced some for his lunch so i threw that in there too were definitely going to be making it again
4,this cute dress is swingy and chock full of fun little details love the embroidery colors crochet lace tassels wide sleeves dont like that its all polyester and some embroidery is unraveling so i dont know what to do about that size down if your petite or slender im a medlarge c and medium fit great at the bodiceshoulders hem hits my knees in regular size
4,i loved this dress as soon as i tried it on but it bunched up weird in the front around my hips i ordered a second size hoping that it would fit better but same thing if i tried to go to a size it would be too big every where else fyi im lbs and im a runner its not like i have a huge backside or anything my guess is sizing is off ive tried another of his dresses and it fit perfectly
4,good price and fast enough to load mp files from the computer quickly i use these in sansa clip mp players perfect match
4,i noted that this runs large i should say it runs wide it is supposed to be flowy like in the picture but i am really swimming in the l that being said i worry that if i returned for a m that it would be too short in the front i am for reference and i would say the length in front is a little shorter than i would like but it still works the black and white print is beautiful i paired it today with dark skinny jeans and received compliments other reviews about the batwing sleeves
4,read the reviews and was a little nervous to make this i added the tsp of salt and i changed the vanilla to tablespoons it turned out very good its a good base cake plenty of options came to mind after i tasted it
4,still needs more flavor this will probably be better tomorrow it takes a very long time to make though so im not sure if ill make this again i think its a great base recipe for sure i wanted to rate this as is and not make any changes
4,yeah i know that sounds ridiculous but this is really a nice piece the fabric is thin and soft with a little structure to avoid any pajama vibes the color is perfect a middeep indigo with just enough fading i dont find it unwieldy or challenging to get on and off and i like how the fit is adjustable with the waist tie that said it does run small im usually a and started off with a m it was pretty form fitting and the ct risk was at orange level then the zipper wouldnt stay u
4,ill be wearing this to holiday parties this year pretty fashionable not fussy
4,i had been hearing a bit of hype around this dress it had seemed that most were either loving or hating it which can be true for a lot of swing dresses as some give off that baby bump vibe i saw a friend try one on in petite and we both agreed it ran a little short even for us at just over feet tall when i finally made it into a store i noticed that they had quite a few in regular sizing in stock i grabbed a xs regular to try on and i loved it with heels it falls perfectly and
4,i a looking forward to wearing this dress with a jean or leather jacket the dress is well made and the fringe adds a nice detail to the otherwise basic design be sure to order a couple of sizes smaller than your regular size because the dress is huge i ordered the dress in both colors and am keeping the blue
4,ive gone from a in season to a in season to a season very little makes sense in the latest series and if not for henry cavill id give it a the show makes so many wrong terms and unnecessary situations that are unneeded or make the show unenjoyable weve taken the witcher in the wrong direction i need more monsters and battles that make sense to me they need to focus more upon the main three especially geralt and not so much the supporting cast the show now lacks character and direction and there seems to be a lack of gallantry for some of the characters they have forgotten what their goal is
4,serena fred and aunt lydia amazing characters as for june if it wasnt for my curiosity i wouldnt have watched it i could hardly stand her too many face close ups and her face expressions in the beginning i felt sorry for her but then i started to dislike her what an unfortunate choice of female main role interesting plot very slow in most parts i watched it in fast forward after first season hope it wont put ideas to anyones head up there lol
4,this dress was overall cute but you have to have an olivedarker complexion or a nice tan to really pull it off because it is such a pale pink im very fare but normally can do light punks but this one just clashed it does run pretty true to size if youre on the edge between a smaller or bigger size i recommend the smaller size however hope this helps yall
4,while randomly picking up my upcoming show to watch on netflix its oversimplified title did not really give me any promising expectation but thing went straight for me to realize it was definitely what i should have spent my day on when the background was briefly mentioned triggering my brain to acknowledge that it had the jokes i have ever wanted the dark humors were fascinating though they were what i could imagine however it was such a good time to have seen a show with numerous of it and not being awkward but cheerful hope it can get its second season and things can continue with their unique vibes
4,this is cute ive been so looking forward to it but its big im usually a small in retailer size medium most of the time otherwise i ordered the medium but its way too big doesnt fit at all like the pictures sadly its going back hopefully for a much smaller size but other than this its lovely
4,performs as it is supposed to gb is quite a lot of storage plus my samsung galaxy has gb of internal memory for a total of gb thats plenty enough to store hundreds of hours of music
4,peak perfomence
4,good product in this price point
4,i was shopping for a holiday outfit today at my retailer store and my sales associate suggested i try on this top i have lo idea where it was on the store l yet its a very pretty top that stands out when you have it on i took this in a small because its meant to run shorter i felt xs would have been too small i purchased it to wear with jeans or dress pants pretty detail blouse shows off my arms and minimizes my waist i love it
4,great card for a great price read and write speeds are on par with what is posted on the specifications detail report
4,in a world where video game adaptations have often struggled to find their footing on the small screen the last of us stands out as a shining example of how to do it right the series based on the beloved video game has managed to retain the most addictive elements of its source material while weaving a deeper and emotionally charged narrative that stands on its own one of the most impressive aspects of the last of us is its ability to strike a balance between homage and originality while some scenes lifted directly from the game may have led to pacing issues for some viewers the shows departure from the games narrative has been a breath of fresh air enriching the story and drawing in both fans and newcomers alike the production design deserves applause as it masterfully recreates the games environments making viewers feel like theyve stepped right into the postapocalyptic world the use of lighting and cinematography adds an extra layer of depth drawing out the humanity of the characters and creatures in a way that sets it apart from other adaptations pedro pascal and bella ramseys performances as joel and ellie are nothing short of exceptional their chemistry on screen is magnetic making them irresistibly watchable as they navigate the challenges and dangers of their journey pascals portrayal of joel has been described as a true embodiment of the character while ramseys portrayal of ellie has been hailed as a breakout performance striking a perfect balance between comedy and emotion the guest performances in the last of us are a true highlight with a talented cast delivering remarkable portrayals that add richness to the narrative each character feels authentic and wellcrafted contributing to the shows overall success while the show offers thrilling action sequences it is during its quieter moments that the last of us truly shines these moments allow the characters to breathe bringing out the complexities of their personalities and forging powerful emotional connections with the audience the last of us isnt just a show its an experience with its captivating storytelling outstanding performances and stunning production design it stands as a compelling example of how to adapt a video game into a bingeworthy tv series whether youre a fan of the game or a newcomer to this world the last of us is an absolute mustwatch
4,well first off i knew a jumpsuit was going to be a gamble for me i have a long torso at feet but i just loved the print and the style and typically all things sactuary so i was willing to risk it sadly the torso length was an issue and it seemed to run small to mei ordered a small which usually would fit fine but ended up pulling across my hips and with the patten being what it is well on me it just wasnt flattering or comfortable
4,i was very excited to receive this dress i ordered my normal size small which i should have realized was a mistake you could fit two of me in that size small i realize the dress is supposed to be flowy but it would have been baggy on me at nine months pregnant the fabric is soft and comfy and the pattern is cute but order at least one size down im going to exchange for the xs in hopes of it not resembling a short muumuu
4,im lbs and i bought these in a they fit great i wore them for upwards of hours and i was very comfortable i received compliments on the print and cut very flattering
4,i am a recent convert to this show i have now binged watched all seasons astounding cillian murphy steals the show saying that the cast is superb and the amount of emotions elicited are fantastic keep up the good work
4,i ordered the xs p and xxs p in the black one i thought this would be a fairly classic piece to wear any season cold offices in the summer southern california in the winter the xxs p was a bit better fitted not too small but the xs p was ok too if you prefer a baggier look so based on that i call it large as i would usually purchase the xs p not xxsp lbs dd in waist muscular arms the material is airy and light but i am a little worried about wrinkling we shall see
4,i used cans of black beans and omitted the refried beans i exchanged corn tortillas for flour and increased the cheese to cups instead of a oz can of tomatoes try using two cans oz each of rotel tomatoes
4,loved the writing the camera work and all bar one actor annabelle wallis cant act
4,i loved this sweater as soon as i opened the package it was soft and the colors of grey peach and white were perfect for this to were into the spring time i am lbs and purchased the xs the arm length was perfect the sweater length hit slightly above my hips the style of the sweater is a bit boxy but not so much that it looks like your wearing a tent
4,this sheath is extremely wellmade and the fabric is even more vibrant and beautiful than it looks in the photos my only complaint it does run a little small in the bodice my usual size fit like a dream everywhere but the top which borders on uncomfortably snug for reference im a full b
4,i am usually a mediumlarge and was pleased to fit in the smallmedium that i ordered after reading some of the reviews lovely piece great to wear over a short sleeve tshirt of a sleeve shirt or even a long sleeve shirt when weather permits here in florida very happy i ordered this
4,i just got this suit in and i was pretty excited about it however it does not have lined cups like it says no boob support whatsoever though i think the pattern distracts enough that im keeping it anyways dd i do think it might be too short for a taller person im only and it just barely comes up high enough to cover me and i dont think big boobs are the reason also it is pretty cheeky which it does mention maybe a little expensive but i did use a coupon
4,a very cute and comfy top thats lightweight and falls nicely but it does snag very easily so far ive worn this top once and found small snags in multiple areas the snags might blend into the fabric texture if they did not create dark spots the yarnthread is a mixture of a celadon tone and black which concentrates the black when snagged
4,i bought this for my gopro hd hero camera as it was the one recommended by most buyers ive had zero problems with the card and the included adaptor makes it easy to transfer my videos to my pc these things are tiny though and thin so be careful not to bend or lose them the price is reasonable as well
4,the handmaids tale starts of very strong with a very interesting dystopian future it is told very slow but that helps with the dark and depressing atmosphere this show has some great acting perfomances and shocking moments captured on screen something that is very interesting is that the horrible footage you get to see loses its shockvalue because you get used to it but also because after some time you get bored by nothing moving forward or being reversed after change then the slowness starts to get annoying unfortunately in the second season many of the characters started to make less sense for me which threw me a of this continues in the third season but the worst thing is that gilead and the punishments seem to be inconsequent and more like the plot needs them to be it seems like the longer the story continues june can do more or less whatever she wants without punishments as hard as other sidecharacters would get i stopped watching during the third season because i thought about the logic as a whole and noticed that quite many things already during the first season dont add up or are inconsistent so in conclusion against the mainstream the handmaids tale gets weaker not stronger each season and if you dont get soaked in by the atmosphere but question the plot and the world in its logic it starts to make way less sense i really thought this would become one of my favourite shows
4,turned out well
4,bear with me for a second i live in london and honestly i find it very off putting and unrealistic the everyone speaks with very strong and distinct british accent it just feels like im watching my neighbours and locals acting in the movie if you were from lets say australia wouldnt you mind if all actors spoke with australian accent in this movie or more spoken english is with british accent a lot of new productions do this nowadays and i just cant bear it its both lazy and unrealistic what happened with training to learn a new accent as other actors such as anthony hopkins or christian bale have done in the past
4,cashmere is soft as a feather yet warm easy to wear and the pointelle stitches are lovely i feel lovely wearing this and im really not that kind of lady so if you imagine a side of yourself wanting to try out feeling lovely bite the bullet and buy this cardigan it does run small in my bust area but all the rest fits well
4,this is a great shirt its super comfortable and fits nicely not too big and not too small you can wear it with leggings or dress it up with skinny jeans and boots i bought the striped and black one i highly recommend it
4,after setting a pack of piranhas loose in a swimming pool where her brothers bullies were training wednesday addams jenna ortega is expelled from school she subsequently gets shipped off to nevermore academy a school for gifted outcasts where her parents gomez and morticia met and fall in love although she has no intention of fitting in her new school she nevertheless finds friends even a couple of romantic interests while on a quest to hunt for a serial killer in their community a crisp dialogue dripping with sarcasm and dark humor as well as a gripping mystery keeps this drama highly engaging jenna ortegas version of wednesday addams is fascinating i also enjoyed catherinezeta jones morticia it was a treat to see flashbacks of gomez and morticia as students in the academy i actually hope their young characters would have a fulllength drama
4,i had just bleached my hair really blonde and was in the mood for something pink so when i saw the rose color of this sweater in the store it fit the bill nice and easy to wear a wee bit scratchy but not too bad
4,i cut the recipe in half but forgot to cut the spices in half because of that this had a lot of bite also used white kidney beans as we cant get great northern beans where i live next time when i make it properly i think i will still cut back on the cumin and cayenne pepper
4,very good purchase at this price
4,just need alittle apple pie spice and its great
4,what a great show i love all the dysfunctional stuff but you can still empathise with some of the characters funny and moving hope theres another series but cant see it without armond
4,i really like this product i use it in my double cleansing routine after using oil to remove my makeup this product helps removing all the rest i feel that it really respect my acne prone skin and leaves it fresh and smooth this review was collected as part of a promotion
4,good spec considering its price
4,i loved this dress when i saw it mostly for its emerald color i am tan with brown hair and features so green is a good color for me the quality is very high with detailed embroidery and thick fabric the dress comes with a slip which fits well but i dont think youd have to wear based on the opaqueness of the fabric the dress fits true to size but the cut is gracious through the hips this is a relaxed fitting drop waist dress
4,i tried this on in a m it fit tts aside from the fact that there were super long very form fitted and flattering
4,while i love this top beautiful color and pattern i found it to be a bit short if it were a few inches longer i would be thrilled im curvy and have a long torso so that may be the problem i will say that within hours of wearing this i had strangers stop me and comment re how pretty it is i am keeping it
4,i bought the laptop for android studio with emulator and its working great i am disappointed with the display but it make sense for the price for me performance is good so i hope i get used to the display
4,this top is beautiful the lace is sturdy and intricate and the top drapes perfectly slimming but a word to the wise the lace does not stretch at all even though the rest of the material does and that coupled with where it is on the bust and back means very limited movement unless you are a size with an narrow backchest and shoulders i cant imagine anyone with a cup size larger than a b wearing this i am lbs and a b and always a small or medium and a size for reference i
4,overall good for daily tasks it is not for gaming it gives battery back up for hours while browsing doing ms office works video playing the built quality is top notch
4,i took the suggestion of one of the readers and used a toffee bar instead of the nuts wonderful flavor but even though the pan was sprayed the candy sunk to the bottom of it amp i mean it stuck most of it had to be soaked off next time i will do it without the toffee bar
4,best value of money and best design
4,ports placement could be better
4,i tried on the xs in the store and i dont need a petite in this but perhaps a xxs it is on the shorter side so no great on my muscular thighs if petite whereas the regular size hit me just above the knee the cut is away from the body a bit aline but not fitted the colors are gorgeous but i think this is more of a casual dress like brunch with the girlfriends for example love it it is now in my wish list for alter
4,works fine as sandisk usually does i know theres a lot of discussion about transfer rates and so forth but im fine if the rate isnt so fast or slow i really dont care long as it holds and keeps the data until i can transfer it all these cards seem to me to be about the same sandisk is the big name and so i usually stick with it but i have other makes that are just as good
4,i purchased this online because i just loved the gorgeous designs and embroidery it has a unique cut to it as it has wrist holes but is otherwise open i have a difficult time keeping it from falling off of my shoulders when i wear it over bear skin i hope it will stay in place when i wear it over long sleeves or a sweater overall i am happy with it but i think it may run small as it hits the model at her wrists but hits me above my elbow i am not very tall or longlimned so it seems strang
4,this show makes you divided between the cowboy and the indian you see how both have earned their seat at the table cant wait to see whats next
4,display design performance cannot game value for money only limitation is limited port availablity otherwise its the best laptop you can get under k though shopsy dont think too much go ahead absolute beauty
4,its not an exaggeration to say this is literally riverdale and chilling adventures of sabrina story lines that got rearranged copy and pasted for this shows plot i know that because i did myself the misfortune of sitting through all these shows its a disappointment with misleading trailers and reviews its so grossly overhyped just for you to realize its nothing but a lazy cashgrab and thats why every promotion focused so much attention to the big names rather than the story or content itself something that you can unmask about the positive reviews is that none of them are critical or capable of a detailed opinionated review their reviews are vague and reasonless because they liked the decent looking actors the superficial aesthetic the good but basic indieoverplayed soundtrack and the slightly tim burton atmosphere but theyre unable to pinpoint that because most of these reviewers are likely unaware of it when it comes to the actual story no way did anyone like this shallow plot that is no joke a ripoff of riverdale and chilling adventures of sabrina the protagonist is a cookie cutter weird girl who always has to remind you every time she opens her mouth that shes not like other girls which gets old quick but lasts the whole series no character not even the protagonist has growth depth character or culture which is ironic because of how much jenna talks in interviews about representing her latin culture the dialogue the writers wrote for the protagonist is very clearly what a mindless person would imagine a thinking person sounds like but to anyone sensible she just sounds very pretentious and childishly edgy while previous depictions of wednesday made her a smart and funny character and movies like addams family values gave her growth this wednesday is hard to not cringe at you can tell this was just a paycheck to the creators because they literally thought throughout this series that a oneoff act done in the movies was some kind of deeper connection to her history they took an interesting eccentric family and instead chose to center the story on boring cardboard cutouts of fantasy teen drama extras who are an unsubtle attempt to oneup the eccentrics of the family which obviously misses the entire point of the addams family on the second watch it really stuck out how bad the acting is most of the actors are either underperforming their parts or dramatically performing like disney channel cartoon characters in its most basic proposition this show had potential if there were any creative minds involved the biggest disappointment is the reception lousy cliche cash grabs like this getting positive support to this extent just confirms people will eat up anything if they like the aesthetic the big names and the heavily reused soundtrack regardless of any effort or creativity on their end people will pay a lot more for copy and pasted formulaic media were in a neverending cycle of unoriginal and uninspired remakes reboots redesigns spinoffs sequels etc because big companies like getting rid of any shred of originality and people support milking out any creativity to the point media becomes this dry its frustrating because even the people involved in making this series have publicly admitted to rushing it and inserting the most basic and predictable cliches because of how little this sideproject mattered to them
4,my family loved this i will make this again
4,absolutely awful episodes and showed improvement but then episode torpedoed any sliver of hope the writing for this episode is pathetic im sticking to my initial critique there is zero charisma and depth in these characters and the story this season is sophomoric at best its like a bad s spring break film only set in thailand instead of daytona beach i wish i could get back the five hours ive wasted on this season not one of the story lines is compelling its basically an r rated infomercial what happened to the writer the magic is just gone the show is a victim of its own success
4,overall multiworking laptop but i face some issue in speaker it is little bit low overall ill give but display is best in this price range
4,i was excited to see these on sale in the honey color i wanted unfortunately they were really more of a yellow than the golden color in the photo also they were so baggy in the rear that i looked silly which was surprising since i dont have a small behind unfortunately all the smaller sizes were sold out had to send them back
4,this is a class microsd card and it works just as advertised its very fast good for recording hd video and such its pretty decently priced per gig for a card of its classhowever beware that adapter that comes with it put the card in good luck getting it back out i made the mistake of doing this to test the memory on my laptop and actually had to resort to pliers to pull them out which is probably not a great way to keep the chip in tiptop shape note i also said them there i got two of these and they were both that way so i doubt it was just a manufacturing defectbuy the memory throw away the adapters seriously they are dangerous to use and for all intents and purposes convert it into a standard sd card permanentlyproreliablefastgood priceconadapter its a trap
4,but its a solid the actress who plays wednesday jenna ortega is very good as is christina ricci and gwendoline christie where it falls flat is the casting of catherine zeta jones as morticia who isnt terrible but not that good either and luiz guzman as gomez whoever thought that these two would be a good fit should be shot because between them they have zero chemistry and its painful to watch when i used to watch the old black and white adams family and the later remakes with angelica houston and raul julia there was real sexual chemistry between the them and thats was what made its so good but this lack that chemistry and even though theyre only in a couple of episodes they felt awkward to watch but having said all that its still a solid show and worth watching if you liked sabrina on netflix youll like this its very similar in that it takes away some of the humour and replaces it with horror
4,love this cake i used raspberries and blackberries instead of strawberries it was great
4,i feel that this could be the beginning of a top series on par with or even surpassing the walking dead for example but hold onwhile i see many euphoric reviews i believe the show has not yet reached a level of excellence the first season starts off slow but becomes more engaging as we delve deeper into this new postapocalyptic world i think pedro pascals performance and role are excellent and are a major reason for the shows success however i dont feel the same about ellie she doesnt seem to fully capture the charisma or fit the character well i should mention that i know about the video game but have never played it and i enjoy the series just the same however this means i cant comment on how well it was adapted
4,this may be one of my favorite purchases from retailer in a long time i really appreciate the unique design a quality that has drawn me to retailer for years the cute little quirky owls are as rich in color as they are in personality im dont typically favor cheaper polyester blends though the texture feels fine on my skin this top definitely runs small and i had to size up to get the fit and length i desired overall i am very pleased and have received lots of compliments after wearin
4,these pants are made of a beautiful fabric that really brings out the rich color like others have said they fit almost like highwaisted leggings which i for one love it makes them really comfortable while the nice heavy fabric and lovely tailoring make it appropriate for an office i do find that the pockets are pretty useless as having anything in them ruins the lines of the trousers the zipper is a bit pokey as well
4,i bought this dress for an upcoming bridal shower i am attending it fits great is flattering and i can also wear it to work since it is long enough overall it was a great purchase
4,there was a few tv shows that i can say they are at this rank this was a masterpiece beautiful actingperfect storyincredible ending must watch
4,the last of us is my favorite video game and i was really excited for the live action to start i was afraid it wouldnt live up to my expectations but i must say that i loved the first episode there were many scenes that looked exactly like the video game for example when joel sarah and tommy are in the car in the beginning the way we see from sarahs perspective and how the camera rotates inside the car to film sarah i felt like i as playing all over again so far its fateful to the video game i think the cast is well chosen as i see and hear them i remember them as the video game characters immediately and got flashbacks from the game the script is well written even the music is in it
4,we really enjoyed the flavor of this dish it was a little more like soup than chili but that did not bother us i will definitely make this again super fast and tasty meal
4,good laptop will great specsall the daily tasks are well executed
4,these are extremely soft but do run about one size too big with one exception the opening to pull your feet through that bag nicely around your ankles is soooooo small that you have to work to pull the heel of your foot out for me these are dual duty pants casual wear like to the grocery store or coffee shop trip and second as great soft pj bottoms though the ankles are small they do not feel tight at all because the fabric is really that soft they work well with both my sneakers and clas
4,hi im reviewing this laptop after days and findings are pros ms offfice student and window home processor is good as it can run the video editing software filmora smoothly design asthestic is good but its not feel sturdy enough touchpad is wide and works smoothly screen display is good data transfer speed is good its ram and hard disk is expandable which is good but i didnt use its feature cons battery charger is not good and battery heating issues are there read more
4,super
4,that old school star wars energy is certainly alive and well in the series ecosystem what i found unique here was seeing the story of the empires rise through the eyes of the proverbial man in the street and how an oppressive and totalitarian regime can insert itself into society at a slow enough pace that most people will just integrate it into their new normal its refreshing to see and feel the impact of this beyond it just being a story of the jedi and politicians but as a story of real and relatable people who dont have resources like jedi masters the force and fleets of starships at their disposal yet and how all that it takes is for someone to go first i didnt think id see a series in the star wars universe that makes even the mandalorian look a bit clunky but here we are with a gritty cyberpunk gimmickfree and honest story that eclipses pretty much all other recent efforts
4,good recipe i did go with the extra pumpkin and left out the water iffy about the raisins but went with them tasty addition
4,best laptop at this price
4,this is why i shop at retailer i was in one of my local stores recently mainly to check out the sale my boyfriend was with me we hadnt been in the store minutes when we passed a table with piles of folded tees this one caught my eye the color omg and then flowers and butterflies try it on he said as i held one up no i shouldnt we wandered around checked out the sale and all the new and i was back at that table looking at that tee so i took a small and an xs to the fitting
4,a good product
4,love the top it fits wonderfully and its lightweight my only complaint is that it has little loops that are prone to getting caught on things other than that its a great spring top
4,this top has a beautiful pattern and the color is gorgeous just like the photo it is very thin but under a sweater or blazer in the fallwinter would be perfect it is a little big i would order a size down
4,i havent played the game though i was aware of it i was still really looking forward to this screen adaption anything with zombies in it and im excited i wanted to wait till at least after watching the second episode before leaving a review reason being that i didnt want it to be a case of the first episode being a fluke the first episode was brilliant it had me right on the edge of my seat and engrossed from the moment it started i was invested in the characters and there was no fault to be placed anywhere by the end of the first episode i was definitely left wanting more i was especially excited to see that anna torv from mind hunter was in it playing tess the second episode also did not disappoint the dynamic between ellie ramsey and joel pascal is captivating i am learning also not to get too attached to anyone along the process i am definitely in the for the long haul and keen to see how the storyline develops and watch the relationship between ellie and joel develop more into a father and daughter type role this show is definitely worth a watch i hope that they know when to end it though and dont keep it churning for season after season like the walking dead
4,this is a lovely piece with great shape and details i think it would really stand out at events i ended up returning it i dont have much occasion for cocktail dresses i had trouble sending it back it has a slip with the sheer overlay the slip seemed a bit tight at the bottom hem for the shape of the dress
4,played blackmyth wukong and it ran it fps in very high settings and laptop is an allrounder but fan is bit loud when playing in performance mode but silent and balance mode is good for regular task
4,this dress is absolutely perfectly delightful fits like a glove and is stunning on i couldnt be happier with this purchase i wore it to a wedding in october and felt beautiful and sexy all at the same time i usually struggle with dresses because i am under feet i purchased a p and it fits very well no tailoring needed only problem was that once i was on the dance floor the hooks in the front of the dress began to come undone yikes i had to leave the dance floor a couple of times and
4,my mother made these using a can of tomato soup for the sauce ive made it with green pepper plus onion and an egg
4,the product is good but the battery drains fast too the base clock speed is ghz only overall style performance all great value for money
4,they were good i like cloves but dont love them if i did these might get stars
4,i made this soup for dinner last night based on reviews that stated their husbands do not care for soup but loved this one my husband does not care for soup but i love all soups i thought this soup was really good and would definately eat it again my husband said it was ok and would eat it again as a filler the only change i made was to use pound of hamburger i cant imagine that pound would be enough
4,this sweater is exactly what you think it is comfy it doesnt have much shape its pretty boxy but thats the point its not one of those figure flattering kind but its also not shabby looking its so darn comfortable and soft and the colors are so upbeat and beautiful since its a fuzzy yarn type of fabric i think the fuzz might start to fall out eventually and i have to be careful not to snag anything on it because i dont want to pull the knitting loose other t
4,i think i would try chicken next time i would have liked a bit stronger pumpkin flavor as well i tossed in a dash of cinammon which added a nice flavor
4,the retailer by me actually had this and i had to try it on my thoughts below ___________ pros wellconstructed with lining underneath to avoid the need of a cami or tank no seethrough issues whatsoever the fabric is great quality and looks nicely sewn no fraying or strays seen on the sizes i tried theres a back zipper that goes from top to bottom at the back unusual as i dont see why thats needed since you can just slip it over your head front v slit isnt too low or reve
4,it has heating problem while charging remaining product and performance is great
4,i generally like this style of pants and these are particularly interesting flattering and perfect for the season love them the style can be bohemian and chic or more conservative the color is also a dark navy and there is black leather piping on the pockets making them a neutral navy or black ive worn with a long sleeveless hilow hemmed button down top and neutral saddle heels for work with a cream jacket and with a tshirt and flats for the weekend they have a bit of str
4,batter is excellent performance is great core i and gb ram combination is good must buy
4,loved the frosting cupcakes were a little dry and i only baked them min would try next time
4,this show is a really well executed dark revivalremake of a classic childrens cartoon i really wasnt expecting this this has drama mystery well know characters as well as new one a great cast and overall good writting it makes the sillydopy cartoon into something else that adults can enjoy i love the creative liberties the writters took in fleshing out wednesday i never though that could be an interesting story as the original character was drab and boring jenna ortega really breathed life into our protagonist this really show really reminds of chilling adventures of sbrina and thats not a bad thing at all it was on its own a pretty good revival i would say both of those shows make a up a new exciting genre of tv check it out well worth it
4,this recipe was super good and easy i believe the yield says twelve but i assure you it would serve many more i brought this up to my cabin during the fourth of july and it really went well with every main dish we made i didnt have cider vinegar or celery so i went without and i still thought it was delicious i would definetely bring it to a potluck to share with friends
4,finally a western weve been waiting for a wild wellwritten western with all the intrigue and political nepotistic backstabbing of game of thrones that should be enough to grab your attention
4,this item works great with the garmin dash cam and garmin hand held topographic gps good valuedeal for the money
4,most peasant tops have a lot of detail at the chest such as gathering yoke inlay ties etc i like this peasant blouse because it has a simple top part so it does not add volume to the chest good for busty figures pretty top though colors a bit more autumnal than pictured
4,odd pic shows carrots but not mentioned in recipe ingredients
4,i was so excited to order this dress however once it arrived i realized that the fit doesnt work for me i carry my weight in my stomach and backside and the dress clung to my trouble areas
4,ive bought similar blouses from retailer before that i didnt love as much as this its not boxy or wide on me its a great length and i find the bell sleeves to be elegant i bought the purple one on sale and went back for the redcream my only complaint would be that the stitching could be of better quality the fabric is very nice love the print
4,very quick to put together and tasted really good will certainly make again
4,this definitely works for you think fabric great quality and im weeks and i think ill be able to use this to the end got my normalish size would never have kept this if i wasnt pregnant cause you can definitely accommodate a pregnancy or maybe go down two sizes if not this is not my first baby either love for my pregnancy
4,warning spoilers always wanted to say thathey im not one to blubber on about tv and stuff but im years old and remember my father taking the family to the nd star wars movie probably the best empire strikes back little did i know that years later it would infact be episode the clever geeks had thought about franchise and story telling like a s and s kid i collected star wars stuff but not nerdy like some of my pals but enough not to be out in the cold my love for the movies is deeply rooted in nostalgia and my siblings sisters with the parents heading to the cinema as a special occasion like a child hood photograph the early star wars movies burn brightly as a reminder of wonderful family outing memories fast forward to being a father hang on feel a line coming on and thrusting upon my kids star wars brilliantly aided by a reboot franchise iiiiii digital dvds and other lucas cuts of the bits he couldnt do because the technology wasnt good enough he rejigged jabba but too late for me as the next generation came along my mob craved harry potter and his buddies that nailed them luke who r what then years later jj turned up movie number great or should i say the rest just so then favreau im now back in the early s again did i mention i literally subscribed to disney just for mando season woooah im back its got rubber puppets more old school animatronics our boy has got spurs and values to top it off weve baby yoda nothing short of compelling every episode is a reboot of characters of a by gone era but a fresh feel and a zippy cast simple story telling in mins no adds that has you gasping for more finally today episode what can i say for those of you have seen it im again tv that prods the emotions stirs the memories that is smart and above all true to its roots move over marvel the king is back to his throne make some space wait hang on what did j fav start mandalorian starwars disneyplus dadlovesstarwars starwarsthemandalorian
4,i watched the film version of the handmaids tale several years ago so the storyline was pretty familiar and the film i might give six or seven stars however in this adaptation i had expected a little more than mere filler to justify the extended length i dont think there was a major plot point which was not in the film both film and television versions seemed very twodimensional it has to be said the dystopian world in which it was set seemed to operate without any explanation of what those in this world who do not occupy one of the roles we see actually do it was a bit like looking at the cardboard set of a cheap scifi movie with banks of unconvincing fake spinning tape reels and purposeless flashing lights the dystopia may have only existed in the lives of the households of the commanders and the lives of the handmaids for all the viewer knew everything else was hidden from view in the film perhaps this was acceptable but in ten hours we learned more about the characters lives in our near present than we did about the world into which they were forced i dont really know why i watched it perhaps i hoped that the dimension missing from the film was going to be furnished but it wasnt
4,i cant value it it was for a gift
4,i would say that this blouse runs sizes too small the fabric is unique its like gauze backed by fine netting and the workmanship is excellent
4,good performance but battery service is low otherwise good product
4,sounds great the photo looks like there are avacado chunks in the soup
4,comes without ms office win shows flawless performance on this hw non tech users may face thermal issues but these can be easily fixed overall im satisfied with this purchase
4,i ordered this in my usual retailer size xspetite and it was too baggy in the bust granted im only a aa but i would still expect it to be a little smaller in the bust at that size the elastic waist was a little loose too i have a waist hips and the inner slip showed a tiny bit like another reviewer said but its the same fabric as the dress the slip is adjustable but its attached to the dress at the waist it wasnt flattering on me in the hips either this was a miss for me b
4,overall performance is good
4,beware the future is now i read margaret atwoods book back in the late s and i thought then that this could actually be our future based on the society which i lived as a young white college educated first generation middleclass female in an immigrant family the original production of the handmaids tale back in seemed almost quaint now that we had fought our way through to freedom but i lived through the civil rights movement as a teenager and i lived through the womens liberation movement as a young adult and i knew how fragile our freedom as women as people of color as intellectuals as individuals was and is this version of the book and the film seems to modernize the story but the truth is unchanging if you think you are safe from the forces of repression and you relax your guard you will be sorry this story can actually become our immediate future we are very close to the tipping point read the book watch the movie view the series and take action
4,i love the concept and it fit nice and looked cozy yet a bit sexy however the material was a tiny bit scratchy and warm so with no long sleeves you would have to wear a sweater or something on top and i was looking for a simple one piece i would have loved this and not returned it if the fabric was soft it should be its all about being cozy
4,decent product
4,i was surprised how good the first season was far better than the tom cruise movies it was interesting funny with a great lead actor and great supporting characters the story was really good and i binged the entire season but the second season is a real disaster in every sense unconvincing boring bad casting of reachers superhero friends i forced myself to watch it till the end and surfing the internet on phone more than looking at the tv screen and i couldnt wait for it to end and i dont want to waste another single word on it like two completely different tv shows i ended up giving it a with the hope that the second season is just a bad dream and that the third season will be like the first
4,this dress is super sweet but also unique with the reversed fabric on the skirt it is true to size unlike a lot of retailer clothes that seem to be boxyrun big the fabric bunches a little bit at the waist though thats my only complaint
4,excellent performance high speed star rating
4,i am currently searching for the perfect pair of white boots to go with this this is so fun i used to wear a lot of vintage clothes and this dress lit the fire again to start looking for cool pieces i tried on my usual size and found that it fit pretty tts it was a bit roomy in the hips but considering the cut of the dress i assume that to be intentional for reference i am lbs d and bought a size
4,the colors werent what i expected either the dark blue is much more vibrant and i just couldnt find anything to really go with it fabric is thick and good quality has nice weight and movement to it the skirt just wasnt for me in the end
4,overall i like this sweater but it does have a couple flaws the sweater looks better snapped unfortunately it only has one snap on the frontthere should be another one inside after a couple wears my snap started to come loose probably because it pulls so much the sweater is a bit oversized and i probably ordered the wrong size im and lbs i ordered a medium should have ordered a small all that being said i still love the look and color moss green of the sweater and would
4,i ordered this piece online and returned it at the store a few days after arrival the material is very soft and well made however it is not flattering on the hourglass or pear shaped person moreover if you are short the design may make you look shorter i am and it did to me the design is beautiful if you are tall and have narrow hips this is the piece for you i am lbs and usually wear a sm
4,i think the people who dont enjoy the intricacies of human relations will find the show boring the beautiful interplay of characters and the various plot lines keep you engaged and curious you care about the people and wonder how they evolved into who they are genius writing and direction by mike white make this a total gem the acting is superb and the cinematography and sound track is captivating and you feel immersed and transported into this intriguing other world each season introduces story lines that engage you from the start and leave you guessing as to what will come next i have discovered when you rewatch the episodes you pick up on things you missed and your appreciation for the characters and story line grows
4,these are very cute and i bought both colors they are accurately pictured however right out of the bag they had an especially strong chemicaltype odor must be the dye i have been airing them outside in the sun trying to decide if i will keep them they seem to be calming down a bit but its been two days they are not jersey but are a nonstretchy type fabric with a slight sheen dress up or down im a or and the xs fit well
4,i initially started watching this series and was immediately hooked by murray bartletts performance as armond the hotel manager he is really what made season great however i didnt much enjoy anyone elses story lines as they all felt a bit like the loose ends were never really tied up and none of the characters were particularly likeable or interesting moving onto season and i much preferred this to the first season the cast as a whole felt a lot stronger than season and i preferred how much the stories intertwined i also much preferred the only returning character in season as opposed to them in the first season do no listen to the reviews saying that season isnt worth it it definitely is i particularly enjoyed the story following the two couples of theo james and meghann fahy aubrey plaza and will sharpe it felt realistic and was played out brilliantly some really great performances all round and well worth a watch
4,great story fantastic characters and film making plus obviously baby yoda is the best thing to happen to the star wars franchise in a long time and it was a great franchise to begin with pedro pascal is brilliant as the mandalorian take my with my thanks for too notch entertainment
4,i cut the sugar to cup i would not do that again it was not sweet enough i would also swape one cup flour for one cup cornmeal
4,intel i gen in this price is quite good others brand charging k more for same configuration
4,at about kcal this is definitely no soup for a caloriecontrolled diet
4,i was not a fan of star wars especially after the later movies of course i watched them but it was more of taking my kids to cinema they are repeatedly the same story a family with bad and good members but this series on disney is really something else it is amazing it even made me reread the canon of star wars universe the plot and storytelling are very good up to the last moment i found only one episode in the whole series that is pretty weak they brought up the star wars properties slowly here and there enough to make it good but not overdoing and the last episode of season two is just amazing i cannot tell too much without spoilers it is a must watch even if you are not a fan of star wars my only little complaint is sometimes some dark scenes and episodes are hard to watch on some televisions especially on a budget tv in a well lit room lucky i also have a premium set and only on this set i can really enjoy the show as this is targeted at streaming service i hope the movie makers pay a bit of attention to this
4,i had to bake at least to minutes to get some browning on the top this did not overbake them on the bottom if i make again i will omit the almond flavoring in the icingi took them to work and the reviews were that they were great
4,the cake is great one of the best chocolate cakes ive ever had however i am surprised how many good reviews there are on the frosting i didnt like the taste of it others i served it to liked it but i could taste the sour cream i think a homemade buttercream would be delicious on this cake
4,this is such a beautiful top i sized down from a large to medium and it fits but too long and full for my shape also found the armholes too deep and revealing for my large bust sadly returning
4,this shirt runs boxy but the print is as cute as it looks online
4,acer company is too bad i m using for coding purpuse but application not working now and acer service center is not available in my area services not provide acer company so i u have any leptop so one of the best company is hp go for it
4,wow i feel like i went trough a million emotions watching this episode and the whole first season i havet cried this much from watching a tv show in years this show has heart and soul and it really touches you the pace is perfect the acting is amazing and every scene is exciting and emotional i really dont understand the bad reviews because this show is amazing and a must watch especially for women this episode was one of my favorites it felt like the show just kept getting better and better with every episode
4,i purchased the blue and its a wonderful deep blueish purple i like the chiffon detail which makes it a bit more stylish than a normal tee fits nicely a bit big but not enough to go down a size the material is not sheer and a nice light weight
4,i love this shirt but have issue that darn pocket its so awkward it even looks awkward on the model then i bought another tshirt by the same company from elsewhere and guess what same awkward weird floppy pocket its so odd i cant even explain it
4,very good value for money laptop
4,my favorite macaroni and cheese recipe
4,i used a whole egg since i did not have egg substitute my kids did hnot like the tomato mixture but my husband and i enjoyed it all would like adding balsamic to it next time as another reviewer suggested
4,theres no support for linux theres no user guide proper and customer care is not upto expectation on technical queries otherwise a beautiful work machine suitable for people with moderate technical knowledge
4,ordered this jacket on line it is picture perfect does run a little big thought i would take a small but im exchanging for xs
4,i buy veg stock cubes in big batches but this week bought more and not as strong flavour not sure if youve blanded the recipebut not as good needs looking into as will start looking elsewhere
4,it is very moisturizing it has such a pretty scent it as well keeps my skin moisturizer all day long
4,easy to usenon stick and bulit wellwould buy again no questionhope it last longer than the lastonly issue is its longevitylast one lasted less than yearsfor that price it should last longer
4,i bought this cardigan online and loved it as soon as it arrived i bought it on my usual small but it fit very big this is a nice unusual looking cardi and has a very sporty style so i wouldnt use it in the office the material is very soft and slightly on the thin side i am and lbs i had to return it because the small was too big and couldnt find a xs at the store or online size down
4,thick and creamy smelt fresh
4,dictatorship series is all in all very good and interesting worth watching it theme is im afraid near future plot is really ok the only thing that bothers me during whole show especially in season is slowness too slow scenes too slow characters movements everything is too slow and it can be very annoying because of that to me annoying slowness my rate is
4,this top is comfortable and pretty plus i like the extra length in the sleeves it is very lightweight and im cold natured so i wear a bra top tankini underneath for warmth
4,this show was entertaining but not in the exhilarating way that say strike back was in a similar genre also reachers steady flow of brilliant sherlock holmeslike conclusions from obscure facts hunches was a bit ridiculous as was the doubledigit body count of bad guys hes able to leave behind with no consequences whatsoever that said its not easy to hold an audiences attention for hours and this does that so if i could id give it a rather than just a or maybe even a as willa fitzgerald is just so damn cute
4,season was a solid score for me i loved the world the characters the drama the suspense season continued the story well a solid or in season the story started to feel a little thrown together with characters doing things that went against their previous development or that didnt make sense it felt like plot was more important to the writers yet that season was also slowmoving in terms of plot id score it a rating season is where it completely fell apart though characters act completely against character and sense for no reason other than plot season is also dark at times in a way thats not suspenseful just depressing season is a score of a at best im quitting the show but ill give it an overall for a strong first two seasons
4,ive never made macaroons before and i made these twice in hours i have a couple of cookie events coming up and had coworkers try them they raved about them i did cut the sugar drastically only because i dipped them in chocolate which added a lot of sweetness congrats on your blue ribbon
4,the flavor is excellent but like others i must say that i coud not get the center done which is the reason for stars instead of i agree with the person who suggested baking it in two smaller loaves the crusty top is a real plus
4,brilliant performance at this price starts up in secs closes in display is not up to mark
4,this appears much more pink in person im not really a pink girl but thought id try the way the shoulders are cut makes my defined shouldersarms look too intense for my liking this would look nicer on someone more petite and less athletic in my opinion i like that the bust has slight padding that can make a bra unnecessary for yoga spin pilates ballet or barre class its nice and fitted and true to size would be really cute on the right person
4,we like this recipe as its very tasty and different i added diced celery and bell pepper since i was out of the green chilis and added an extra can of beans my husband really liked it
4,great microsd fast and holds a ton of memory if you really need one buy it and you wont be disappointed
4,the top is a pretty design its a low vneck but it would be nice for layering it was just way to tight runs small order up a size
4,very useful for surface pro to increase capacity from gb can also be used as backup in case something goes wrong
4,i know im about to get a lot of unhelpful ratings but i was convinced to watch andor despite not really caring for any star wars ip beyond the original trilogy due to the extensive praise im writing this review for others who may be in a similar position the hype for andor is that its better darker and more complex than other entries in the star wars extended universe and thats what convinced me to give it a try i enjoyed the show but it didnt live up to the glowing reviews for me my biggest issue was that most of the characters felt more like archetypes than individuals this is a common complaint about star wars properties but the sheer volume of faces names and imaginary languagescultures made it hard for me to feel fully invested in most of the shows characters most of the time it just felt like a bunch of a tropes recycled from wwii stories this is a real issue in a show organized around the theme of personal sacrifice for example were supposed to be moved that bix and cassian give up their budding romance for the rebellion but we see very little of their relationship theyre exes who still care in season one and then they get back together married even somewhere between seasons why what attracted them to each other in the first place similarly we never get much insight into what motivates the imperial couple beyond a desperate desire for approval they were denied as children there were some action sequences that stood out i really enjoyed the final three episodes of season two and the season one episode set in prison i was also impressed with alex lawther ebon mossbarach fiona shaw and kathryn harns performances they gave their characters some real personality despite not having much screentime genevieve reilly and stellan skarsgard did the same in the main cast in the end its a solid showi think my rating reflects thatand im not sorry i watched but id never in a million years call it the best show of and im honestly baffled by all of the people who say they love it despite not being big star wars fans i guess epic space operas just arent for me
4,great storyline so far and excellent special effects as expected from the iconic lucas film team
4,product is good considering the price i bought at k including yrs extended warranty with adp it takes hrs for initial setup after the restart an error occurred however i did a reset and now it is working fine cons fan running with humming sound even in low cpuram usage the keyboard could be a little broader to utilize the full space however youll soon get used to it ill update after a month
4,my first hand laptop but hiting problam
4,im happy i bought this top its very cute and almost a little immaturechildish but with the right bottoms it looks classy i found it to run large so i sized down one size and it fits good though the straps can feel a little tight if it rides up it washes beautifully will probably not work on large chested women
4,this dress is a lovely fit the knit top accentuates the bust and the loose skirt below the empire waist just skims the figure its pretty casual and the skirt is a tiny bit sheer so better for weekends than for office wear
4,elegant look its good performance is good the camera just okay all the things good like ram copilot etc even though dolby atmos available the sound is little bit low during charging software updation its heat generation is heavy to face
4,i didnt think this was going to be any good so i kept skipping it them one night i clicked on the st season episode i was hooked when i saw jennifer coolidge i was hooked season was so good i binged the entire seasons then season i didnt expect to see jennifer coolidge in season i thought it was going to be a whole new story line with all new cast the story with jennifer coolidge character continued this is the best show i have seen in a long time i keep rewatching both seasons you cannot judge a book by the cover or the name you have to watch this at first season started off slow but omg when you find out what these gays are up to with jennifer coolidge character its insane this show is insanely good give it a try you wont regret it it sucks you in you will end up binge watching both seasons theo james is not the good guy in this season i was hoping my theo james was gonna be a good guy but its so good all the different stories going on at once its like a modern day soap oprah its crazy crazy crazy in a wonderful way i tip my hats to the writers and all the stars the ones i didnt know i became a fan of all of them many surprises dont want to spoil it by giving away anything but i knew jennifer coolidge husband was no good it was too good to be true at first i liked him but in season you will hate him it kills me what the gays did to jennifer coolidge character thats it im done i cannot wait for season i cannot wait to see what they come up with i hope tanya comes back for season even if its just a ghost but he could back it up and say she actually survived but i doubt it they could go backwards in life if they want to keep tanya thats the only way he could keep jennifer coolidge in the upcoming seasons is to back up the story to her past i know there is no way that mike white is not going to keep jennifer coolidge in the entire upcoming seasons is to go backwards i just cannot see mike white not giving us a surprise he lives jennifer coolidge they are best friends she will be a ghost or he will go backwards in time to show her parents possibly just a theory i pray she is not done because jennifer coolidge is the only reason i watched season she carried this entire project season had the worst actors i liked the hotel staff and the prostitutes more than the main cast jennifer coolidge carried them all the gay mafia they were pretty good also
4,awsome laptop with awsome features gaming at high fps camera qualitya not good
4,andor was every bit as good as i was hoping for it might be the best star wars series to date i used to think it was the mandalorian but these two seasons of andor have been flawless of all the star wars series so far this one is probably the least known character but that doesnt mean its any less interesting andor is a character from one of the best star wars movies rogue one all the reviews have been great for andor so that got my expectations even higher and so far theyve all been met it has a real gritty feel to it compared to the other star wars series and the visuals are great its also more adult oriented compared to the other shows so far but the cast led by diego luna is the best thing about this show well that and the writing these two seasons of andor have been nothing short of incredible and easily the best thing star wars has done since the original trilogy
4,the dress i received is adorable however the color is much more subdued than shown in the catalog
4,this sweater is pretty the cut is very flattering both colors are nice i ordered both but i decided to reutn both only because i have enough sweaters and live in southern california otherwise say go for it it is well made and woud definitely keep me warm i also like the mock neck the long sleeve hem and contrasting colors i tried on petite xs which was perfect for me lbs
4,very comfy and easily could dress down or up
4,the print on this top is even more gorgeous in person the fit was great and the removable halter strap is always a plus this swim top however doesnt have padding and the material is slightly thin so this could cause an issue for some overall however it looked great for reference i am an a cup and purchase the small
4,this t shirt is huge i am tall size xs and i am swimming in this xs im trying a size down it is meant to be oversized but this is extreme
4,i took a chance and watched this series based on the high imdb score and was really surprised how much i enjoyed it i thought it might be a teen series but it actually wasntit was well thought out visually stunning and a great twist at the end that i didnt see comingwell done i can see it left it open for a second series and i cant wait jenny ortega as wednesday was mesmerisingly fantastic and all the characters were cast perfectly i particularly loved wednesday enid and bianca really strong performances on a negative and only reason i didnt give this a score of was because i dont think catherine zeta jones as morticia addams was convincing enoughher acting is a bit mediocre and am sure someone else could have played the part much better i also kept looking at her face and thinking why does she look so dry and have a powdery complexion i know she is goth like but she just looked too old christina ricci was superb in her role and am very glad i watched the series
4,i have used this with sony camcorder for more than a year now it works well and copes with the high data volume of a camcorder video
4,has the feel of the books this going to be a mst watch for me as soon as the new episodes come out alan ritchson is the living embodiment of jack reacher if you like the book series you will love the series
4,the fabric is soft and the colors are bright it fits well over the shoulders and the neckline is placed just right on the chest the bottom portion of the tank is more of a swing style item than a form fitting tank i am very pleased with the top and will wear it often
4,my now lates son has been spoton in his recommendations for programs for me to watch since he said id love men in black xena when he was in high school it led to the family calling me dr xena then a cmas present of a doll wthat moniker consisting of a dr barbie on a horse holding a silver serving dish as a shield in one hand a sword in the other i helped him with his elementaryaged kids last year for mos when he became single which took as much energy as when oddly he and his siblings were the same ages and i was yes its true in rd year medical school therefore i had a tv at the end of my bed so i could continue living as in the olden days as child puts the era of when daddy was his age i existed in prehistory my son suggested i watch the witcher i was hooked at first it is a bit difficult to keep some of the characters straight but that is often true of many such shows it has been awhile since i watched it so i cant give any spoilers what i can best say is it is well written with good continuity from start to finish everything makes what theyd say on turner classic movies movie sense because of course what they are doing would not happen in reality but it makes perfect sense in the fiction world its actionfilled and has enough supernatural aspects to be fun but not the type of thing to make some grandmas fear their teenaged grandchildren are going to hell in a handbasket because the devil is sure to get them if they watch this show realize im saying this as both the grandma of gkids aged and a very committed christian i follow as god leads me at all times god had me become a dr in my s then had me stop just before the i grandkid arrived turned out i was greatly needed to help care for each of those children for individual needs they had just like the witcher shows up when needed so does god guide us if we pay attention
4,its not very good but theres not exactly anything to compare it to so it can stand alone as a fantasy story with rushed cgi and confusing skittish story that makes sets up something then delivers nothing that and i know henry cavill is an ass in real life and hes not particularly a good performer so he ruins something that might have had a chance to be interesting without him
4,things i dont like in this laptop ie air vents are pointing towards the screen so the right bottom side of the screen is getting hot the screen refresh rate is just hz which should at least hz
4,watched succession but hated every character in the show so didnt care what happened to them so lost interest yellowstone is exactly the opposite i care about virtually every character in the show so am totally invested in the storyline they slowly give us clues as to why the different characters are so flawed in succession they basically argue these are rich so they must be spoilt and crazy without exploring the individual
4,the stitching is why i like this dress even though the arms and waist were a little large on me i decided to keep it because of the beautiful pattern i think going a size down from what i normally wear would be too tight across my back or too short i will wear it with a cardigan tights and boots as the weather gets cooler
4,i bought this for only one use to put in my samsung galaxy s i popped in the card mounted and formatted in settings and it works like a charm in the phone howeverits in caps pay attention when i took it out of the phone and put the microsd into the sd adapter and plugged into the sd card slot on the front of my pcwin x it asked to format the cardwas already formatted by phone so was confused so i hit ok no biggie it was empty anyways windows did its thing and when it was ready to use it said the card was only mbit showed gb in the phone so my troubleshooting section of mind kicked in and i removed the card and i just so happen to have a microsd slot in my computers frontal bay and it wouldnt even show it was connected in windows explorer so i took it out and put in another microsd card voila it read switched them out again and nothing so i decided to pull up my paragon hard disk utility and it showed the same thing as windows regardless how i tried formatting it i gave up and put it back in the phone and mounted itmy s said it neded to be formatted so i formatted it in the phone again and it showed just like it did the first time gb i then proceeded to install samsung kies and got my phone hooked up to my pc via usb cable i opened the phone in windows explorer and right there it shows the phone memory at gb and the sd card at gbim not quite sure whats going on with that because the sd slots in my pc read my other cards just fine but anyway i guess if you plan on using it in your phone or possibly other device exclusively because i can use it like a charm while its in my phone otherwise it seems pretty useless so i guess just depends on what youre using it for on a side not be careful when you open the plastic package that contains the micro sd and sd adapter be sure to open it over a large clear area i opened it up the the living room with black tile floor and had to get a flashlight to find it when it jumped out on the holderit just sets in the little plastic holder so even the slightest shake will send it flying when opening im giving it on here but if youre getting it for a phone galaxy s at least because it works fine in mine
4,i was afraid it would be too poufy but it isnt at all id say it runs a bit large i usually wear a or and the fits perfectly
4,gorgeous dress but fits really large ordered a petite large going to send it back and try the petite medium wish it was available at my store to try on and not have to wait for it to be reshipped
4,there are a lot of boiled wool sweaters and jackets available right nowthis is not one of my favorites while the color is amazing the buttons are very cheap plastic and they look that way the are very close together which is hard to button up the coat is not flattering in the same way it is on the model when it is opened an requires to be closed to have an hourglass shape however sizing down which would also fix this problem would cause the shoulderarm area to be too tight
4,these jeans are wellmade the cut is decently flattering but on more muscular thighs it would look nicer if the cuff was a bit higher the petite on me was just below the ankle so it just looks like i folded my jeans because they were too long if you are taller or have longer legs mine are short on my short height then i think these would be great i dindt find them particularly small but htey were snug muscular thighs overall ok but returning them p ordered lbs in
4,this is a great dress that i wear to work but would also wear to a cocktail party or wedding it rides up a tiny but but is long enough that i feel completely comfortable it is tiny up top so id recommend ordering up if you have any chest im lbs bra size b and it was a twoperson job to get the bodice zipped
4,good average battery not so good
4,this dress is really pretty but the fit is off it is not fitted at the waist which made the back look poofy also the arm length is not flattering it needs to be either longer or shorter additionally if one was to wear it a lot the felting might start to fray
4,good value for money performance is quite good no lag it wakes up in a second keyboard should have been better
4,this top is beautiful and i really wanted to be able to keep it ive tried it on times it is not for bigchested girls ddd it hangs like im months pregnant because the top area lands on top of my chest sadly this will be going back it is beautiful and flowing and a perfect weight
4,had a blast watching it the actors were really good the action scenes were well made i feel like this show was solid with tying up loose ends as well which is nice for once would watch again
4,overall build quality is very good though it is a plastic build performance is decent for regular day to day task not for heavy usage battery life around hours with normal usage display quality is also not good as compare to ips display it has gb mhz ram which is not considerable in thats why performance is little bit slow keyboard is good but visibility is not very good touchpad is smooth and responsive overall software experience is good it should be value for mo read more
4,i automatically knocked off one star because every brand that offers size xs and many also offer xxs should also care about us size xls as well i ordered a size large and of course it shows every bump and love handle in back but i recreated a look from my local retailers window they showed a long unbuttoned cotton weave dress over this crochet dress the closest dress pictured online to what i saw is the mabli maxi dress but imagine it opened if it had buttons and in blue with
4,i will say from the start this isnt a series for everyone its different theres tons of character development and its a show id find much more enjoyable binge watching then consuming one episode per week ive grown to love limited series immediately there is a start and end point set out from the get go theres no cliffhangers written with no exact conclusion in mind or series that goes on way past its shelf life this series is so well done it gives you a definitive acceptable conclusion that leave little if anything to conclude its great when a season of episodes ends and it leaves you begging for more however its also great to watch a short series that tells its story while manages to leave no stone on turned and youre satisfied with its ending and enjoyed it in a lot of ways i believe this series left a wonderful blueprint for future limited series to come
4,the product is descent in price range
4,noce product
4,the only difference in your and my recipe is i like to ad a tsp on cloves and tsp nutmeg for a real holiday flavor and i throw in a cup of raisins too
4,we live in the golden era of tveven the worst tv show can be decent and a mediocre tv show can be considered good if a large amount of people overrateoverhype it and decide that it is a good show even though it really isnt that is the case with the witcher ive read a lot of the positive reviews and almost all of them are from people who either have played the video games or have watched game of thrones and for some reason they think it is like got so it has to be goodreading about how great this show isand that its a mix of got and tlotr makes me question my existence and wonder what is wrong with todays humanity to be more specificepisode was so boring that i almost quit watchingbut i always finish the shows i start no matter how bad they are so i kept watchingmany others have pointed the fact that henry cavill as geralt carries the show and thats absolutely true everything else is just mediocreyou cant compare this show to gotgot is a show while this is at bestthe bad adaptations of video games continue even though seeing the audience score for this show which is would make you believe otherwise i cant say much moreim stunned by those who praise this showas i said before those who praise it are either gamers that love the witcher video games or got fans who think that this show will fill their void now that got has endedall in all this show is mediocre at bestbasic tiring cheaplooking at times unintelligent and unintelligible
4,the show is amazing it really makes you thing where this country stand and how it is possible to face such horrible reality season is awesome but after season the show is dragging on and on milking the character until there is nothing left to watch
4,super cute tshirt keep in mind to is fairly long
4,the screen gets darkened viewed from sides on other aspects this is a good choice
4,salty i doubled the recipe and used only teaspoons of salt in total and it was still way too much these are good but the salt is distracting
4,it is gorgeous and yes the side slits are very high but i am still keeping and rocking it i am a size and got the large probably could have got the medium but after a few washings i think the larger size will be ok side slits high but if the weather is good and you have self tanner on legs it looks great with shortie boots i have gotten many cmpliments on it just hope it still keeps its shape after a long day of wear very pretty in cream though i do recommend it i am
4,i doubled all the veggies used half and half instead of milk and added one cup of sharp cheddar mmmm mmmm good
4,never spent this much on a dress so it needs to be amazing for me to keep it ive never seen flannel patterns and colors like this the details in the back are unique but in the end i decided to return because its too long and although it fit fine in a size large it didnt look that great on me the dress has an exaggerated drop waist that was too low for my short waisted frame the fabric smells odd i tried belting it but the pockets and back buttons created bulk
4,i own a first generation microsoft surface pro and it has been a good machine but i was really finding it challenging working within the constraint of gb of storage space i had a gb class sdxc card which worked well but was not going to fit the vmware virtual machine i wanted to run off the sd storage the virtual machine increases in size with regular use and the operating system i was running is recommended for at least gb of max storage to operate properly combined with the files i needed to store and gb memory chip was no longer sufficientthe sandisk ultra gb microsdxc class memory card was able to handle that with ease however i have found that the virtual machine ran noticeably faster off the gb chip than this one ive actually ordered a second of these to see if i might have just received a flawed chip if the replacement chip offers improvement i will revise this review it provides its main selling point more storage at a relatively low cost so far has run reliably in my tablet computerif storage space is a significant issue for your device and the memory can make use of gb sdxc then i would recommend product
4,the fabric design of these shorts is so great i dont adore the fit they are a little short waisted for my long torso and the leg openings flare out more than i prefer and are about inch longer than i would like but i can fix the inseam issue by hemming them i may still pick them up just because i love the fabric so much
4,i bought this blouse in ivory which is almost white just as pictured its pretty sheer as shown in the pics and the cotton lace insets show the top and straps of my bra despite this im keeping the blouse and will sort out how to wear it because its so unusual and gorgeous if black looks good on you its bad on me id probably go with that colorway over the ivory because its easier to blend a black bra with a black blouse than a nude bra with an almost white blouse the blouse runs
4,i gave this stars instead of five because the picture really does give you the impression that this cardigan has sleeves but actually its a cape with a few stitches above the wrist its also quite short im only and it hits me above my waist this picture was clearly shot with the front pulled down i bet if we saw the back it would be high above her waist also one of the buttons fell off the first time i wore it i heard it fall thankfully so it was easy enough to sew back on but
4,great sweater but it was just a little too short on me so it is going back it is extremely fuzzy and soft though
4,super cute cotton is substantial enough not to show bra lines but light enough to be summery breezy i misread xs and tried it on thinking it was a medium oddly theres barely any difference among the xs s and m sizesthe buttons didnt even buckle out across my bust on the smaller sizesso this top could be a nice ego boost if you want to size down i got the m anyway armholes not too big ruffle hides any tummy flaws great with jeans shorts and skirtslike a perfect white
4,i got this laptop at k in bbd sale and for the price its quite good not the best not the worst tough it looks are preety great better than nitro v
4,this dress is a great casual outfit tha fabric is substantial and very soft the only negative would be it is a little large through the chestarms i ordered a large as i am curvy but would like to exchange for a medium sadly the medium is sold out but i love the dress so much i am keeping it
4,i purchased this dress off the reviewsunfortunately i have to return it i expected it to fit as they said i am lbs bc i got the s petite i could not even get this dress on over my chest the waist was on top of my chest i really was disappointed the material is so soft i would have had to purchase a m in a regular to fit me and it would have looked terrible on me so i would say for a tall thin girl yes a short girl a no and i am very petite
4,sound quality is average other than this everything is awesome
4,i thought this was love at first sight the color and design are both stunning and it drapes just perfectly over the body without looking like a tent and the fabric feels nice but the very first time i put it on it snagged on my fingernail and my nails are kept short and neat this wouldnt have been a problem except that the snag is very obvious this material seems like its going to snag on every single thing i didnt dare even try on a necklace for this reason im really undecided o
4,adorable plush very soothingmelodie soft and long my monthold baby makes it work alonedamage that the batteries do not last long
4,ok lets be very real its very hard to create true realism through the lens of fantasy but this first episode really captured the details of such a world hbo are masters of details what this adaptation need more as it goes forward is very good dialogue actings tensionand story to surpass the world they created i hope they will as this it is an incredible start of a new show for the people that have not played the games i can tell you that the story gets better and better with every episode and it could possibly turn out to be one of the greatest tv shows of all times if they focus of those details its all in the details
4,i made this for dinner tonight and everyone enjoyed it the sauce was so good what i liked most is that it didnt required canned soup i used my own chicken broth and next time i will make my own crust i prefer to cook from scratch and not used processed food so good and perfect for a chilly night
4,i believe the use of the music in episode nearly overpowering the dialogue in some sections was intentionally done to further enhance the unsettling mood of the entire episode theres a lot bubbling under the surface of these characters and its about to start boiling over soon if you dont like many of these characters and find them hard to root for thats intentional too mike white writes characters that challenge you and leave you feeling conflicted he wants us to have an inner dialogue with ourselves as we watch as to whats around the corner i can pretty much guarantee you we have no idea unless youve read the scripts but fasten your seatbelts its gonna be a bumpy ride
4,i am and lbs and ordered a size the dress fit perfectly in the shoulders and arms and below the waist but i could barely fit my a size chest in the dress the other reviewers are not kidding about the chest area being very narrow i have had to order a size instead well see if that works
4,it was a very good but episodes are a little bit short and episode count less too except this cgi cast actors and actresses were good story based on addams family and wednesday really i loved this family also i didnt see wednesday blinked during series im already waiting for second season some people says its same with other netflix series sabrina yes it too similar but in my opinion wednesday is better references are good too series songs good enough but so many people died and wednesday kicked from nevefmore academi in first season and i dont know what will they do in second season thats why i am already waiting for second season
4,some quick notes it is not sheer like a previous poster was asking there is a lining the color is darker than it appears online which was ok with me i thought it still looked nice as a deeper gold i was excited about this top and thought it was the perfect thing for a casualfestive company holiday party i ordered a m and am usually between m and s in most retailer items unfortunately it fit me rather boxy and short i have a larger bust g and it draped in a very unflattering way m
4,despite using sure for years he does not like this one
4,loved this sweater but too boxy
4,as soon as i saw this blouse in the store i fell in love with it i thought it was a little too expensive for what it was but hey thats antho for you i luckily had a gift card and a off bday promo so i got it at a good discount i love the fit of it sometimes buttondown tops like this are too tight in the arms or pulls too much around the chest and this one doesnt when i do wear it i have to be conscious of the buttons because it can be a little gappy in between the buttons when
4,im not a big fan of elisabeth moss but the show is good if i had to start over from the beginning i definitely couldnt this show is emotionally exhausting and tends to feel like the story is going in circles at times ive been watching since the beginning though and ill see it through i look forward to when new episodes come out my biggest gripe is the lighting i dont know why so many showsfilms come out that are edited to look so dim i understand that is the look they are going for and it makes sense in flashbacks or specific scenes but this show does it a lot and its so distracting when you can barely see anything
4,the expected hauntingly macabre humour and the dark mischievous wit is no where to be seen its too tamed too soft too dull and too blandly predictable to be enjoyable the show has sucked out every bit of morbid sense and left it with a generic vanilla teen murder mystery show emo girl wannabe detective with her unknown powers and her trusted preppy sidekick trying to solve a something years old mystery and you guessed it a prophecy involving her dun dun duuuun honestly its like veronica mars meets scooby doo meets monster high set in a dupe hogwarts i suppose i should be thankful that they didnt make her an orphan to the boot honestly hardcore addams fans know that the paranormal and supernatural is something that was supposed to be uniquely addams their whole charm was that they were the oddballs in a normal world wednesday being in a society of likes makes it less whimsical and more bland to think that i had such high expectations for something that turned out to be nothing but a lackluster grated teen fantasy this show could have had soo much potential and yet it was squandered away by its too many nonaddams characters not even jenna ortega who was doing an admirable job as wednesday can save this show tim burton has lost his touch
4,this bikini bottom is great design and quality but runs small overall i would recommend
4,the number pad lock button is hard and works inconsistently
4,i just received this top it is stunningly beautiful however i will be returning it as it is very large i am tall at and typically wear a size i purchased this in the size s but it was very large i should have read the reviews about sizing before ordering although i think both the xxs and xs were already sold out

4,i agree that this blouse is boxy but because its not too long in length it evens it out any longer or shorter would make it look too boxy its great for work to dinner during the week goes great with jeans too

4,this simple shower gel is a clear gel that lathers up really really well so you dont have to use much to feel clean as like other simple products it doesnt have perfume so its pretty much odourless with a hint of cucumber smell it feels really natural whilst also making me feel clean so will definitely be buying again this review was collected as part of a promotion
4,im upset because for the price of the dress i thought it was embroidered no that is a print on the fabric i think i cried a little when i opened the box it is still ver pretty i would say it is true to size it is a tad bit big on me but i am very tiny but i can still get away with it the color is vibrant the style is unique skirt portion is pretty poofy i keep going back and forth on it mainly because of the price although the quality is definitely there except i wish it were emb
4,as most have already commented runs small in upper body im always a or petite max aa athletic build the petite s was exceptionally small in upper body and no chance of it stretching enough to be comfortable since i read other reviews before purchasing i also ordered the petite m pm was too big under arms i exchanged both and purchased a regular s in store fits great though would have liked it a mere shorter the sizing should have been etc im keeping the
4,great leggings theyre well made and comfortable to wear my only complaint is that they seem to be stretching just a little and dont fit perfectly
4,i love this brand they produced a number of incredibly cute blouses in and ive missed their quirky designs this shirt does not run small i am usually a and have a little extra room in the chest area even though im a dd the arms are the perfect length as well which is nice as i have long arms the only reason i did not give it five stars is that i wish it was a bit more fitted through the stomach area its very billowy i may take it to the tailor so cute though on a side
4,we love this recipe any one i make this for loves it and asks for it i would give it stars but for one thing as delicious as it is i think it is much improved with the addition of some cilantro
4,henry cavill plays geralt spot on the story line is good as i feel the way the timeline is in the story is a bit confusing to start with however with that being said i cant wait until for a s as i want to see how the total story will unfold as s was left on a cliff hanger the sword fighting is brilliant to watch and see how much of a beast geralt is i really liked the scenes between geralt and jaskier yennefer and tiassaia as it built up relationships and characters up
4,these are darling love flannel and pattern which is very upbeat wish they were a little more peggedslimtapered at the bottoms
4,very tasty and kid friendly
4,im mths post partum so my belly is still flabby the elastic is too tight on my waist i wish this was looser with a drawstring to tighten i have to return it
4,i orderd this product in a size large because i was afraid of it being seamless would make it too tight on my larger chest ddd however the opposite happened because it doesnt have any kind of seams it is very boxy and not skin tight like i expected however it still works because it does fit me around my chest comfortably and when worn under something it gives a nice blouson effect also the v is a very nice depth not too deep or too shallow overall im happy with it because its a n
4,as a father of hardcore gamers and thinking that donkey kong jr was the last cool game i didnt expect anything but was ready for this weeks opening episode even that i didnt know anything of this original game it was a marvelous start of a trip through america after their unavoidable apocalypseactors cinema direction the storytelling it is all of very high standard we know that for a few years from al lot of productions from netflix amazon prime disney but hbo is the only capable to make something that is not only good it is really great cinema cant wait for the rest of this serie thanks
4,many similarities to the s western series except this time the barclays have transformed into the duttons a dark minded psychotic family with no morals only money seems to matter barbara stanwick has been replaced by kevin costner a rancher who is willing to use his daughters dark side to do her evil so that he can save his ranch all in all most of the characters in this series are people kids should never look up to as far as mentors go dont get me wrong its an entertaining series the acting is solid the scenery is spectacular i spent some time in montana and watching it makes me homesick while the big valley may be too sugar coated yellowstone is the polar opposite i love watching kevin costner act hes gifted good looking and charming i mean what man wouldnt want to be him however john dutton on the other hand is not someone i would ever aspire to be
4,i love these pants i actually bought them twice the special dye in them did not agree with my detergent so i bought another pair on salesome woolite and will wash them inside outhang to dry will take better care of my second pair
4,this show is just what i was looking for with so much not so good stuff to watch at the moment the white lotus was a welcomed addition to my list murray bartlett is just fantastic the quality of the show is very high typical hbo the story line is gripping both funny and dramatic and generally its a great watch hoping there will be a season
4,i liked the simple styling of these jeans when i saw them in the store the price is right considering what some jeans cost today unfortunately these are made in china that bummed me out they run a tad bit small but in the end i think they are more true to size because they give especially in the waist the higher waist is a nice change its nice to be able to skip a belt the denim is a bit rough after air drying so i hope it softens up
4,very good flavor and easy
4,i wanted to love this the color in the picture is pretty truetolife the top fit well if a bit smaller than usual but the skirt piece was way too flared for my petite frame it was too voluminous compared to the top of the dress the material is very soft but thin and is lined which was a pleasant surprise sadly a return for me
4,if you happen to get a size that fits you you will love these leggings they are true to size when the quality control works i got pair both in size one fits perfectly and the other fits like my mothers high waisted jeans the material is very soft and comfortable also not sure who named these colors but the grey is really light purple and the dark grey is dark purple
4,i had really high hopes for this dress based on the reviews im on the curvier side but was surprised to find that my usual size was very loose and long the hem hit just below my knee instead of feeling sexy the weird fit just made me feel matronly im going to exchange for a petite which will hopefully be a little more figurehugging and not as long despite my fit issues the design is stunning intricate and unusual im hoping that the new size will do it more justice
4,i used about cups of pretzels to fit the x dish to get enough base to cover bottom of dish i found it interesting that it only called for the boiling water to make the jello but it worked the jello box calls for two cups boiling and two cups ice cold water my guess is person who commented they had too much jello followed recipe on jello box and not this recipe i sliced up frozen strawberries as i didnt have presliced and added them when not completely thawed to act as substitute for cold water and it worked the jello doesnt look as pretty as picture but that may be because i let it sit too long to gel in freezer
4,falls nicely pretty peachy pink color darker than pictured bought sz l lbs am busty very nice fabric prone to wrinkles
4,to be honest i had a hard time imagining henry cavill as the witcher after watching episodes im having a hard time imagining someone else filling the role shoutout to henry for his great performance
4,good looking
4,nice product with in budget
4,according to price its ok sleek design performance is overall ok dont expect too much from this laptop you may feel a bit overheating because there are no fans for cooling best for students for studies and browsing over laptop is ok according to price
4,nice product thank you flipkart
4,a bit too much spinach for my husband and me i think i will substitute some zucchini next time other than that it was easy to prepare and tasty to eat leftovers were even better
4,ill try not to spoil anything but for a show coming out of amazon i expected something a lot worse instead its about as faithful an adaption ive seen in a long long time the casting is perfect and reacher is exactly as how i remember him from the book
4,very good western tv series acting on point and good main cast
4,just tried this dress on in the store and ordered a petite because im if you are even or taller i wouldnt recommend a petite fit unless you prefer the tunic length this dress and material has a flattering drape for those of us with trouble belly regions
4,i made these cookies for the first time today the flavor is excellent my cookies came out very flat though i think i will try them again and add just a little more flour
4,i also decied that coleslaw was the way to go unfortunately the vietnamese egg rolls my sisterin law taught me how to make use a rice thread noodle so thats what i thought this recipe was calling for pretty sure theyre not the same still it has great flavor but i am also thinking maybe a side of fried wonton would make it a star
4,soft fabric great color for fall and sophisticated detail at waist sleeves a keeper
4,i liked this top a lot when i saw it at the store the cotton is soft and comfortable the colors are good i tried on the white charcoal and light aqua blue and the asymmetrical edge really makes it the subtle ruffle detail at the edge combined with the pieced asymmetrical hem takes it from a classic tee to a contemporary style however my store doesnt have petite sizes and the regular size hit me at a point in the hip that wasnt superflattering on me at it imay be an excelle
4,i ordered the p after trying on the regular and that was better it runs wide the lining is true to size but the overlay is loose the colors are pretty the design is nice but i didnt love it as much as other ones likes the studs add an edgier look to a almost dainty look flow y sheer fabric the cut is flattering if you get the right size recommend one size down no big dislikeswhy i would still recommend lbs dd chest in waist p
4,very flattering dress but i think the black is more of a washed out navyblack instead of a true black which made matching this with other black times cardigan tightsetc difficult
4,received this yesterday wearing it today and am happy its warm and cozy perfect blend of sweatshirt and sweater for when you want to be comfortable yet still look like you tried im quot and lbs i ordered an xs and its still pretty roomy which is how i think its supposed to fit i would prefer it to be a little more form fitting but not enough to send back great with skinny jeans and boots
4,its ok and value for money and no problem will come during small office work its good for normal work
4,i tried the black cat pattern in the store and it was cute but the sleeves tend to run quite slim while the bodice is loose so be aware you may want to size up if you ever have issues with tight sleeves
4,gud product
4,best product under budget
4,practically the same recipe as ours i wonder why she put in extra flour and sugar we dont also i use eggs
4,laptop is good but finger print system is not available and working good
4,do not buy this if speed is an issue you want type at least for speed but this type works great in my phone to just increase storage i keep all my pictures on it and random files i have not used it for music but imagine that since it plays my videos included with my pictures that it could easily handle music
4,i have made this and easy meatloaf several times for this recipe we really like the ketchup mixture topping
4,ive just been shatteredthis is some amazing story telling
4,pretty good i think it needs a little more seasoning like sp but overall it is a very tasty recipe and one i will make again i think buckeys suggestion to brown chops remove and make gravy in the same pan is a good suggestion all the flavor is in the bottom of the pan mine were done in less than an hour
4,the pattern and color of this top are beautiful when i saw the pattern i knew i had to have it the fit is a bit strange short which is fine for me as i am petite and boxy i bought it on sale and think its good value for the price its a good late summerearly fall piece
4,this was a nice dress but it wasnt quite was i was looking for the cut made me look too hippy maybe for someone that has no hips at all
4,nice product with best price
4,ordered this online and thought it was more of a red than the true orange that it is
4,easy and tasty
4,i was really suprised when i received this top it was a knit more like a tshirt material which i really like this way you can wear casual as well as dressing it up it is not see thru at all and it stay off the shoulder the one thing i dont like is the elastic band at top is too wide but overall ita s keeper
4,used this recipe for the first time for a christmas party this year i knew there was going to be a crowd so i doubled the recipeit made a huge amount the baked spaghetti was the hit of the party we didnt bring one bit home did increase the amount of cheese i mixed the cheese into the spaghetti before putting it in the baking dish really spread the cheesy around nicely love love love this recipe the family has been begging me to make it again already
4,i agree with the review that says this is better in person than in the pic online great sale price and super cozy but thin enough to transition to spring
4,good card at a good price but i bought it specifically for my gopro camera even though its a class its not fast enough to record on the higher quality settings i guess not all class are the same even among the exact same cards you will need to buy the extreme version for gopro
4,great material creative design luckily i am smallbusted and will be able to get away with nothing underneath the closureknotting on back is innovative a sexy jumper
4,these culottes are fun i bought the neutral color with the black stripes in xs in my opinion they run big i am usually a small waist hips pleats at the hip and low waist area are not always my friend but with a longer tank or shirt they looked fine the fabric moves in a graceful way and these culottes can be dressed up or down so far wrinkling isnt a huge problem but well see i am tall and these fall about the same place on the modelmid calf they looked grea
4,these pants are really pretty and comfrotable and i took a cahnce ordering them with a inch inseam i thought perhaps they would work with a inch heelhoweverm it is not the case tey much be much longer than inches due to the cut out i will not be able to have htem hemmed so htey must go back if you are taller i recommend they are truly flattering
4,this went together super easily and was very good i think maybe i would use a bit more spaghetti sauce or maybe i used a few too many raviolis i did not use the basil i will make this again for sure
4,as far as tshirts go this one is fun i love the lace up detail in the back the xs regular fit nicely lbs dd the shirt flares out swing so it can be a little much on the smaller gals but it was ok enough on me that the stylist decided to try it on too the orange color was pretty but i decided to pass as i have a lot of orange tops and that is the color that was most flattering on my skin amterial is on the thinner side and a little tiny sheer must be the trend
4,tasted great next time i may add sweet corn
4,this works with my galaxy s and is fast enough to record p video i would purchase again i have always had good luck with sandisk cards
4,not worth watching if youre used to high quality direction and cinematography whatever happened to lani what happened to the german guests staying at the pineapple suite
4,was hoping i was going to love this top and i did its a fun piece to dress up or down
4,wonderful product at this price just need bit of playstore updating and should come with inbuilt antivirus
4,good performance value for money
4,theres still the nerdy stuff on the side and i guess its amazingly accurate however theres a rebel movement being born here the looks are different it is not the everyday action style we are so much fed up with these days its rusty gloomy even quiet the pace gets at you but fortunately is a meaningful pace and details matter every detail has its own details theres depth in this thing even the main character hispanic facing an empire even that rings a bell if you cant see the three of them altogether still give it a try later if you still dont like it beyond ep guess thats it for you
4,purchased this for my galaxy s phone the phone has gb internal memory and you cant use this with it luckily it came with an adapter and i use it in my card reader for storage i go from the pc to the phone its worth the money but remember its useless with the galaxy s
4,this looked more fitted on the model the xs was still boxy on me but i loved the eyelet hem so much i kept it
4,considering the price the laptop gives more than we spent on it overall everything is good in this laptop
4,mike white is a good storyteller and always has good characters this season was no different except for the situations he put them in it was much darker than the past two seasons and some of the scenes are uncomfortable but thats probably what he was going for and if so it worked walter goggins was good but the scene stealer in this one is parker posey she was great as the mother of a dysfunctional family is an award in her future i think so they bring back some characters from the past and seamlessly bring them into the storyline the setting in thailand is great and the camera work around scenes creates a cool vibe definitely not for the faint of heart but worth watching
4,i just got a pair of these in petite and really like them i am short though so even the petite length is too long for me i wish it was the height of the cuff shorter than it is so i end up folding the cuff up it still looks cute though the stitching details are nice and quality seems good hoping they hold up the fabric seems durable if not a little too thick for hot summer weather but great for indoor ac office temperatures i am not going to buy another pair at full price but would c
4,shelby got some diffrent swag this is one of great series ive been watching
4,i couldnt recommend this series enough absolutely brilliant the animation is impeccable and the acting is superb the second series is some of the best television i have ever seen each episode gets better and better its gripping funny and all round amazing
4,i think this shawl is much more stunning on than on the hanger i think it will be a great piece to transition into fall wearing it over a black or white tee it can be dressed up or down especially for the sale price a great piece
4,after a long research about the sd cards i came across this deal i wanted an sd card for my new samsung note none of the review was talking about note most of the reviews were either about note or sa few reviews were talking about possible problem of not able to recognize the card and getting into the cycle where you have to call sandisk i was not sure to go for it or not although choices were very thin samsung cards were way out of my budgetso i decided to take a chance and i am happy that i didits working smoothly no need to format just works great one star for not exactly gb it shows up gbi will again update this post after month when i will really sure it has no problem
4,this vest is so cute and a perfect transition piece for fall it runs a little big i normally wear an xs but i had to exchange for an xxs
4,what on earth whats it all about wheres the fun and funny theres simply no point to this do not watch however to each his own i guess stars for coolidge even she wasnt funny
4,product is awesome i will change my review after using week
4,it is good for day to day task but low battery life hours
4,im writing this review after one week usage design and build quality is good and looks wise awesome but performance wise a little bit slow but compared to cost it was good the main flaw was charger quality was poor and it was watt it takes nearly to get charging full and with full charge we can use upto hours comparing to other new laptops it was average battery capacity camera quality is poor it was another flaw finally it was worth it for student purpose it was than enough
4,ive read the lee child books since their inception love the books many programsfilms made rarely stick to the books plot this is the exception i can feel the books come alive in this the best watch in forever if you love the books watch this
4,i saw this shirt in store a while ago but could not believe the price and was not about to spend my money on it however when it went on sale and there was an extra i decided to get it i like the top its cute and fun however it does poof out a little in the midline this top goes great with jeans or shorts and it is cute but definitely not worth full price for this
4,this dress fits true to size i ordered an xs like i usually wear as a small was falling off of me when i had tried on in store the colors are more vibrant in person its a really pretty dress and is very well made the fabric is solid and light weight i dont think it would work for someone with a lot of curves unless they sized up though as it is a really straight dress that is meant to lay free
4,this sweater looks way better in person than in this picture the secret try the petite size loses a star for not having seamed edges so it might fray or unravel easily but of course that clean unseamed cut looks super cute especially around the neck also a bit spendy but let me say again super cute on
4,this laptop is very useful for students for coading also others works is very smooth performance
4,this sweater is super lightweight and is very cute
4,beautiful shirt i recently purchased this on sale and it has been marked down even further so definitely buy it it is very pretty with the gold interwoven in the material the peplum is also not overwhelming it looks great with a pair of jeans and heels my husband immediately commented on this shirt and he does not notice anything
4,i got the tan one my friend got the same skirt shes tiny im not i have hips we both got a size and it fit us both it just sits higher on my waist than it does on hers above my navel not above hers i do have a small waist the skirt has a lot of movement but isnt poofy it is not seethrough it has that retailer charm where it looks pretty basic but is really flattering and charming a new wardrobe staple can dress it up or down only problem is the zipper in the back
4,this shirt is very pretty in person although more orange than it appears in picture i got it for off the sale price which was definitely worth it but i wouldnt have paid more than that the back has a soft tshirt jersey material with a gray and white print the neckline is a little weird gathers kind of strangely but other than that a really pretty top
4,the show is very entertaining was well written has a great pace and the directing was on point tim burton did not disappoint in this the only critique is on the casting of the rest of the addams family and from old fans gomez was a bigger charmer morticia had a more notable aurawas controlling of the room and pugsley had a bigger and naughtier personality they fall a bit flat note that they werent terrible there was just something missing that they did not bring to the table that aside the season was throroughly entertaining and hope this is the beginning of a large and successful franchise reboot
4,ok so much stuff in this show is way way over the top its more of a hollywood slicker view of a cowboy life rather than reality granted its a story and bound to be overblown but they go way way too far no wranglers do not regularly commit cold blooded murder no they do not sit at a table in a bull ring waiting to get gored no they do not get into fist fights all the time and so many more ridiculous things they have in this show having said all that its still entertaining so many of the characters although over the top are entertaining to an extent they are the id and people would like to be like them to an extent the plot is fairly complex and the intrigue and conflict is interesting the scenery is beautiful it gets addictive
4,these jeans are very comfortable with a higher waist than average jeans the material is soft and seems to be quality the are also stretchy which makes wearing them for long amounts of time very comfortable i ordered a size and they fit great i normally wear a
4,ive been making this soup since the early s of course its better with bacon my husband likes to top his with a dollop of sour cream
4,i was excited to see this dress as id bought the sparrow boiled wool sheath dress in xs last year and loved the fit however this dress does not fit the same way the top fits fine but the waist and the bottom are way too big i laid it over my sparrow dress from last year and the bottom is at least an inch wider two inches if you go by the total circumference im planning to exchange for an xxs and see if that one fits better
4,one of the finest laptop under for student one of the major con is its display otherwise on the basis of performance it is more than enough for post graduate
4,this dress is beautiful however it should be noted that there is a gold threading detail throughout the dress which is not pictured the dress appears to be a solid cream print in the pics but in person it has gold and cream i sized up bc i didnt want it to be too fitted im between a snd so i went w medium it fits will but slightly big id say tts though
4,i tried the simple hydrating cleansing wipes during the evening to remove my makeup and cleanoses the skin i found the wipes very soft and easy to use the wipes are nothe too wet or rough with just enough product on them to remove stubborn make up and feel gentle at the same time ideal for when you need tone take off makeup in a hurry and handy for traveling i would recommend for anyone that has sensitive or dry skin this review was collected as part of a promotion
4,wow i wish this would have worked for me the pom details are truly adorable and give the sweater that extra added touch i agree with the other reviewer that the crop style is almost too much and gives an awkward fit i am short so it cut me off in the wrong area i bought a petite xs the material is delicate but that is part of the charm so i didnt have a problem with that at al my problem was the fit a bit too boxy for my build wish it would have worked but ill have to admire
4,okok
4,absolutely adored every minute of it its got that trademark tim burton look which is great because i think hes the perfect choice to direct a film about wednesday addams and her family and its impossible to overlook danny elfmans score whenever he and tim collaborate the results are nothing short of perfect however perhaps because tim only directed the first four episodes i found the shows style and tone to be inconsistent throughout the rest of the eight episodes the show did a good job with the character arcs albeit there were some unnecessary elements such as the uncles minor role i thought the acting was good but not really outstanding overall though it was entertaining to me
4,adam families back the best series recommended to whatch this series and wednesday is a good series starting in episode is the best and other episodes is slowly down but you love it this series is best i love this series and wednesday character is best character i love it and most favourite character is name think and think lovely character and adam family is old show old movie is good but this series is best and i have no word but required word so i dont know i cant say spoiler but you was this series you watch this series you watch this series wednesday wednesday wednesday wednesday
4,overall goodi got k using card performance display battery value for money if under k recommended for codingautocad gaming heating issue some games like velorant its temperature is but after few min its temp is decreasing and normal use there is no heating problem overall cooling is good
4,i used gluten free all purpose flour to make it gluten free for my son also used milk velveeta it was delicious very thick and filling
4,overall ok but little bit slow like hdd
4,the other reviews stated this was a shapeless top but i sized down and it is very flattering and cute the green is a bright gorgeous jewel tone it has an overall flowy bohemian look to itthe bell sleeves add just the right touch of boho overall i am very pleased with this top it will be a great transitional piece into fall
4,i took a risk on this one i wasnt sure if the shirt was more green or more blue i look better in blue it turns out that the shirt is a bit more green but i think it still looks good im and lbs i got a medium i could have maybe gotten a small but i like the medium the shirt has a bit of a vintage look to it which i like all in all good
4,absolutely in love with this shirt the neckline is extremely flattering and the shirt naturally comes away from the body
4,i have only watched one episode but in terms of filmaking this is sheer genius one of the best adaptations ever and one of the best tv shows ever hbo simply do not disappoint pedro pascal is wonderfully cast as the lead protagonist in a post apocalyptic dystopia urban wasteland the first episode contains a lot of surprises and plot twists pascals character struggles to come to grips with loss and the new framework of society after a zombie apocalypse rips thru the heart of america he meets a young girl who may hold the key to humans salvation in terms of runtime fantastic value the pilot is well over an hour long may it continue
4,i had no expectations on this show was i ever blown away ive never been a big addams family fan but this show was fantastic i hope they do a second season i can hardly wait for it tim burton i am a fan of as i like most of his worknightmare before christmas edward scissor hands corpse brideto name a few all excellent filmsso when i saw he produced this i had to check it out i was not disappointed in the slightest if you are a tim burton fan addams family fan or both then this is a must watch you will not regret it the second season if renewed can not come soon enough
4,very good indeed except episode was happy kiddie disney crap most episodes are very good with some dialogue repetitive action sequences are mostly good some few are overlong the best choice made in production was to cast the mandalorian with a voice like clint eastwood
4,my five kids absolutely loved this twist on potato soup
4,this top is much nicer than expectedthe fabric and style are great i am a size small or medium and got the small from the front it was great not so much from the back for me im larger on top than bottom and the spandex made it too clingy around the dreaded bra fat area i dont wear spanx i wish retailer would be more specific with the fabric content if id known it was spandex i would have ordered a size medium i am thinking about doing this because the top is really
4,you know i tried to get into this series i tried several times it is enticing the cast the acting the cinematography but it just didnt seem to have any real direction or story odd
4,ok i am only two episodes in so not fair for final analysis but i am not impressed so far do people not watch old movies there are tons of movies with plenty of violence and conflict if thats your thing that are far far better hell on the waterfront is a good place to start watch that and then come back and compare there was no real scene setting for the three groups communist trade unionists thugs ira and yes usually historical movies make me go and research the real story but this was so light in telling the history that i wasnt interested at all this is cartoonish especially the way they make the main character so strong without any development and a fake sort of nuance they throw in a drug addiction as his secret weakness i guess oh and he really cares any time they make a main character so one sided i tune out as much as i like sam neill his character wasnt much better i hope it gets better
4,this is a multipack of eight bottles of fabric softener they are not the typical large sized bottles that i am used to which is a bonus as they are cumbersome and tricky to store these are half the height and fit better in the storage area in my kitchen the softener itself has a strong but not overpowering floral smell clothes come out of the wash noticeably softer after use when compared without any as i line dry my washing this has been a nice addition to my laundry routine
4,i loved the beautiful print the sleeves were beautiful as well and added a unique quality to the shirt i also liked the longer length of the shirt i ordered online and kept it
4,this body wash makes my skin so soft after using i wish it had more of a scent to it though
4,this is a large and tasty pie i added a little cinnamon and will try other fruits and berries when i make it again
4,definitely value for money product
4,nice for trading
4,everything is top notch except battery which drains very fast
4,this series is an absolute must watch it hooked me in after the first episode i had no idea how they were going to pull off another series seeing as the first one ended where the book ends think they have done a fab job with keeping the story intriguing interesting and still has its surprises the one and only negative thing is that there are way too many lingering shots on elisabeth moss i get that theyre trying to keep the tension and give us a sense of her emotions but its just too obvious and much sometimes seriously good other than that in my top tv series ever
4,unique and very tasty
4,design is awesome display good sound awesome performance nice
4,why so much hatred from professional critics this series impresses from the very first minute atmosphere dialogues fight scenes i feel like im reading a witcher book i am tired of these comparisons with game of thrones this is not a game of thrones this is witcher and its good
4,this is a fairly high quality tank which i purchased in bluegreen its narrower at the top more voluminous at the bottom and a heavier knit than i expected so im a little concerned about stretching over time but ill be careful washing it and enjoy it till that day does or doesnt come
4,this piece is almost what i want i tried on the white version in an xs and it felt a little too large for me even though its meant to be a looser fit the buttercup yellow behind the lace is very pretty i especially love that part of this tank it provides a nice contrast and allows the detail to stand out the navy is also nice it was on display next to the white and looks better in person than online what i didnt like was the texture of the spandex on the back portion it looks like
4,beautiful print agree with other reviewers that the small snap at the bust is inadequate for anyone with a d or greater bust size the dress was a perfect length on me with heels even after i kicked off my heels i didnt find it too long like other reviewers wind does open op the front so i may get it altered so its no longer a true wrap dress
4,fabulous
4,this works on my phone and is amazing however it seems to transfer pretty slowly i move a lot of music and movies on and off my phone so it can be annoying im not sure if my phone or this card is the weak link though i have note anyways it was cheap and it works that is all that matters buy it
4,i paired this top with pants and cardi from retailer and have really enjoyed wearing this outfit i usually wear a large but due to how much material there is and how flowy it is i sized down to a m and it fits perfectly only down side is getting the buttons buttoned behind your neck
4,i love this recipe however to make it gluten free i do not add the milk butter or flour instead i just leave a couple of large pieces of cauliflower then when it is done i remove the large pieces and put them in the blender then add it back to the soup voila cream soup without the gluten i do add some salt and garlic as well i think it is delicious
4,hbos the white lotus from the singular mind of mike white has rapidly become a cornerstone of modern prestige television known for its incisive social commentary wrapped in the luxuriousyetsuffocating atmosphere of exclusive resorts the anthology series invites comparison between its distinct seasons each installment offers a unique flavour but tracing the series path reveals a fascinating evolution arguably reaching its zenith with the latest offering the first season arriving like a breath of fresh tropicalscented yet subtly toxic air from hawaii was nothing short of phenomenal it wasnt just a vacation drama it was a masterclass in building tension exposing the rot beneath the glossy veneer of wealth and privilege the intricate character work the biting satire aimed at guests and the system they inhabit and the steadily escalating sense of dread combined to create something truly special season set an incredibly high bar immediately establishing the white lotus as essential viewing transitioning to the sundrenched dramatic landscapes of sicily season offered a different though still potent vintage it delved deeper into themes of sexual politics infidelity and the complex often transactional nature of relationships the italian setting provided a stunning backdrop for another intricate web of desire and deceit while undeniably compelling maintaining the shows signature suspense and visual flair season perhaps felt like a slight shift in focus rather than a direct escalation from the groundbreaking impact of the first remaining highquality television but not quite recapturing that initial shock of brilliance for all viewers however any discussion of the series must now center on the sheer triumph that is season set presumably against the rich cultural tapestry of thailand this season is an absolute masterpiece arguably the series crowning achievement its power lies significantly in a meticulously paced slowburning narrative that draws viewers in from the very first moments and refuses to let go rather than relying on immediate fireworks the story allows tension to coil secrets to fester and character complexities to deepen with extraordinary patience this approach creates a deeply immersive almost unbearably suspenseful experience that feels earned and incredibly rewarding it explores its themes perhaps spirituality versus commodification the nuances of cultural encounters or existential unease with depth and precision this isnt just another great season it stands as one of the most compelling expertly crafted seasons of television in recent memory a definitive in conclusion while each iteration of the white lotus offers its own rewards the journey through the series highlights a remarkable consistency combined with a willingness to evolve season was groundbreaking season compellingly explored new territory but season perfects the formula with its masterful slowburn approach it solidifies the white lotus not just as a great show but as a landmark of contemporary television touché
4,i saw this top in my local store and almost didnt try it on solely because i hate splitsleevecoldshoulder tops but the peplum style and pattern were so cute that i took it into the dressing room anyway after trying on probably items i wound up buying this top and one other i really like the fit as i am highwaisted and it defines my waist really well the wide neck is also super flattering and i love the pattern i went ahead and purchased despite the fact that i wasnt thrille
4,really good everyone loved it i also put fresh garlic in it
4,very happy with the fit of this sweater which is flattering and unique the ruffle elevates the piece very soft and a good length for me i got a medium in both the sleeves and the body the hole at the neck gaps a little which may bug me as time goes on but otherwise i am so pleased with this sweater that i am willing to put up with it i ordered this in the red which is more of an orangey red which does not suit my skin tone i will exchange for the bluegray version
4,pretty good i didnt add any brown sugar or onions because i didnt have any and i had to use bread crumbs instead of oats but it was still great
4,i ordered a p in this dress so it wld fall above my knees be slightly smaller than a regular sometimes a regular size works sometimes a typically a regular size is big on me i am c just recd the p in the mail the first thing i noticed is that its s a knit fabric that looks feels like polyester although says cotton on the inside label i think it wld be a bit warm in hot weather but that is just my observation the main problem is that it is too big on each s
4,the initial two seasons were passable with some promise however the third season proves to be a complete squandering of time it fails to evoke any genuine emotions not even passion between yennefer and geralt the plot twists are lame failing to provide any unsuspecting turns that would keep viewers on the edge of their seats the script itself is poorly constructed devoid of creativity and imagination without prior knowledge of the books story this adaptation becomes nearly unwatchable the overwhelming abundance of bewildering names territories kingdoms and characters only adds to the confusion is this the new direction entertainment is taking i sincerely hope this is not a prevailing trend what we truly yearn for is the immersion effect eagerly awaiting the next episode and being wholly captivated by the unfolding narrative we long for the days of game of thrones first six seasons where every episode was a gripping masterpiece i have added an additional stars solely for the exceptional talent of the actors they are truly outstanding however even their brilliant performances could not overshadow the pervasive flaws of the plot
4,lets start off with the timelinewho decided it would be a good idea to have different stories occurring at different time periods this makes the show feel disconnected and slightly confusing each story arc felt like its own story and didnt quite connect as it should henry cavill did what he could with the acting but the emotionless aspect of the witcher made his acting come across as cheesy the acting of yennifer felt stronger in the beginning as opposed to her eventual transformation the special effects were alright in some scenes and not so great in others the gratuitous nudity should have been replaced with more of a focus on action scenes and building geralts character geralt should be much stronger than he seemed as he kept putting himself in vicarious positions which made him seem weaker than he should be i did notice and appreciate effort to give some shine to people of color on the show since the world is usually mostly white this is not enough to get me to care about the show and it fell short by boring me more than keeping me interested ill go back to playing witcher iii which ive enjoyed way more than any episode of the show and might cautiously watch season whenever it does come out
4,i like how this dress is really different and fun with the slit up the front and the short layer revealed underneath it can be worn in many seasons i wore it yesterday with sandals but i could also see wearing it with booties and a cardigan cute dress
4,every thing is excellent bugget friendly product but right click refresh window frequency is some time low
4,love love love this top it is everything i hoped it would be i liked that it could be worn up or off the shoulder what made me fall in love were the colors quality is excellent as usual it is quite full in bodice however its only an xs i do best with xxs tops
4,the great thing about a swing dress is that it doesnt cling to the curves this one is the same way i got the geometric print the colors are fun i would have gone down to the small just to loose some of the material on this dress if it had not fit across so tight across the back if you have no bust i would say size down two sizes or try a petite the dress has a breathable fabric so great for summer wear the only cons are the large armpits and extra fabric but sizing down should help
4,overall product is good one drawback battery drain fast
4,hi all i bought this laptop performance as per price performance is ok but not ok for heavy users as it starts lagging design design is good but build quality is ok ok display as per price good value for money yes it is battery hours
4,basic ribbed white tank with a little character in the back could easily be dressed up or down material is soft and light and has a slight stretch i will be getting a lot of use out of this piece
4,i have several devices that use micro cards so i buy these in anticipation of needs in the future so i am not going to test this to see if it works when i get this most items i buy at a good price now if i am loading up cameras and recording gear for a trip or maybe a day at le mans i will check them before i travel as i check batteries and spares and chargersso far i have not had a problem with sandisk i am gearing up for a trip my destination is a bit in question at this point
4,this was very good but does take a bit of time and dishes to prepare i added cup queso fresco cheese and we like that a lot i am thrilled to know how to make a great red sauce
4,but kevin life imitates life but kabull is a pacific city compared to the ranch and montana oh so though people may you know that the lead characters are interesting the plot exaggerated and feels artificial for a connoisseur or a guy from mogadishu in favor of the series it is pro level defenitly and locations are dreams about america environmental issues are truths savage horses are hard to tame so you passed by the high probability of being a lame cliché it is beautiful actors good but as a script please admit direction must bring it to an art plane of existence or it will became rambo montana type
4,i very rarely watch any casted tv id much rather watch content that promotes introspection altruism new prospective knowledge and maturity but i must say this show is a masterpiece it shows how truly damaged human beings really are how maniacal and selfish willing to go to any links to gratify themselves or gained position never revealing their real motives even to there friends children and spouses how truly immature we are having no self knowledge thinking we know everything lying about everything scared to death of everything i think its a true self portrait of how most really are even if they never show it to the extent that the show did well you ever truly know somebody will someone ever take the time to be introspective enough to know themselves will you ever be able to trust somebody is transparency and selflessness a myth romanticize but never realized all questions the show post in a masterful way its been years since ive watched a casting shower but this show truly polarized and captivated my mind allowed me to ponder upon myself and my fellow man i actually gained from watching a show something a show like this has never allowed me to do or even intrigue me enough to try i can only hope that as we roll into this st century we move away from such immaturities and selfishness start to value introspection and altruism and grow into our rightful place of maturity and selflessness to be a happy and peaceful family as a species bravo
4,i usually find maeve to run tts but i sized down in this i am normally a p and got an xs regular to make the length more workappropriate i think a larger size emphasized the extra room at the front tucks making it look a little maternitylike it is very flattering on drapes nicely i got the cranberry color for the holidays and will wear in with wine tights and light taupe over the knee suede boots
4,very versatile skirt thats suitable for any occasion or any season
4,i ordered the rednavy and i love that its a true red and navy the subtle ribbing adds the right amount of texture i normally order size small but i felt the top was a little big and has a very long hem line im hoping it shrinks in the wash and i might alter the hem if its still too long after washing
4,this dress is very figure flattering however it is not navy its purple overall nice print somewhat cheap material and zipper gets stuck i am keeping because its versatile and i like the vintage floral pattern
4,this is a good skirt although i think the fabric keeps it from being great it fits well has a good shape and drapes nicely the synthetic material is ok and ill keep it but it may limit the use ill wear it to work but probably not to nicer events
4,as in the other review this dress runs small im usually an but it was tight and short i would love to exchange for a but its out of stock the beading and the colors on this dress are breathtakingi was so disappointed it didnt fit the background is more taupenude than cream which i actually really like
4,one of the best product of lenovo apart from battery life everything else is perfect looks good as compared to dell or hp laptops performs really well
4,very cute summer dress it runs a bit large and it doesnt give you shape but its good for me to hide my belly fat the dress is so comfortable to wear i didnt know that it has pockets so that was a pleasant surprise i always love pockets overall its a perfect summer dress
4,having grown up with the original addams family series i thought id watch this to my surprise it was a bit better than expected overall the acting was quite good throughout the series jenna ortega did a super job with her performance of wednesday i didnt care for some of the casting choices but for the most part cast choices were good despite the attempts at twists and turns i found the series quite predictable in general the series was well written with plenty of sarcastic with isms there was a bit too much teen drama for my liking keeping me from rating the series higher hopefully future seasons wont water down wednesday any further than they already have it is an entertaining series worth the watch
4,nice laptop value for money a little slow still okay for basic needs thankyou flipkart
4,its a cute top i agree with the other poster that the neck in the front feels a little restrictive
4,seriously cant stop thinking about this show i felt so connected and excited to turn it on exerted i opened by computer im a lover of characterization and these characters man they are well written and thought out also there is a perfect mix of genres keeping you on your toes plus not one bad actor makes for the characters believability i got attached to each story within the show with each and every character and it kept me watching and sad when the season ended cant wait for season plus the guy who wrote it is schneebly from school of rock ill definitely be checking out everything else he doesdid
4,product is good but worst delivery experience from flipkart
4,and it is excellent it stays away from making calls on the political issues it tackles and leaves the audience to decide just thrilling and brilliant kelly as beth and cole as rip are superb
4,the pattern camouflages my curvy figure the fabric is very soft great for lounging i wish the fabric offered a little more support though for working out
4,i am typically a and the dress is true to size xl i live that the embroidery runs the full length of the dress i also like the shimmery side seam detail the front cut near the shoulders is very flattering on one minor issue is a gap in the bosom area due to button placement however i plan to add a snap t i fix i often have this issue as i am large in that area the length is flattering as well and provides great coverage in the rear lightweight and flows nicely the color is wond
4,this sweater is really pretty it is a little itchy but seems really well made i also like that you have the option of wearing it open with the tie tied in the back for some shape a nice alternative to the basic cardigan
4,this shirt feels amazing it is the perfect length for leggings i have it in long sleeves also i dont love the pink color i bought it looks very different from the color pictured
4,overall good laptop at reasonable price for light work i am using it since last one year pros good battery life from hrs to hrs depending upon work intensity good processor ok kind of build quality cons below average display ok for text reading but not for viewing video speaker is not loud enough remember to inspect properly before takin delivery as some back panel screw was missing in my unit
4,perfect casting great writing acting and the perfect amount of action and intrigue they also manage to keep the essence of the books with some tweaks amazon have definitely knocked it out of the park with this one i like that they made it weekly so i cant binge it all in a day and have to wait but also the weekly wait is tough the different storylines each season keep it fresh and the new characters keep it interesting im super excited to see more books made into seasons my favourite so far being die trying heres hoping the show is popular and renewed for a good while to come
4,very good item smooth function
4,this is a very pretty dress with a unique bodice and neckline however it seems to run small on top i can not zip up the top by myself zipper is in the back even though i usually wear a size or xs in this brand im a d so im narrow on top i havent decided yet if im keeping it because despite the sizing issue the dress is lovely
4,the color is a very dark mustard yellow thinlightweight material and it has a pretty feminine drape verall a nice twist on a classic plaid shirt cute cuffs complementary design the top was baggier than the bottom though i deducted a star for the tight fight on the hips all photos show it unbuttoned or tucked in im usually between a sm i recommend the size up for hip fit
4,this turned out well
4,because the bottles are smaller and lighter and i have a touch of stiffness in my hands i find these much easier to pick up and pour them than the traditional larger bottles although i did have a bit of a struggle getting the lid off the first time the scent is fresh floral and pleasant and not overpowering and it lingers on washing well afterwards too the bottles are reasonably good value as a little goes a long way a half capful is recommended for washes of kg and a full capful for larger washes there are washes based on the half capful dose for kg loads so as i usually do larger loads i should get approximately washes per bottle the bottle is made from recycled plastic and it can be recycled again except for the plastic sleeve
4,i cut in squares and took to a potluck it was a hit my changes were i used ground turkey and pork sausage had eggplant in garden so grated in with zucchini will make again
4,purchased a week ago have used it about times and after second application i already had a nice subtle tan didnt expect it to work so quick would say get some disposable gloves as even washing hands straight away did notice odd markings on hands
4,its good as it is
4,value for money but battery low hars display
4,i love this pullover i felt it was a little wide at the bottom but i received lots of compliments on it i ordered a large because i did not want it tight around the bust i wear a j bra and biceps but i think i would have been fine in a medium
4,as previous reviews have stated this blouse is see through but it is amazing very rich quality and can be dressed up or dressed down it is well worth the price now that it is on sale
4,the laptop is good but it generates a lot of hot air near the display during gaming i am worried for the display
4,please note that this laptop is for extremely basic usage like youtube basic word processing using google docs etc if thats what you need then this laptop is for you its best feature is its battery life which can easily stretch to nearly hours plus it also has android apps but the implementation is kind of awkward and uneven
4,i have made this salad many times everyone really likes it we dont like miracle whip so i use mayonnaise very good
4,overall laptop is at a price of
4,such a cute top can be dressed up or down i wore it on sting break and had many compliments
4,i agree with the other reviewer the photos do not do this shirt justice its very cute and fits well the photos on the models are terrible im tall lbs and d and the size medium fit me perfectly im often in between a m and l for cloth and stone but the medium fit well which means it runs a little big i wanted a plain white shirt with a little interest and the side buttons add that it also means this is not a tuck in shirt but more of a tunic
4,based on reviews i was concerned that this dress would not fit in the chest area however i find that i have ample room there i am a full c it is a tiny bit tight in the waist but not uncomfortable or unflattering i will go ahead and say that it runs small for that reason the straps are a little long on me and will need to be taken up also there is no zipper so getting it on and off requires unbuttoning the buttons so its not fast overall quality is very nice and it is very prett
4,love these always get compliments im bought size small washed in warm line dried they are a bit shorter lengthen the straps drops the waist but at least gets them to my feet
4,thought it was really good simple action packed and great fight scenes main characters were more than solid good old fashion kick ass series hope they continue it
4,fancy and fun i love the green and the texture shiny outside and soft inside flattering fit and a little whimsical and dressy or casual
4,im a new fan to the star wars fandom i havent watched the films until last year and im so lucky that i did after i watched the mandalorian im so thankful that i considered watching the movies and becoming a fan because it brought me closer to the world and its characters and i cant wait to watch even more im so hyped
4,what a fabulous meal i used a smidge of smart balanceamish butter instead of canola over chicken thighs i didnt have lemon pepper so squeezed fresh lemon after rolling it to release the juices on both sides after browning then crisped the thick cut bacon this is actually easier if you use scissors and cut the bacon in pc cooks quicker alsoin a separate cast iron pan i carmelized small onions in butter and spooned some of the bacon greases into it as needed fresh sharp white cheddar worked for me as welli chopped romainebuttercrunch lettuces and rough cut a few craizines cranberry raisins wcoarse pepper alternating the various delectable pieces with lettuce was almost like wilted lettuce but betterbrava i am seriously impressed
4,its been month bought gb version a perfect laptop for a me as a developer less key travel with backlit keyboard ips display getting around hrs battery backup with vs code and browser overall good value for money performance pretty decent on light gaming and handling multi tasking smoothly like vs code running two browser side by side with lots of tab open also run another third party app overall running smoothly compiles code very fast it is a good product if you are not a hea read more
4,ive made this a few times and i always add diced tomatoes mushrooms and garlic and i substitute the ground beef with seasoned ground turkey i top it with more mozzarella and parmesan cheeses one jar of ragu is enough for mebut either way it always comes out good and beats standing over a stove for hours
4,the first season was good but it was a little bit boring and the rest is pretty bad
4,i purchased this product week back received it on time the first thing i would like to share is msi is not so user friendly unlike hplenovo so when i received the laptop i was facing an issue of battery drain and there were heating issues as well but then some updates and some tweaks here and there helped me solve the battery and heating issue the laptop is very powerful if it is used for office work or even for content watching it is very good in that segment though the sound qualit read more
4,yummy doesnt freeze well with the tortellini in it
4,performance and design are good but battery should have more backup
4,good show the last of us was indeed a great series after hearing many raves and good things from people that i know i finally decided to give it a chance like the game it is definitely worth your time well made compelling and great characters with real chemistry made this series a fun watch a slower build to some pretty intense scenes while it did have periods of time that it moved more slowly it certainly never felt boring pedro pascal as joe miller and bella ramsey as ellie williams made this a great show and the chemistry they develop feels natural and heart warming very good show
4,nice onego for it
4,bought as a gift for new family member otter seems to be a big hit and soon sends her to sleep
4,i had this in my wish list a long time ten when sale came along my size was sold out however someone returned it at my local store i purchased it then tried it on later why i ended returning it fabric was gorgeous and light but fall is coming and i wont wear it until next summer may get over it by then the shape is really nice but the hem hit me in a weird spot on my short muscular legs as others mentioned there are spots where the sewing is not perfect and bulges a little
4,this is a deliious breakfast casserole my entire family enjoyed it i am making it again this weekend while we are snowed in thank you for submiting it
4,great summer pantsnice material easy to take care of im and usually wear a size which i purchased the neutral they might be a little bit loose but they fit great and best of all they truly are slimming i love them so much that i just ordered the greenhard to top the sale price
4,i really loved the uniqueness of this dress and i was hoping to be able to wear it to work but it was just a little too fitted for the office
4,i just finished episode im loving this so much epic fantasy mythology a bit of time travel and im in heaven unlike most reviewers id never even heard of the witcher until i started watching this so im not comparing it to a book or a game im watching it as a complete newbie henry cavill is hot intriguing compelling and that voice gives me goosebumps aside from that the story is fabulous the casting is wonderful the atmosphere draws me in completely and the characters even the minor ones are welldrawn im captivated by several characters and cant wait to see how it all develops i havent seen an epic fantasy that draws me in like this in a very long time
4,good product in this price
4,this is one of my fav shows ever the story is incredible
4,i bought the pink which is a vibrant but not neon shade of deep reddish pink love it i love how the flutter of the sleeves is balanced with a slimmer fitting body which keeps it from looking frumpy i did order a size down to achieve this look i prefer a more tailored look so this suits me while satisfying my desire for a little whimsy now and then my only issue is that its too low cut trying to decide if i just need to wear it with a lowercut bra or if this requires a cami i hate laye
4,very good product and actually it is worth in price it is very helpful for students
4,in the photo i loved the colors in person though the print on mine had the four huge pink lily flowers on the front and it just wasnt the look i was hoping for like the photo also i failed to notice in the photo that theres elastic along the seam of the butt this seems silly and unnecessary its not terribly noticeable on but still i felt weird the fabric is thick and not seethru and the quality is fine but the combination for the shifted print and the unexpected ruching and thes
4,i gave it stars because my son really liked it but my daughter and i thought it was just okay
4,love peplums and love this top the quality and fabric is beautiful i did have to size up because it ran a little too short on me but otherwise great top really cute to pair with a statement necklace as well
4,the shirt fits nice and has a classic cut i would imagine this to look good on just about anyone the shirt is soft and comfortable but is rather thin and see through the stitching is coming undone a little bit in some areas wouldnt pay full price for it but its worth it on sale
4,this skirt fits great the thick material helps it lay nicely and smooth the curves im about lbs athletic build with a bottom and the med fit well
4,i love the versatility of this top i feel like i can wear it with anything to dress it up or down
4,i have no need for this dress but had to have it i read the reviews and when there was a sale weekend pulled the trigger on it just as reviewers noted its very flattering from the front and just as another reviewer noted the back torso is widely misshapen creating a hunchback look but i figured a good tailor could make it right its going to cost just under jacksons to do it which is about how much the discount was for the sale but i expect to have this dress for years and cant
4,beautiful suit i had been eyeing this one for weeks and finally decided to just buy the darn thing it is tiny just beware as in it doesnt cover much especially on the booty not a bad thing but buyer beware if you are looking for more coverage size up i wear a d and ordered a medium top good thing i didnt get a small i have to get the band taken in a bit but i need the coverage in the cup for the bottoms i also got a medium and usually wear a small or medium in swimwear bo
4,performance is outstanding for normal browsing and gaming display is average little whitish but greater than others hour battery backup and booting is very fast fps outstanding gaming everything is good compare to hp and dell at this price
4,i bought this top for my year old daughter and she thinks it is beautiful its very comfortable and good for days that are not too cold but not too warm lovely
4,is good laptop in rate
4,gud laptop in this range really has a quick booting
4,works great for the month i have had it in my galaxy s i purchased this to go in my samsung galaxy s and was super excited i didnt need to buck up more money for the gb phone well dumb me did not know the the sg does not allow apps to be moved to an external sd card i thouhgt i had researched everything but i missed that the card works fin and i can store umpteen thousand pictures not that i have figured out how and i might even be able to figure out how to put a movie onto it but what a waste of a great sd cardpro top of the line cardcon ssg and most new smartphones wont allow apps to sd even with the micro sd card option on the phone
4,i really enjoyed this show and cant wait for the next season each episode is exciting in its own way and baby yoda is the best the acting is really good and theres good action if u like any of the star wars movies tv shows or books u will like this show and its very family friendly
4,i actually made this with berry jello and whipped strawberry yougurt everyone that ate it loved it i cant wait to try this with another flavor
4,shelby brothers are just a treat to watch one of the best show i have ever watched
4,not only the best star wars series by far but one of the best adult television shows since the sopranos and breaking bad period an all time masterclass on acting directing writing and producing will be discussed for years to come a seamless transition that makes movies from year ago that much more powerful what television show has done that before a true mark of a quality product is complete buy in from the audience and acceptance of the characters as their own fans want more of their stories more of their character arcs no one wants this to end well done tony and thanks to whichever disney exec greenlighted this masterpiece
4,performance is decent as it has the latest chipset battery is performing pretty good now actual performance can be reviewed after sometime design is a lower part in this laptop as it can be improved as you are spending handsome amount and getting a fibre plastic body at bottom which looks cheap display is above average as it has a decent display and full eye protection overall value for money but the most disappointing things are one is plastic body at bottom and nd is worst audio spe read more
4,worth for price
4,great start to a cut back more story oriented show where cgi is a filler instead of a main stay however continuity needs to keep the blaster riffle on the same shoulder cmon its basics of story boarding plan the shot and path this is a fan series from continuous nods to previous episodes to filling gaps you missed by not watching cartoons all in all a very good effort at bringing light to a shadow of curiosity while fitting in with a cannon revision that keeps some of the book marks from earlier explanations
4,i bought this top in two colors because i need more statement tops and thought the colors were different enough for a really great top i have only worn the ivory so far and love it comfortable great style and solid quality so the fringe isnt fraying or falling out if i could change one thing it would be the itchiness around the neck opening its not horrible but it can be distracting and mildly uncomfortable i am really happy with the tops and cant wait to start wearing the black one t
4,super comfortable pant they dont feel or look like jeans but will hug your body like jeans i bought the regular size they waist is not tight and i needed to roll up the bottoms about inches i have not washed or dried these yet but i imagine they will wash well
4,white lotus is one of the best sharpest and most consistently funny satires ive ever seen it takes on the preening privileges of the moneyed class as they vacation at white lotus resorts so far weve seen the maui and italy hotels but no doubt they extend worldwide for more fun games with a different resort featured each season begins with the implication that a character has died and the episodes are a flashback to how it happened its hard to top the epic hilarity of the wildly dysfunctional mossbacher family from season not to mention with the ongoing battle between the fedup manager armond vs sean the toxic male karen season is somewhat less funny but has a more structured murdermystery the cast largely changes with each season but ive heard that a character from season will be back for season
4,the sweater is prettier in person than online great quality tight knit overall good purchase however it does run small i would absolutely size up i am a size with a c chest and i ordered a m and i would have been happy with a roomier l i was going to return to my local store but they were sold out in the larger sizes i will keep it because its gorgeous and ill make do with the less relaxed fit but it doesnt look on me like it does on the model
4,my favorite features of this sweater are the flattering neckline and the bracelet length sleeves its a heavyweight cotton with a beautiful line my only complaint is that it seems to pick up lint and things very easily and needed a lint roller even straight out of the delivery box still a small issue for an easy to wear sweater that looks great with jeans and boots as well as leggings a new favorite
4,battery drains faster than expected after all the discounts its value for money in this price segment
4,nice series but the fifth season is very disappointing
4,all good but battery not for value of money
4,cute black tshirt that runs absolutely huge i ordered the extra small because the extra extra small was sold out the extra small was not even close to fitting so disappointing very cute tshirt for very big people do not buy if your petite
4,this show is different well done and on a high level from start to finish easily one of the best shows of so far dont believe the bad reviewsthese people most likely just dont get ita three digit iq helps here the good thing is that this could go on for some seasons now they just need to add some more nice placesand of course a similar amount of mixed up interesting characters put them on a small island eg maledives a caribbean cruise african safari or even in some big citiesalso some more crossover stuff would be cool tanya or a reunion of characters from previous seasons can become quite a big thing
4,absolutely amazing i feel like im playing and watching star wars in same time
4,unfortunately i am not toned enough to truly show off this beautiful blouse armholes are cut in a bit too far for my year old arms was hoping for a pop of color as a basic sleeveless top to layer under sweaters and jackets for traveling but the neckline wasnt layering as i had hoped i am only but want a bit more length i think this blouse is best worn uncovered as shown on a toned body that does not require the longer length i prefer seems to be well made sadly i must return
4,i loved the mauve color i loved the idea of the heathered fabric and lace insets but the linen was rough and scratchy my regular size was boxy and a little too short size i ordered my normal size small for retailer brands im tall approx lbs d long torso fit i was swimming in size small the cut was boxy and unflattering on me very wide through the chest it kind of hung on me the length was a bit short for my liking if i were to size down i would b
4,great addition to my cold weather wardrobe comfortable and has the slouchy look but still nice enough to wear to work
4,good performance it has quad core processor and maximum threads in this budget backlight key board missing
4,i am up to date with the latest episodes i love this programme one thing i cant stand though is beth she is shocking there is no convincing me that she is done tough woman raised in a ranch still a great show but season by season she gets worse and more boring to watch caseys wife just cries all the time then the lady whom is the advisor to chief rainwater just sits and talks in a threatening but if you are watching the programme none threatening voice looks like shes constipated everytime shes on screen the end to season and the beginning to season are probably the most gripped iv been watching a tv show in a long time quality
4,i really liked the lace up details and embroidery the sleeves were too long for me and i was not a fan of the elastic on the sleevemade it tough to push sleeves up i took to my seamstress and her cut elastic out and hem the sleeve now its perfect
4,i tried on xs regular and xxs petite i would need xs petite lbs dd chest love the cut very cute and flattering the tie back is styling but this piece is very trendy and so i decided to pass as i am not sure how often i could wear it to work will wait to see if it goes on sale patter is very fun nice for the beach or casual brunch with the girls i do still like it
4,even the website had this card in the picture of what id be ordering when i got a plain black sandisk card i was a bit concernes and peeved sonsidering i bought the big one turns out android hate class cards and much more prefers class cards because of the way the os accesses lots of files at once and class timing is just better for their computations only the star off because of my own expectationsotherwise this is gonna make a great camera card hopefully the pics take faster its certainly a size upgrade atleast
4,cilian murphy is perfect in his character the direction is tremendous the director gives each character balanced screen space with the main character remain point of concentration the peaky blinders will impress you dont miss this masterpiece
4,got it for rs during bbd sale the laptop design is good and the back panel is very thin good for home use
4,these were really good simple and fast i served them with my new favorite rice viggo mexican rice
4,good product but average display in this price range
4,i hate ranking this recipe because i did not make this strictly according to the directions because i wanted to make it a bit healthier and i eliminated the meat however i have no doubt that had i used the flour and butter roux it would have made the soup even richer and tastier i was happy to find a cheese soup recipe that didnt use broccoli since one of my family members doesnt like it i did double the recipe and it was very good that being said heres what i did i put the onion celery and carrots and cup of broth in the soup pot and simmered for minutes i then added the potatoes the rest of the broth the basil and parsley and simmered for another minutes until the potatoes were done to thicken the soup i then mixed some chicken broth and cornstarch in a cup and added that to the brothveggies mix stirring constantly i heated the milk and velveeta in the microwave stirring occasionally until the cheese was mostly melted i added the cheesemilk mix after the potatoes were cooked i did not add any salt and i did not use the sour cream i ended up with a delicious soup that was a bit healthier and i served it in homemade bread bowls very very good
4,this dress is gorgeous flattering oood quality and in my opinion better than the erin fetherston dress because of the black rather than nude liner which really brought our the beautiful embroidery come on practically everything in rtw is a knockoff of something i do have to comment that the slip is quite snug though but at least its stretchy that being said it still had a bit of a tendency to creep up i was glad i had a black half slip on as well the fit is tts but a bit short wa
4,ive made this twice i think i used corn tortillas the first time and liked it better than with flour i used about cups of cheese instead of just cup and my family thought it needed more cheese next time i will use less cumin and will leave out the italian dressing someone mentioned layers of tortillas im pretty sure its just layers i placed tortilla in the middle and tore the others to make them fit i ended up only using tortillas
4,love the pattern the pants are really cute perfect for pajamas or casual outfit to go to a fiends house in they do have a funny seam above the knee but i still find them comfortable
4,henry cavill is geralt i love the books and games and boy oh boy it lived up to them all im so sorry so many people had a hard time following it its a puzzle and if you watch and if you listen its not hard to follow im not new to new to imbd this is a real review all us gamers cant be wrong its amazing
4,i love this recipe i made my own graham cracker crustbetter than store bought amp easy to throw together you can definitely pick out the gelatin flavor you like and match a yogurt to it for peach strawberry or any flavor you like most of the ingredients i had on hand
4,i am on the fence on this oneits quite beautiful as color goes the pic online seems rather faded i just felt it was a bit wider on the bottom than might be flattering otherwise beautifully made and the fabric is of great quality i just i wish some of these tops were in better proportion from top to bottom and less bulky other than that i still may purchase as the print is beautiful
4,i really like the appearance of this item and it looks pleasing with many different styles of leggings it does run a little large i am a true to size small and this hangs on me a little but i love the design of the back it is so soft and comfortable
4,good working
4,this review will be shorter as i already wrote another one and it was never posted these are high quality jeans the fabric weight is light enough you will be able to wear them yearround i am lbs and the size felt best on me for this brand i typically wear a i felt like the was cut too narrow in the hips for my body type for ref i am athletic with shoulders broader than hips if youre unfamiliar with this brand know they do not use a lot o
4,very good i did make a couple changes though i was worried about the brown sugar since i dont like meat to have any sweetness to it so i gradually added white sugar and decided t was enough i also added a t of garlic powder as for the rice i added a cup of uncooked instant rice toward the end of cooking time and it was still plenty soupy oh and i also added a small chopped onion when i browned the burger
4,this shirt has a great fit and a nice change from the swing style short in front and longer in back looks great with the higher waisted pants and traditional skinny nice details on buttons and trim
4,i was utterly enraptured by the first series because it so encapsulated what a holiday is wildly anxious and full of doubt and tension a brilliantly rich character piece fantastically woven with stunning performances all round but coolidges troubled mcquoid and daddarios conflicted journalist stood out for me particularly theres buckets of layered commentary on contemporary culture wealth and privilege although not every part felt vital and a few decisions however well intentioned made the production itself sometimes trip into the culture in which it is satirising however when white lotus hits its stride the tension is unbearable counterpointed with beautiful music and cinematography at the core of it though are the brilliantly observed characters who all went to make it one summer holiday ill never forget in fact were none of us allowed to forget it as it got a second series sharper tighter and even more tense the series is getting rightfully lavished with praise from all sides now which is very gratifying
4,got lots of complements on this one worn to work with skinny pants and a chunky necklace classic look with a twist would also look adorable with jeans as shown
4,nice but some time playing game you feel lag then you use charger with laptop and play no lag found
4,in my opinion the characters remained dislikable or to shallow to carry the story actually i waited the whole serie that it would get better or turn around as the plot and the reviews were quite promising the actors did a good job but so many interactions and dialoges were just to long over the top or cringe good potential but character building and development were done unsatisfactory not sure if it intended to be a satire but they didnt achieved that but i still watched it to the end to see how it ends so not totally bad watch it if you like nice hawaii pictures and music though
4,uncomfortable in the leg area but otherwise very flattering
4,working good display good battery perfect performance fast
4,as other reviewers have said this shirt runs a little short and wide i usually wear petite so the length didnt bother me the sleeves fit me perfectly which is rare in regular sizing so others may find that they are too short and tight to fix the boxiness issue i just stitched of the seams in the back together to give it more shape since i bought the black pattern my diy fix isnt too obvious but this may not work for the other colors it needed a little work but it was worth it fo
4,i am using it since one year nice product at this price range great performance slim and lightweight but battery issues which should be recovered
4,i have been needing a rain coat and saw this one on sale so decided to try it on i do wish it was more fitted but it is pretty cute the embroidered detail is nice too bad the xs petite is sold out i have no idea if it will hold to the rain though
4,i recommend this product if you are tall the pants fit great but they are too long im and they drag on the ground
4,overall good battery is not so well
4,this top is a classic subtle sexy top great for casual wear and especially to go on a date the hem of the sleeves have a slit neat detail small fit me well width wise but sleeves are too long in pass my wrist but i cannot roll them up because the bell shape does not hold and i cannot hem them because they would lose the original stitching i am ftin b waist no petite size so i passed cloth and stone is better in making petite size but not for most items sad for us shorties
4,purchased in november less than months ago for use in my then new samsung galaxy s it has never been removed from the phone until today when it failed since the phone is still fine and the memory card is stored well inside its safe to assume this card has suffered no abuse today the card is totally unreadable it cant be formatted by the phone the pc doesnt see it at all its dead jim ill be contacting sandisk about warranty todayupdate ive updated this from start to because although it failed sandisk is replacing it at no charge sometimes stuff fails if a manufacturer will stand by it that speaks well nice that because i bought it on amazon i could search my orders and find the original invoice to use when i contacted them
4,my family all loved this i added a lb hamburger but my year old said it needed more next time i will add more but it was very good
4,for the life of me i cannot figure out the absolute terrible takes that the rotten tomatoes website has on actually good tv shows and movies they literally called this a cw show with wednesday addams i was shocked because ill be honest this is probably the best experience ive had watching a show on netflix since the first season of stranger things not only is it one of the best shows ive seen this year but its probably one of the best things that tim burton has done in a very long time jenna ortega is the best part of the show but all the other characters are extremely likable as well and nobody is perfect which is also the thing that i like the most is that everybody in the show is flawed its not super over the top cartoony dark like some of the movies are but it takes a little bit more of a realistic approach with the addams family personalities and relationships the burton monster elements are still there though and they are awesome to watch if you look at it more through the angle of wednesday trying to find empathy and a reason to care about the people around her you get a lot more out of it so for me personally i really dont understand why snobby critics just accuse us of being a cheesy teen drama with a consensus that you would see on cw because it has a lot more to say than those types of shows and its also very smart in the approach that they have with the addams family and their relationship with each other and the people in the town that this takes place in please give this a watch this is a good show
4,i love this dress it is amazingly comfortable and flattering i would think to many body types i have a more athletic petite body build and this dress gives me great curves i have already received so many compliments while wearing it out the best part is i can wear it to work im a teacher and then wear it out by easily dressing it up
4,i was concerned about purchasing this dress when i read about two slender people buying it im lbs and athletic i normally wear a and i ordered a the material is really pretty but stiff more like brocade the cut is different and its not form fitting or feature enhancing but its comfortable and looks attractive the arms and neck are not binding or cutting they are interesting touches that make this different from other shifts its lined falls a bit above my knee but not
4,got these in the red brick color and unfortunately had to send them back these are really cute and i loved the color and pattern but they ran very small and the cut between the legs and hips was odd this may not have been a problem had i gone up at least one size best to try them on if possible
4,nice value for money display is good and also key is very smoothly press and very nice performance draw back but only one draw back is speaker sound is slow
4,ordered both the black and white and ordered both in and p preferred the black over white and the p fit the best however they reminded me too much of a maternity top so they both went back if you order you will need to wear a cami underneathat least i would not a terrible top just not for me
4,got it in bbd its an amazing machine working so good got a good deal thanks flipkart
4,this suit is super cute i think it will be too short in the body for taller girls i am pounds c and bought the medium very cute fit but its almost slightly too short in the body maybe if you are smaller on top you will get more length in the body i really want to keep this suit i might consider the large but the rest of the suit fits perfect
4,the red detail at the shoulders is pretty and i liked the contrast between the red and white the fabric is soft and comfortable it is a sweater knit fabric more substantial than you might guess from photos the sleeve ruffles were a little poofy for me and combined with the loose fit it made me feel a little too girlish this could work for you if you are looking for a peasant style blouse with a forgiving shape and nice details but it wasnt quite right for me
4,i wanted to love these the fabric was soft and they were good quality but they fit differently than the hyphen chinos and were too small sadly i had to return them
4,its nice lightweight lets see how good it perform later
4,the first season was awesome to watch a never seen disease turns into a pandemic causing havoc around the world and now a smuggler and a immune girl only hope for humanity must survive the infected people a dictatorial system and some rebel groups to find the cure for the survival of humankind the first season of this apocalyptic survival drama is one the best i came across with each character has their own character development story and how they have survived all the events unfolding around them the second season is more on revenge pretty high on emotional quotient and less on survival and finding cure which will probably be extended into season a perfect survival drama has turned into a series for personal vendetta and revenge since the last of us part ii game itself has uncertain ending i hope craig mazin finds the magic pen to write a perfect ending be it in season or season or beyond otherwise another series which has perfect start will end like game of thrones
4,it is obviously too soon to review the show since only one episode has been released nevertheless that one episode was so good that i could not resist writing one the production of the show seems really good maybe thats what is expected of any hbo show but considering some of their recent projects this is definitely a positive point of the show wirth mentioning the acting is indeed solid regardless of what people would say about casting before the show was released the story is wellpolished and captivating and is perfectly fit to one episode i do hope that the rest of the show is as great as the first episode
4,what a beautifully created show this is wasnt sure if i would like this but oh my god i was obsessed with it just after one episode and literally binge watched it in just one day and man i was surprised like how much i love wednesday addams its such a new creative show and its funny dark horror thriller fantasy mystery its everything i would want in show or movie its different from other shows these days the dark humour witty dialogues wednesday attitude of not giving a single eff about anyone just love it huge applause to tim burton for creating this masterpiece and casting jenna ortega as wednesday
4,i tried this jacket on and found it extremely flattering the knit is soft and feels more like a sweater than a jacket in that it isnt constricting i am usually between a small and medium and the small was plenty big the fur collar is a special touch the one i tried on had several loose threads hanging from the seams and the seams puckered a bit here and there i loved the jacket but did not feel that the quality in construction i would expect was there however the fit is so flattering i m
4,just finished the second season and thankfully it was a vast improvement on the first of course reacher exists to be implausibly overthetop but the setting and setup for season two was far more fitting or i wasnt yelling oh come on back at the screen as much the dialogue in the second season was more interesting and real as were the characters and the multiple geographic locations sure its a big dumb action series but i appreciated that the second season wasnt simply all big set pieces and kill shots i wasnt thrilled that one of my favorite characters met his end it had its cliched moments for sure but the improvements made on reacher were very welcomed looking forward to season three
4,the laptop is very sleek its gaming laptop but still looks very professional no rgbs no unnecessary designs perfect for me got it for k during bbd sale and its the most worth it deal ever if anyone is planning to buy it make sure to wait for some sale and get it below k the battery is decent works for hours but just plug it in everytime its a gaming laptop and you get a w charging brick the keyboard is really good backlight is white and not rgb theres no wobbli read more
4,its value for money
4,the melon color is soft and flattering it is a little on the long side in the back but i paired it with a lightweight flowy sweater and received compliments
4,the handmaids tale is one of the most infuriating depressing and most difficult to watch shows ive ever seen you keep waiting for things to turn into junes favor or all the terrible people in the show to get what they have coming to them but it just never happens it just keeps getting more and more depressing and hopeless there are little victories along the way but it takes until the end of season before you finally get some satisfaction having said all that its still an incredible show that is so well acted and written that it is always nominated for all the major awards june is a character the changes so much throughout the show shes almost unlikable by the time season arrive there is no doubt that some of the show is excruciatingly slow but its worth it to stick with it its probably time for the show to come to an end soon and i hope it has a satisfying ending
4,oh yes another sequin top to add to my collection it is sparkly without being glittery if you know what i mean can definitely dress down as it is tee shirt like lots of options for this one tts much better in person than the online pics
4,i just bought this in the yellow and am very pleased the sleeves are super long but im happy about that usually they are much too short this is much cozier this will look cute over dresses and with jeans and a longertunic style top nice quality too
4,i will be brutally honest here i am not a fan of disney star wars i actually hate what they have done to the ip as much as the next guy but andor is so criminally underrated and glossed over by the fanbase i have to add my cent to it because simply it is so well written and acted that it is a crying shame it is not on everyones lips the writing of this show is so phenomenal and the acting so nuanced and onpoint i keep pinching myself to make sure i am not hallucinating the whole thing i am talking about preseason got level of dialogue exceptional cinematography and nuanced messages i am so impressed with how the quality of the show increases with every passing episode that i get this giddy excitement we used to get in anticipation of the next episode in breaking bad better call saul and early got you are doing yourself a great disservice if you refuse to treat yourself to this hidden masterpiece yes obiwan sucked yes the sequels stank yes you are so bitter and hurt by disneys castration of every beloved sw character ever but please watch this and i promise you will not regret it i do not care who runs the show if andor is any indication of the direction disney is taking sw i am on board and if not and they plan to keep pooping on sw i still thank them for andor it is that good of a show
4,so well balanced not at all disappointing surprising upsetting and hopefully i feel i can comfortably forget about
4,works as expected i was able to successfully upgrade my samsung galaxy s memory now my photosvideos are being saved to the sd card
4,it is a good item just not what i was looking for if you want a medium waist and straight at the bottom it is great i am more of a high waist skinny bottom
4,display and battery are the below average other than good
4,battery also good no issue
4,making this today as i have all ingredients think ill half it though as its just the of usthink hubby will love it
4,they seem to only have sets all the characters are the same and whats worse is theyre dull zero character development or empathy i couldnt care less if a single one of them succeed or died i cant say the acting isnt brilliant as are the few special effects and sets they have but i always felt like the scenes were shot metres from the last scene the whole series droned on with what felt like not a lot happening to this day i have no idea what was motivating the characters severely disappointing as i really wanted to see a smart british gritty gangster series back on our screens theres more heart in episode one of sons of anarchy than this has in an entire season and im not a fan of anything thats is on the face of it americana usually i was told by friends to hang on for season but i shouldnt be crawling through a whole season before i find entertainment and when something horrific happens at the beginning of season to two of the known characters and i found myself not caring i knew the writers hadnt earned my investment something similar happens in another series soa to a character you dont particularly like and yet as a viewer i still felt myself empathetic toward the characters plight and wanted vengeance for them the writers wanted to spend too much time on posturing monologues which all felt and sounded the same than building the characters im sorry to say im just wholly disappointed
4,ill say it again andor is one of the best pieces of star wars content ever made and arguably one of the best shows on disney every episode feels cinematic from the cinematography to the dialogue to the action its pure cinema yes the time skips are annoying and the pacing is painfully slow at times but by the end youll be dying to watch rogue one all over again watching rogue one after watching all of andor truly feels like the full experience as you go into episode a lot of the content between is worth watching for the full experience highly recommend andor is by far some of the best though for sure
4,peaky blinders could have been amazing as miniseries but it gets too long and too cliche after season tommy is an underdog who faces a goliaths and this happens exactly in each and every season afterward the producers tried to keep the story amusing by eliminating some characters or creating some corny duels who we all could guess whos gonna win all failed attempts only two promising point in the whole series was _although you see no kind of satisfying changes or growth in any characters of the series there are some good characters like tommy polly and campbell and _ the ending was acceptable but overall i wont miss the blinders if there wont be any sequels
4,i am and b im usually a s and that is the size i bought i loved the fit of the top and wore it immediately then i washed it just as the instructions said and the liner shrunk about just as another reviewer stated and the sleeves were much tighter and a little shorter however i loved the top so much that i took the top back to the store and exchanged the store was super understanding about it and i was able to order the same size its back ordered but once i get the new top
4,it is a really cute sweater i thought it would be a little longer based on the picture on me it hits at my waist but i am still okay with it the design is unique and i am happy with the purchase
4,i would not slow cook chicken breast for several hours thoughno point saute for minutes and add to the beans at the end and leave for about minutes to cook through otherwise a nice change from the usual i had a similar dish in arizona and it was surprisingly good
4,i love this top but i do need to wear a navy cami underneath as the pic shows the lace in the mid section makes it completely sheer in place kinda odd placement in my opinion but if you dont mind the sheerness or a cami its a great top
4,i would have loved this tee but the color didnt love me its sort of a mustard orange the embroidery is beautifully done but i felt the size of the yarn tassels were too big and looked a bit odd but i have a large bust so dont like to draw attention there its a sweatshirt and not a tee shirt but it flows and doesnt grab anywhere it looked so nice under a jean jacket if it werent for the color and tassels it would be a keeper for me
4,this top is beautiful and i have received so many compliments on it the fit is very complimenting and i would continue to wear it often except that the fabric is unraveling the bottom of the lace has raw edges so i would expect some fraying there but my top is shedding long streaks of material with each wear throughout the entire top strands of the lace unraveling isnt exactly a great look
4,this wasnt bad but i thought the green pepper overpowered everything and i like green pepper i used spaghetti sauce and added some garlic powder and fresh basal to the sauce i think i will try again but will put mushrooms and black olives on top and skip the green peppers definitely worth making again with some tweaking
4,this blouse if very pretty and feminine i agree with the other reviews that said it emphasizes the size of your hips i dont have any so it was great for me
4,i bought a xs in black i like the weight texture and thickness of this fabric it feels like it smoothes over and holds the lines of my body in well may be the other reviewer got a pair out of an odd batch which could mean there are inconsistencies i would like to see how the color and the stretch holds up with future washes it would have gotten five stars since if it came in petitte length but i will pick up a couple of more if it hits sale
4,story is forced to roll but plots are dull an boring the worst is the acting the main character is a joke i understand the trend of a minimalistic face expressions but a good actor will identify with a character from inside this guy is just bad actor very bad in fact the visuals are great though led walls and ue at its best set design is ok for the most part art directing is solid actors and camera blocking are fine no self promotion of the director however a good director should get more from the actors no matter how bad they are this rating is after episodes maybe the show will evolve in something more intriguing and more dynamic
4,i bought this lovely cardigan in the orange color it is so beautiful and feminine i wore it buttoned over a slim tank and got several compliments right off the bat it is a sweet and unique take on the classic cardigan in a way only found at retailer i usually wear a small and it fits true to size i did have to return the one i purchased because it had a hole in the sleeve but thankfully was able to order another on sale its a no brainer
4,the dress is very cute probably more on the casual side i ordered the petite and it hits me a few inches above the knee which is what i wanted the material of the dress and under slip is a little thin but it looked nice after i ironed it the top part of the dress looks great and shows off my shoulders nicely
4,best in tha market good product awesome display and good sound quality performance is very good and day to day malti tasking using very good but bettery backup normal tha product very nice and build quality is better in this price light weight if any one need so go for it
4,i made this soup but added cup of cooked bacon and tablespoon bacon drippings my family devoured it
4,love accurate sizing feminine details my new favorite top
4,i honestly never even tried this on i ordered it and when it arrived it was not the kelly green color pictured it was more of a dark bland green color love the brand and very soft but had to return
4,looking forward to episode this is star wars the visuals the dialogue and the action the ending of this episode made me yearn for more whose kid is that
4,very time consuming to make a lot of steps and ingredients the taste is that of a snickers bar so for me it is not worth the effort i followed the recipe exactly and made sure that each layer had set up in the refrigerator before adding the next and let sit over night before cutting the fudge cut into perfect one inch squares
4,these shorts were exactly as expected they are nice thin shorts perfect for a hot summer in texas i have just worn a few times out running errands in high degree weather and they were perfect i bought the grey and they are a nice change from jean shorts but still match just about any top i typically wear a size but after reading the reviews purchased a size so i would say they run a little small they are slightly snug in the waist but i ordered online and liked them enough to kee
4,we watched the first season of this show with curiosity we thought it was well done and smartly written with irritating characters whose stupid stories were surprisingly captivating then we watched the second season and the first episode was painful the characters were unrealistically annoying the music was italian for tourists the whole thing was full of clichés but we gave the season a chance because we kept reading such good reviews well these are a mystery to us the following episodes did improve a bit which was not hard but still failed to reach a decent level characters either dont evolve the three men with italian origins or they evolve too quickly and randomly the shy hooker plots are either non existent the two couples of friends sooo boring or they are ridiculously outlandish the rich woman who was also in season so far fecthed a pity really the idea is good and the cinematography is excellent but the realization is too weak
4,its very good looking cool
4,like others i think this is just lovely on so many levels however ____________ pros great color will match with many things great design at the sleeves and overall the vneck part isnt too low fabric is pretty comfortable and breathable for the most part _____________ cons it is boxywide for my height and weight the medium fit well but i noticed it made my torso look shorter plus im a c not huge but to retailers standards ive had issues with things b
4,all are good but delivery is delayed please flipkart support to your customer
4,i ordered one size down and its still plenty roomy as others have said the sleeves are a tighter fit but there is a tiny bit of stretch to the fabric im smaller busted and didnt want the vneck to get too low so i sized down one very cute tucked into jeans or paired with leggings
4,i love this tunic in the carbon color on the model the color does look different in person more of a lighter gray on me the tunic runs very large i am usually a small or medium but took the extra small in this and still have room i agree with the other reviewers about the pockets they do add bulk in the hip area so if this is a problem area for you id avoid this tunic overall its a nice tunic for everyday wear the tieneck adds a nice detail and makes the tunic stand out it looks g
4,laptop performance is excellent the battery comes only hours plastic is delicate be careful you will get scratches easily the display is nice if it is between k to k it will be good because of the battery and delicate plastic used for the laptop
4,its been a month now with this sdcard in my phone i transfer an average of gb of data to and from the device per week the sdcard is holding just fine where most tend to crap out or cause problems this has yet to do it
4,the cut and design of this dress is lovely the fabric is heavy enough for fallwinter but the sleeveless style makes it a great transition piece for when the weather warms up again it does run slightly larger than most other retailer dresses i sized down to a from a the bust stretches a bit for the ladies who might be heavier on top im a dd however i noticed the white shows through in dark places around my bust also the boning in the front pushed against the fabric a bit
4,this one was totally beyond any expectations witty cynical brutal fun charming much better than the cruise movies alan ritchson was spectacular yeah and then comes the second season lame naive mild tiring tedious stars or less sad
4,i really liked jim and austin soso ashley big no
4,i ordered an xs regular and it barely skims the floor when im wearing wedges or heels perfect its form fitting but not clingy and i think its a pretty comfortable dress glad i made the purchase
4,this is kinda boring there is not much story in short min episodes entire plot of first season can be summarized in couple short sentences second season is launching platform for spinoffs with new characters i guess no one told disney that you need good show to begin with as a foundation to spinoffs in conclusion i have to say that mandalorian is still best star wars entertainment of last couple years which says a lot
4,im pounds xs petite was a good fit with room for a heavier top fabric is somewhat picky so long sleeve is necessary overall coat is beautiful and worth the money nice unique fall piece
4,when i first heard about the last of us i couldnt wait to see it because i absolutely loved the video game on top of that im a fan of pedro pascal and hbo has a long history of making the best shows on tv then i saw the trailers and my excitement grew even more well its pretty bad its not the worst thing ive ever seen but i had to force myself to finish the first season i kept telling myself that it would get better but it never did like many have already said its not like the game at all i couldve gotten past that if it was entertaining enough but its not even though the first season wasnt the best i still have the second season a chance and its been much worse they got rid of the best part of the show and their lead why i get you want to have a show where anything can happen but killing off your lead and the most talented actor on your show is not smart
4,very comfortable and soft i wish the neck was a bit lower and it runs on the large side i am wear a i ordered the l and it was very big on me will try it in the m though im worried that it will be too high in the waist on me
4,i ordered a gig card and the card received states it is a gig card though it only hold gigs of data i got ripped off i did not check it until after the days had passed but it appears to be some sort of scam the card is clearly marked gigs and i have checked the card in two tablets and two computers it is only a gig cardedit the company directed me to a tool to reformat this card and i was able to get close to my gigs of data though i do not like using third party tools i have windows mac and linux systems and any of those oss should have been able to format this card correctly i will minus a star for having to use a third party tool otherwise these are great cards
4,good performance till now
4,im a huge fan of the novels and was never convinced that anyone could live up to reachers legend i was wrong the first few minutes of episode that stare down that right there was jack reacher i hope that we get a ton more series and i cant wait to see which book comes next supporting cast were excellent i have been smiling all day since finishing the series more please amazon
4,everything else is fine but battery seem to drain quickly
4,pros good efficient cpu with good battery life good for every day work no issues with software like crashes or something cons display is least attractive feature in this gb ram is fast but is not upgradable and is only good for basic work very good laptop overall and reliable for basic tasks and longevity
4,this dress did end up working out for me however i am very narrow in my chest and shoulders and i can see how it would be too tight on anyone with a medlrg chest andor broad shoulders the fabric is light weight nice for summer it will need to be ironed and will wrinkle easily but it still looks well made to me the slip is smaller than the dress but i feel that the dress is supposed to be drapey i kept it
4,i got this number in the turquoise and i hadnt expected the skirt to be ribbed are they all like that retailer was out of the petites so i sized down in a regular instead yeah that didnt work i definitely needed the petite version and perhaps should have even sized up the bust was scandelously tight in the end the dress wasnt flattering on my figure the way this style usually is on me the proportions were off somehow its just not one of those dresses that curvy petite girls shoul
4,i made for a church function today and used crushed tomatoes and added another can of mushroom and a heaping teaspoon of minced garlic but pretty much kept the rest the same oh substituted wine for the water and next time will definitely add wine to the sauce the bottom layer was too dry so will add sauce to the pasta before putting that layer down and before adding the burger to the sauce probably will make more sauce but all in all pretty well receivedthen again could probably be very good without layering and just mixing it all together definitely would cut prep time
4,best laptop in segment ok go for it
4,very usefull to use in the phone also they come with the adpator to sd i will remomend it
4,i have to get up at am every morning to give my dog seizure meds i knew i liked this show when i caught myself thinking that i cant wait to get up so i can watch some more i am and was skeptical but this show is well done the acting is great and so is the cast if a show has bad acting i will turn it off even if the storyline sounds interestingthe fact that jenna can play the cello after only a couple of months shows her extreme talent for the arts and her kind of character would be tough to pull off as well she is a joy to watchgwendoline christie is also one of my favoritesactually i havent spotted a bad actor yet the storyline is also very interesting to me this kind of show isnt for everyone but if you give it a chance and go out of your comfort zone you will most likely enjoy it
4,nice quality material the green is pretty color just a good cozy top i normally wear a large in retailer clothes and the large in this world was very roomy which was fine with me if you are short and have smaller shoulders and bust definitely go for a size smaller than you would normally wear
4,best at this price owsom
4,so what do i think of it well to be honest i think it is the best tv series i have ever seen in my currently years of life i admit that i might be a little biased as i usually have a thing for the gangster genre but i guarantee that anyone who feels that way will absolutely love this
4,good card for the price lots of room for music plays in the sansa mp without any difficulty or trouble
4,i love the color of this top it is a dark olive green and elegant i mostly wear it under a blazer with my jeans it fits true to size and the smocking detail is casual and elegant at the same time
4,it took me about or episodes to really get into it and at times some of the thick british accents were difficult to hereid just put my ear buds in and enjoy it on my tablet this is one of those shows that comes around every years or so but if anyone reads my little input be advised it will take you on a incredible ride now i find myself looking everywhere for a date or anything about the th season enjoy
4,i was looking for a classic white tshirt that wasnt too big ie a tunic or too fitted this was perfect i love the irregular hemline and the fit its not too tight but not too big either where it looks messy just a perfect little tee for any wardrobe runs true to size im a d size and ordered the medium it fit great
4,this piece is very comfortable and feels well made it is not slimming
4,having never heard of or played the game i watched without any preconceived ideas or expectations i laughed i cried i jumped i shouted at the tv the connections between all the characters felt palpable through the screen joel was such an amazing character full of depth and such perfection on screen pedro pascal was the perfect casting even without knowing the games before hand he just completely embodied joel bella ramsey was an absolute joy to watch ellie was just so badass she had me laughing out loud as well as crying the writers and game creators deserve every award going it will be a series i will watch over again
4,very good i doubled the recipe and will finely dice the onion next time my yr old son loved them
4,i purchased this on one of retailers off sales and got it for a great price if youre looking for a pretty comfortable tshirt thats a little beyond the basic this fits the bill unfortunately the neckline was just a tad wide for me in the xs i felt like it might show a peek of my bra and when i adjusted it higher the soft stretchy material showed bra lines underneath that issue and the fact that the shirt is on the flowy side made it lessthanflattering for my small frame but i
4,this is a cute top especially the material design i like tops that go over my bottom and this does if i had a problem it is with the sizing the fact that it was only online so i could not try it on made it difficult to know really what size to get some reviews said it was true to size and others said go down a size i did go down a size but it still hangs a little big but i still love the overall look i am also petite which is what i ordered
4,this was such a cute suit but strange how they designed it top runs super low and it almost did not cover my breast area runs small i had to return because fit was way to small for a large suit
4,awesome laptop value for money
4,product is awesome
4,i love love this top it is a very pretty casual top it looks very nice on and is more like a tunic perfect with jeans very casual but the embroidery ruffle sleeves and buttons at the top add a nice touch i have the red i am considering buying this in blue as well i have so many newly purchased blue tops
4,this was a fast and easy recipe my grandson who hates mushrooms loves it he is years old he just pushed aside the mushrooms and ate the soup the base must be it i made it exactly how they said and it turned out great very pleased
4,sounds good cant wait to make it
4,i was on the fence about ordering my normal med but so glad i did it fits sooo well i do think its more suited for warmer days since the material is very thin its sort of a cropped length and looks great with sandals and heels i dont like showing off bra detail and will add some kind of closure detail to hide bra or wear a very lightweight top underneath this was a great buy especially with the sale
4,these trousers arrived today yippee i really wanted to love them i do like the color and the cut not crazy about the foldover waist the fit through the waist hips and thighs is true to size the biggest issue is that the description states that the inseam is which is perfect for me however these pants are actually in the inseam which makes heels a necessity if i want to wear them without altering them i rarely wear heels these days so that does not make me happy one leg
4,this recipe was great but i got so frustrated when the chocolate kept cracking while i was cutting it does anyone have a solution to this problem thanks
4,i got to the nd episode of the nd season im tired of constantly being preached to by hollywood they have no room to be so sanctimonious this show has so much propaganda so blatant and some subtle i tried to give this a chance and finally turned it off when they jumped the woke shark
4,my granddaughter wanted this for her phone so she could put songs on it she loved the card and its capacity
4,i tried hard to make this work because it is beautiful but ended up returning it first it is very delicate material i was terrified trying it on second i just couldnt make the drawstring work for me to achieve the fit i wanted third it was too low for me and would need a cami over the slip while i didnt think the colors were as deep as the picture it was still pretty i could have possibly gone down a size to fix some of my concerns but then i know it would have been too short for
4,as a very thirsty and disappointed star wars fan this series is simply refreshing im baffled as to how many times they got it wrong with the exception of rogue one as of late before dropping a gem like this for all to enjoy i feel my i resonate with many reviews on here it gets star wars right it is honestly some of the best character oriented storytelling where the product doesnt suffer or feel flimsy for inane reasons its just great writing mixed with some fantastic directing theres so much that this show gets right proper strong female characters having an appreciation and respect for the original source material in a way that doesnt create unnecessary inconsistencies various acknowledgments of and references to the star wars eu commonly exhibited approach of less is more which leads to no distractions and a fine balance between build up and payoff that the viewer is genuinely interested in i find that star wars has suffered in this department the most as of late great casting choices i could keep going but ill stop myself while im ahead i highly recommend the show to anyone that is into star wars enjoys scifi especially if youre a firefly fan or good character oriented storytelling in general disney please dont screw this up with needless meddling let the people working their magic to their own devices cause this series is singlehandedly carrying the entire franchise on its back right now
4,dont gudg the show from the first season wait for it until the second season begins you will regret if you dont see this show enjoy the rest
4,design is very nice but battery performance is hour only charging speed is better
4,this was kind of boring by itself but a good standard to add green chilies and spices could probably also use only one cheese
4,only binged thru four episodes so far but this is way more reacher than cruise could ever create most of the actors are relatively unknown which helps create a clean slate for the new reacher on the downside havent we done the small corrupt southern town thing long enough too many fights early with reacher whupping ass with every redneck in town but its what we expect huh lady cop thats a fixture in all reacher books is played really great tough and sexy and watch the show
4,i really love the look of this sweater and it seems to be of great quality i will say the fit is a bit odd the sweater is on the short side but is very roomy through the neck and shoulders i ordered a small lbs and would change for an xs but im afraid it would be cropped im keeping it but wish it had a more uniform fit really beautify workmanship though
4,great fit a little stiff i typically wear a and was able to take a in this skirt though a would probably have been fine its just a fun skirt with a little shimmer to dress up an outfit
4,this chromebook for any competitive exam students for mock test and lecture evrything you can do
4,looks nearly exactly like the picture will be very comfortable to wear i ordered a petite large and could really have worn a medium its big all over i figure ill do a little tailoring on this come spring and adjust the fit on the whole happy
4,pretty good came out golden brown and served it as a side dish with red beans and rice i used skim milk but otherwise followed directions next time i would decrease the sugar a little bit maybe cup but otherwise no changes makes plenty
4,this dress has a beautiful fit lbs ddd and the medium regular fit great the only issue is that the bottom part of the dress wrinkles terribly when i bought it the woman folded it nicely and i stashed it in my car for the rest of my shopping trip when i arrived home and pulled it out the bottom of the dress was horribly wrinkled plus its dry clean only going back
4,i love that these are a nice thin stretchy material not in a bad or cheap way because they are perfect for the warm weather as well i got the color grey in a size i usually wear a in stevies so they were tts maybe a bit tight in the beginning but they do stretch a little with wear i did try on the size but they were a little big around the waist for reference i am lbs size m the fit of stevies are perfect and hugs in all the right places i have wider calves and it
4,very comfortable runs a little large purchased a medium and probably should have gone with a small
4,im between sizes in deletta m to l g i ended up purchasing the large in both black and sapphire it does fit a bit tight in the arms and torso but its a nice basic top for work and does well with changing seasons
4,this poncho is lovely i found it fits perfectly im and got the xssjust long enough loke jacket length and the hood doesnt add extra weight doesnt drag it down the back arm holes are approriate size very cool piece for any weather layering
4,it is a beautiful dressbut didnt fit methis is better for someone tall and thin
4,great pants with a couple of quibbles these pants have mini blue stripes in the fabric so in real life they look a bit more blue than they do in the photos these are not white pants but they would fill the faded blue denim niche in your wardrobe and also like faded blue denim these pants are more opaque than most lightweight white pants are these days you would not want to wear black underwear with these but likewise your undergarment choice would not be immediately apparent compa
4,great featureperfect lacingdo not need to worry that it is too low since there is material behind the bottom of the lacing like length sleeve gives top the right proportion
4,tried and tested this skin quenching night creamits of a very light soft texture and when applied at night soaks into your skin making it fell so soft would recommend this product to my friends and family as it works wonders this review was collected as part of a promotion
4,a very nice fall into winter tunic length is long enough to wear along line as a dress with tights and tall boots i found it true to size the color of slate blue is beautiful
4,i love the lace up design and bought the red xsp fabric is a bit thin and mediocre quality but over all happy with purchase wish this top came in navy and white as well even a navywhite stripe would be a fun option too thanks you for offering this top in a petite size
4,delivery me bahut time laga otherwise all performance good
4,i have been using the ith gen variant for the past months pros good screen good performance good speaker volume good battery backup ssd speed is good cons keyboard not good skips few keyslike i sometimes need to press again second ssd slot does not work very big disappointment
4,i didnt look close enough when i ordered and failed to see that this was a peplum top it did not do my postpregnancy body any favors but the collar area detail is quite nice and this would look great on the right body
4,bought these in had to return for a p love them i order the other colors
4,this is a cute top but the sleeves are super long they swallowed up my entire hand when i put my arms down to the side i also found it to run slightly large i ordered my usual medium and i had too much room under the armpits the sleeves werent as fitted as the model shot either which i would of preferred i probably could of shortened the sleeves but didnt think this style top fit me so i sent it back this does not require a cami underneath
4,actors are fabulous coolidge being the best there are only types those who hate and those who love it it seems pretty obvious that those who hate it seem to all feel its some white people attack others like me see characters that are funny as hell rich as hell and are terribly flawed if you dont get annoyed theres something wrong you are supposed to get annoyed the music is addicting its overall a great show compared to other shows on right now i gave it an but may up it if i like the ending
4,great recipe but for our family i will omit the thyme next time i did increase the broth by cup to make it creamier
4,my review isnt really about the jeans i want the top
4,completely terrible characters are so unlikeable unredeemable and unwatchable there is not one character in this entire series that is bearable to watch only surprised i watched the entire six episode season
4,good balu for money
4,love the weight something i can wear winter and spring
4,this is beautiful on it flatters the figure nicely the material is a rougher cotton which seems oppressive for summer even though thin it is very low cut but it looks wonderful
4,this is a great product but with over production comes some small issues at times my phone will say that my card is damaged sometimes so i have to reboot not sure if its the phone or the card i got of these one for me and the wife hers never have any issues i can live with it it happens every so often
4,its an supernatural suspance thriller series but i predicted the main villain in th episode netflix also promoting lesbian culture in that series i dont know why western writers promoting lesbian gay culture so desperately performances jennaortega looks beautiful and smart as wednesdayaddams hunterdoohan looks cute as tylergalpin and all others artists also fabulous job technical good vfx work good screenplay good dialogues average writting final words normal audience will enjoy it more because they cant predict the suspance but pro audience may predict suspance of the show in rd or th episode
4,overall good in this range
4,i love this shirt except that the hook that keeps it close doesnt work a lot outside of that i love it i typically wear a small or extra small and with this shirt the extra small was perfect
4,just watched episode its a long time since a tv show made me cry absolutely beautiful but utterly devastating episode to find something so beautiful positive and strong in the midst of so much horror was amazing then have it played out so perfectly to its untimely end cannot praise this high enough the writing the acting the direction im told it plays out differently in the game which made the episode even better in my opinion sometimes these shows can turn into gratuitous shooting fests but the last of us is so refreshingly human centred so far looking forward to seeing what comes next
4,i dont understand why the gpu doesnt go above watts of tgp in any game and the main reason why i went for this laptop was tgp but still as i earlier had a acer laptop and didnt want to regret again so went for it overall good performance design display adaptive sync everything appreciated speaker asus software support but one thing i regret is could have went for acer with gen core cpu gb ram but had seen its gaming review fps were trash so not so sad really the only complain wi read more
4,best show on tv i look forward to wednesday nights keep me coming
4,the product is very nice and ok for the pricebut the battery runs down easily
4,this is a great cake for strawberry shortcake we usually prefer biscuits but this cake is a nice change i reduce the sugar just a bit cup less as its a bit sweet i also add a pinch of salt i bake in a inch pan for minutes check with a toothpick minutes before the directions state you dont want a dry cake when i sugar my strawberries i keep them a bit tart to offset the sweetness of the cake this is a little bit fussy but it really is a delicious cake
4,i so love the substitution of cottage cheese i much prefer it to ricotta as i think ricotta tastes kind of dry great recipe
4,i was pretty bored watching this series when season ended but boy what an amazing season and season they had strong storyline and kept me gripped from start till end now i too am a peaky blinder and eagerly waiting for season
4,as written this is just ok to m fairly good but not stars for my taste it is similar to mine except for a x pan i use almost x the beef
4,very very good but not the best ive ever made
4,beautiful top the body flows nicely and the colors are wonderfully vivid it goes with everything and looks great for work or going out my only gripe is the sleeves are really tight i struggle a little to get on and off but once on it looks awesome
4,ideal for children
4,its not always fun but it always keeps me fascinated and on the edge of my seat an incredibly made show based on a groundbreaking book by an amazing author
4,these pants pair well with anything dress up or down boots or sandalsbut beware they run big and rear end stretches out when sitting at work all day if you have a booty these pants will be perfect buy one size down tho if you have a flat rear like me then buy two sizes down length is good to leave uncured just above ankle or roll up to perfect height great color fabric is amazing
4,overall good product good performance liked it
4,best in price with quality
4,only issue is lower battery backup speakers are avg too but overall package with amazing display and backlit keyboard made me buy this
4,nice for this price point but i think performance should be much better
4,its a good product but my only regret is that i should have gone for the tb variant rather than going with the gb otherwise this is a great laptop
4,i love the ease of style of this dress perfect for summer and to wear for a cruise the only problem with the dress is that it comes unlined if it was lined itd be perfect if you plan to wear this over swimwear its great if not make sure to wear neutral underwear since it is partly see through would need to get a slip along with this dress im and got a s p i could have easily gotten the xs the dress hits in slightly lower on my thigh than what is seen on the model
4,easy to make and a refreshing new way to eat grapes
4,i am writing this review after month using this laptop pros the performance is very good and it is very fast in processing it is very lightweight cons this laptop is fully made of plastic after full charge it lasts upto hours it has no backlit keyboard
4,got this in gray pretty good quality all around good basic
4,very flattering and flowy dress would pair this dress with cowboy boots or navy wedges
4,this is the star wars we have been wanting for so long last two episodes felt to me like a separate movie series mandalorian is filled with emotions epic fight scenes humour character buidling was also great loved it all the way jon favreau and dave filoni thank you i have spoken
4,i really was not sure what to expect when they first announced the witcher mainly because i disagreed with some or there casting choices however the majority of the cast are fantastic in there roles especially henry cavill who is bloody brilliant as geralt i know for those who have not read the books or even played the games might be really confused by the constant jumping of the time line in each episode but wait til episode it all comes together and sets up the rest of the series for even more epicness i have also seen some people saying they completely messed up a part from the books however i never made it to that part in the books before the show came out so it did not bother me as it probably wont bother people who have not read the books all in all i was blown away with the fight scenes and the monsters after finishing season i was left wanting more i do however have nitpicky things i would like to point outcomplain about first all of the characters are casted great except for triss she just doesnt seem to fit the character described in the books and is far from the triss in the games second they got the look of that certain creature wrong in that one episode even in the witcher lore it says they have legs not the legged ones are wyverns but even these things arent enough to ruin this awesome show for me im sure season will have a bigger budget and be even more epic
4,product is good received it from indimart seller product was fully sealed packed battery backup is upto to hours continue usage laptop handled most of the triple a game quiet good
4,everything great with the otter our little one is completely in love with him also the battery wear is manageable
4,i love this dress length falls as shown on model im not sure if this fits true to size or not i am normally a medium and kinda wished i would have ordered a large i find that the neck is too tight and have to loosely tie it also the lining is smaller inside and it ends up causing the arm hole areas to roll inwards so i feel like the back end up being sort of cape like its rather weird the large may have too much material though but overall i still love this dress minus those few fla
4,this top is very cute however it runs quite large i ordered my usual size xs but it looked rather heavy on me the construction of the top was boxy and didnt produce the same feminine look as it does on the modeled picture its a very cute design but i would order a size down for a better fit
4,im short and curvy and just had a baby love this cape because its super comfy and warm but not too warm have had it for a couple of weeks now and its my go to for running around during the day the description says grey but it reads a tiny bit green like light camo green but so slight that it still pairs well with most everything usu a med but got the xss because of how slouchy it is anyway med looked too big in the shoulders
4,the show is so funny and entertaining that we watch each episode several times back to back love it love it love it
4,the color of this dress is amazing even though its not lined the fabric looks and feels like silk charmeuse and is so light and comfy on your skin more of a maxi than a midi on me im considering shortening it elegant and breezy at the same time love it
4,this is a very lovely tshirt because of the color and design it has a very nice shape as well as the sides are not just straight across its perfect for leaving it untucked the petite fits really well no too long or too short my only complaint is the the material while really soft is also quite thin so im not sure how durable it is
4,loved the way these felt but like the previous reviewer said it did run slightly large i am usually a size or m and the legs were a little baggy wthe medium since the m is sold out im going to try and see if they shrink in the dryer the color and design of the ankle is different from other leggings which is a plus im and they are the perfect length
4,this shirt is incredibly soft i was drawn to the style based on the feel of the material and the cute tie up detailing in the back definitely size down the sleeves were a little snug but sizing down will help with the length and the bust my only problem with this shirt is that if you bend over anyone can see down your top so be aware otherwise the top is great and perfect for summer
4,the sweater is thinner than i expected but very cute so im keeping it it seems well made so im not expecting easy snags it washed well
4,ive purchased these in the past and found that they wear well so i came back for some new colors this year i ordered blue holly a deep olivey green and grey to try and found that they all fit slightly different the navy fit me perfectly in a size im lbs but the holly cords were tight in the legs and i couldnt button the top the grey was somewhere in between i also felt like the grey showed more lumps and bumps the navy is super flattering
4,i wish this came in a petite size im going to do my best to add some stitches in the ruching to keep the middle taught im busty ddd and the suit had plenty of coverage and lift i will need to make additional loops in the back latch but this piece is worth all the extra work i was surprised this worked so well for a short curvy figure i ordered a medium
4,this is good recipe i prepared it last night
4,this was a delicious recipe i used soy milk instead of normal milk and it was a good substitution i also used canned peaches instead of fresh or frozen and it was still delicious though i would say to reduce the amount of water in the topping by about cup and honestly i might suggest doing that anyways it was a lot of liquid leftover
4,we love our otter unless the batteries last very little or is that the belly with your breathing fails
4,i loved this top however had to return as it does run small by the time it arrived they were sold out in the larger size like the quality of cloth and stone however their products do run a size small
4,i tried on a returned p in my store they were almost the right length but the fit was more snug than pictured here i have muscular thighsbutt and lbs they were nice though kind of a skinny pant the carbon is a dark grey can go with anything only gripe is the waist height is low at least on the behind i would certainly show if i bend down without a long top
4,good product value for money very fast delivery
4,i loved this dress so much but it just didnt work im not particularly busty b but it just did not work for me i sized up several sizes from what i usually wear and it still was tight on the bust and then just looser around the arms as i went up such a beautiful dress though great quality and really adorable fit for someone who is built for it
4,kudos omg to the series an osm crafted series this is my first genre of mystery spooky comedy mixed which turns out to be a great feast omg jenna she is such a darling i just loved her character and the acting was worldclass i liked the way she is those accusing face and spooky eyes she just killed it with performance the whole lot series stands on her its a mystwry spooky drama which i loved it the most brought me harry potter vibes with the outcasts and normies special kudos to the character enid she was supportive and all others did their roles to the best not a episode boring and carrying forward for more waiting for season jenna ortega love you tons became a fan of you please do watch it available in netflix
4,i love this dress the fabric and overall design are beautiful however the dress fit runs small at least for me i ordered a size based on the reviews i have another byron lars dress in a size that fits well i kept the dress because it is so pretty
4,i really love the front of this shirt however the back of the shirt is more of a jersey material so it doesnt seem to match the front of the shirt i still wear it and it looks cute but it threw me off a bit at first
4,as a long time fan of the books i was thrilled to watch the faithful adaptation that season was script casting action and plot all first rate i watched the whole season multiple times it was that good so what happened to season the script which is laughably bad is not helped by the acting which is appallingly wooden across the board even alan ritchson looks uncomfortable in his own skin the action this time round is a jumble of frenetic jump cuts and quick pans a sure sign that the actors youve hired cant manage a convincing fight scene and the plot which is childishly straightforward lacks any of the mystery or suspense of season or indeed the source material reacher is a lone wolf who doesnt play well with others saddling him with three inept sidekicks who spend half their time belittling him and the other half on dull domestic subplots masquerading as character development only end up making our hero play second fiddle in his own story everyone involved with this debacle should rewatch season and do better next time
4,im usually a in retailer dresses and i was surprised how well the fit i like that the dress is navy instead of black which makes it even prettierthe embroidery is very nice without being too much to wear for more casual activities fabric is thick enough for wearing out in autumn with some tights and a sweater prettier in person
4,bought the gb ram varient at k then upgraded the ram to gb which cost me k gb samsung ram buy samsung or crucial only for reliability a ram upgarade is a must to maximize the potential of this laptop and its performance their are still some issue like minor lagbeing careful with hinge if u have seen the design its a strong hinge but the way the have been assembled but it it depends on person to person on how they used satisfied and somewhat ok with read more
4,right on trend easy to wear but a bit snug in waist which the vendor gave item specific sizing to make the selection of the size a bit easier
4,very nice laptop profomence very nice
4,i was excited to get these pants at a great price i am these pants were plenty long enough for me they also have a nice light textured design thats hard to notice in pictures the only problem was they are a side zip pant which i didnt know when ordering i dont love the zip on the side for my shape it so im still wondering if ill keep them other than that nice pant
4,great dress for a party or a more conservative event love the style and fit a little hard to get on and off
4,i ordered these in eptites tey were a ltitle long still also a tiny bit on the loose side i am not sure i think they are worth as much as they cost so wil lwait for hte sale color combination was nice thougha dn the cut relatively flattering i jsut ahve seen better out there for hte price nice businesscasual pant
4,i have read most of lee childs jack reacher series books reacher is tough tall fast and master of street fighting a sherlock holmes when it comes to solving mysteries primes reacher is all that but unfortunately the actor fails to humanized for lack of a better word his character watching the first episode my girlfriend thought reacher is animation produced by a computer program he is like a robot something like the terminator even terminator could spark some emotion compared that to the witcher he starts the first episode talking to a wounded animal lee childs stories fail to attach the events of the books to real world locations the way michael connelly is able to do with harry bosch primes reacher would have benefited from a slower pace more character development first before jumping to fight scenes instead reacher doesnt even talk for a long time to start the first episode i think i will still watch the series but i wish they had done more than some smart comments is there a man nailed to the wall inbetween the fight scenes
4,this dish is wonderful my husband and i enjoyed it be careful not to over cook the noodles enjoy
4,value for money product pros good design fingerprint full size keyboard i th generation performance is top notch ssd speed is great cons below average display viewing angles are bad sound is not too much loud speakers are bottom firing no backlit battery backup average overall a all rounder package satisfied
4,a work colleague suggested it and normally i would have thought meh cowboys no thanks well how wrong was i intense plot and characters so much unexpected events my best tv watching for a very long time that same work colleague has been to that part of the world said its not like that
4,i love jenna ortega including her performance in this show as well as her other co stars the point is i thought this would be another show for kids since it depicts gen zs and modern day culture which is something kids with poor taste in mainstream cinema will like which was very cringe i stopped watching after that episode one scene where jenna was walking around the the statue of joseph crackstone and the song space song by beach house started playing like it didnt even fit the scene and just ruined the song for me which makes it clear that this show was heavily influenced by gen zs plus jenna only got famous cuz of some cringe show but when she was in other good movies like x the fallout or scream did yall even know her before
4,i absolutely loved this dress and when i received it it was exactly the way it lookedfit online the material is so pretty and the fit was amazing it was a bit wrinkled but im used to ironing things so that didnt bother me unfortunately i had to return it though because of the color im filipino and this yellow just isnt flattering on someone with darktan skin yellow is a tricky color for me to begin with but this was more of a mustard yellow and just totally wrong for my coloring
4,after two fantastic seasons reacher season is an absolute letdown it feels like an entirely different creative team took overand not in a good way the storyline is convoluted and frankly dumb the writing has lost its punch replacing sharp dialogue and tight plotting with mediocrity even the acting suffers likely because the cast had so little to work with what made the first two seasons greatreachers sharp wit brutal efficiency and nononsense problemsolvingis buried under a pile of meandering subplots and uninspired storytelling instead of delivering a gripping wellpaced thriller season stumbles around aimlessly failing to capture the magic that made the show so compelling its disappointing to see such a strong start squandered unless the show coursecorrects reacher might end up another series that peaked early and faded into irrelevance
4,i bought the calia tunic in blkwht and in red motif i love the black and white one the cut is flattering and stylish comfortable you can dress it up or down all good the red motif is cut differently the neckline is very low the shape is different from the black and white one i am not sure why but i returned it neither shirt is as long as the one pictured on the model i would recommend the black and white one though
4,i got these in black and i had tried on the gray in the store they run small at the waist i usually wear xs or small but i ordered a medium they are very comfortable on a warm day they look great with a loose tucked in blouse or tee the down side is they catch and the lace pulls and gets fuzzy when rubbing against things i realized this after a day of wear i havent washed yet but plan to hand wash
4,these are almost perfect the fabric feels great and its a super cute print the only downside is that the rise is really long and high i wish theyd stocked more petities because the petites are all sold out and only the super long regulars are left at this time if you are above theyll be awesome on you if you are below you may be getting them altered
4,overall great product
4,great good product but battery backup is not much good only to hrs battery backup camera quality is not good there no alexa buit in support other things are good sound quality mild low but sounds come good im giving start because of product delivery earlier then expected date
4,pretty good recipe i made mine lowfat lowcalorie ground turkey no butter but tbps when sauteeing veggies velvetta rf sour cream skim milk etc would make again but add about oz more cheese this time i didnt think it was cheesy enough tasted better the next day heated up
4,finally andor and here i am really sad a few years ago any star wars event created and exceeded immense expectations today its just another disney series that goes on the air it saddens me that no one is talking about her at this moment when we are facing a series unlike any other there are no masked and pistolwielding bandits here nor are there any jedis and siths in this series there are fleshandblood heroes committed to the courage to start the rebellion and to start a movement you need something very banal and instrumental money it is the money that buys weapons that buys ammunition uniforms food drink and everything else necessary to finance a war effort on the other hand when you cant rob the taxpayers like a tyranny how can you gather resources capable of financing a war all these answers are given to us in this series with subtle acting moments by the trio of main characters it might be said that andor doesnt aim to be epic like the obiwan kenobi series but theres just as much good in it unlike the book of bobba fett as there is in the mandalorian
4,i love this with white leggings that skim my legs bc it is a looser top that you can cinch at the waist one small complaint is that the tie is awkward with the side slits but for the sale price i can overlook this
4,its pretty much a commodity product made in the far east but what i store on it is pretty valuable i feel confident in sandisk manufacturing quality control in the end
4,performance design battery display camera overall value for money
4,i was too late to find my size in petite boo i tried the regular sizing and it was hugea total tent i am about i tried an xs it was gigantic to say the least huge everywhere i love that the fabric is thick but yet doesnt feel heavy or hot i think it would be the perfect summer dresscould wear casually or dress it up dont need a slip what a plus for a white dress i definitely needed a petite size and most likely from the size of the xs a pxxs really i know i have w
4,my husband loved this dish and was happy that there were leftovers for his lunch the next day after reading other reviews i was very careful to make sure i really got the moisture out of the zucchini and was glad i had this came out great i will definitely be making again and may follow some of the suggestions for other toppings like pepperoni or maybe even using the sausage in place of the ground beef
4,performance is best in range but display star viewing angle very bad
4,wow this is great this is a lesson on how to do starwars right great characters great music and a story centered around family and bonds hopefully they can keep up the quality if they can this will be remembered as one of starwars finest outing and maybe its last hope
4,love the dress a little cheaply made but overall it fits nice and will be great next fall it will show tummy shape so if you do not have a flat tummy this may not be the dress for you
4,i bought both the small and the medium and seem to be right in between the small is a tad tight through the shoulders and arms but the medium feels a bit baggy it is soft and hangs nicely i just need to figure out if i will wear it enough to justify the price
4,does what it says a complete handheld windows pc it would have been better if they added a kickstand at the back for when we add keyboard and mouse adding a trackpad would have been really helpful battery is very bad bought it for k on some offers for that price im satisfied but needs a lot of accesories like tv dock and cable protection case tempered glass protection update bought it after a long dilemma between rog ally and legion go but due to non availability of legion read more
4,i love the straps details funny thing though is thsi bra is giving me rounder boobs a little cleavage nto waht i am sued to with a sports bra lvoe the color ordered the purple
4,good for business work
4,lbs purchased size small in rich navy so soft and comfy and i like that the cuffs help the pants not ride even during sleep i like that the fit is slim but not constricting on legs as all my yoga pants tested this at my local vinyasa class and it held up without making me too hot and i sweat a lot my biggest complaint is that the fabric pills right out of the packaging actually their tag says the fabric does this and over time will continue to do this more and more because of i
4,i agree with the other reviewer its refreshing to find a top that isnt all baggy or sheer which seems to be the current trend right now _______ pros lots of stretch this was so comfortable and the rayon lining inside really makes this breathable the ruched detailing sleeves and overall length is great no cami needed with the white i see in the pics on the model that appears to be cami underneath i wrote a nude bra and didnt have an issue at the front because its two la
4,this tee is cute and unusual and i am sure i will wear it pretty often i do wish i had ordered a size smaller than my normal large but i am waiting for it to shrink in the wash a bit the material is thin and it certainly doesnt feel like it is worth the price tag i got it on sale and still think it is only worth about
4,overall its good laptop
4,in this price range its best laptop
4,very good product performance full on battery backup on screen keypad quality very good touch pad mouse very good my thinking all over performance and value for money this is the one of best laptop
4,very nice but ms office kit missing
4,this season had a really slow start with episodes and being dull and lackluster however after episode the show just took off and never came back andor was providing peak star wars with every episode the characters soundtracks acting set designs and cinematography was some of the best since rogue one a show about andor managed to be far superior to both the kenobi series and the book of boba fett the show didnt rely on fan service but rather had its own characters and story overall a fantastic addition to the star wars universe my favorite arc is probably the prison arc but the aldhani arc is a close second my favorite episode is x titled one way out with episode x titled the eye being a close second
4,nice jacket good quality flattering design im lbs bought a size s and fits well love the hood a little snug in the arms if you want to wear a long sleeve underneath overall a good buy
4,the product is generally good however face unlock doesnt always work
4,just a cute casual tee that i grabbed on sale but i love the bow in the back something unique for an otherwise plain tee
4,tried these on several times in store and never bought them but was able to get them with a email seemed like a better price for the product the color is rust and a little odd for my wardrobe wish they also came in black love the style and they are very comfortable perfect for late summer can wear on errands or dress them up a little with shoesaccessories for casual dinner out happy i finally purchased them
4,i dont like how short it is in the back i also prefer a solid vs slubby material back it goes
4,i tried this top in both colors for the black the lining looks much more peach in person the main issue though is the diagonal line that runs through the middle of the top you can see it in the picture but is much more pronounced in person it appears to be where pieces of lace are sewed together and it just looks sloppy the line is much less obvious in the navy and looks much more seamless perhaps because there is a transition between two colors of lace the black lining is completel
4,great performance and good display i like it lots its very good for gaming and value for money product
4,this dress is beautiful it has lovely colors that should compliment many skin types i bought the dress for my daughter as a graduation gift i have not given it to her yet so i dont know if it fits or how it fits
4,i had originally bought this in a medium but needed to return for a small it runs large fits way better in the smallfits in the arms nicely and has nice shape around the body for a full jacket
4,great fabric not too clingy and provides a forgiving sillhoette very comfortable perfect skirt for summer get togethers or shopping may be a little long if you are on the short side one thing i liked is that the skirt draped well and doesnt hang open or slide up recommend particularly on sale
4,this fabric is the same as the turtleneck swing dress by maeve its lightweight and stretchy the problem with this particular dress is the pattern in the fabric will be a little different on each dress depending on how the pattern was cut when it was made i had to try on different dresses to find one that was cut so the pattern looked and fell in the right spots when wearing the dress hence stars the bodice is lined but the skirt itself is not it is not see through im and
4,laptop performance is good and all is good
4,we liked it
4,this top is very light weight and comfortable i am normally a in tops due to my bust size but ordered a based on other reviews it fits great i really like the fit and the pattern it has been a great summer shirt and i can see myself grabbing for it in the fall paired with skinny jeans and a cute bootie
4,i like the retro look but these seem to run large to me i get they are ruched on the sides yet the bottom has a saggy look i got the large but i feel like i should have gotten the medium to fill out the bottom i already took the strip out and washed so im keeping them very cute with a bikini top maybe i just need a bigger butt
4,nice top armholes are a bit oversized but as an older woman im picky about that the print is pretty and unusual it just didnt look great on me theres a slight peplum in the back that hangs nicely its a lightweight tee fabric thats opaque i tried it on with a black bra which was barely visible great for warmer climates but there are so many gorgeous tops out now that i decided to return since summer is winding down i do recommend
4,delicious but part of one loaf was kind of doughy could be my oven its new and we have yet to figure it out
4,i found this dress to be perfect for the winter season its warm sleek and classy this dress is made in the usa so it is worth the price i love the opening on the back and find it be flattering it can be worn with tights for the winter and easily worn without in the summer a wise investment for my closet
4,this is one of the softest shirts ever i agree with another reviewer about the shirt not worth the original price but once this shirt hit the sale item totally worth it
4,easy recipe it tasted really good excellent flavor my only issue was that it was more soup than chili which many other reviewers said it would be nice if it were quite a bit thicker then i would have given it stars i did really like it and i will probably monkey with the recipe some more
4,i did a few things differently first i didnt put all of the veggies in because it looked like way too much i also didnt put in as much onion and instead added some chopped celery because others stated it was a bit lacking in flavor i added some parsley basil and steak rub seasoning i also used storebought mashed potatoesat the end i stuck it all in a dish and put it in the oven at deg for about minutes next time i will also broil it for a couple minutes too like others suggestedone thing i did notice was a distinct sweetness to it i think it was a combination of the ketchup and the large amount of corn next time i will cut down on the corn and add in a different veggie maybe broccoli while the sour cream made the sauce taste good i didnt really get a strong sour cream flavor info for those who are on the fence about adding in the sour creamoverall a good dish and pretty quick when using leftover or storebough mashed potatoes we will make this again with a few changes
4,bought it at launch living up to my expectations and fulfilling the exact needs i bought it for it is absolutely not a product you need unless you want a toy or like in my case it suits your needs i needed something portable and my lightweight laptop wasnt as powerful this while expensive not nearly as expensive as the laptops i was looking at while being extremely portable
4,it was very good i cut recipe in half as there is only two of us i wasnt sure what to expect so i was a little surprised to find it as soupy as it was just thought it would have been a little thicker but still very good
4,comfortable flattering i agree with other reviewers that this is great piece i purchased the red one and it is beautiful fits tts
4,gud
4,one of my favorite series at the moment peaky blinders is a great series due to the good acting beautiful camera work and historical image of the underworld of birmingham in the s peaky blinders is exciting from the first moment because there are immediately different storylines cant wait for new seasons in the future
4,there is concern with regard to speed apart from that everything is good
4,smart intelligent and profound charakter study filled with cringeworthy and hilarious moments on top of the number one theme of our times
4,like other reviewers i tried on a medium and a large as i usually take either size in retailer dresses the large was huge on me i had an extra inches or so on each side the next medium that i tried on could barely fit over my head i looked at the tag to see if i had picked up an extra small but it stated medium got another medium and it fit perfectly however the cami underneath one medium was again teeny tiny the other medium was ok you may have to try on a few dresses to get the righ
4,bought is this month works smoothly and fast till now display is too good and so is the sound quality
4,holy hot wings is right i thought i died and went straight to expletive it was so hot even my husband who loves anything burning his throat thought it was too hoti am going to make it again but this time use much less hot sauce i did use franks as some others recommended so maybe that was the problem i love the ingredients for a dip so im hopeful the next try will be better
4,everything is very good superb performance but battery is very decent its gives hardly hrs backup
4,performance is good display is ok at this price awesome battery life of hours on average and powersaving mode one thing i am missing a lot is keyboard backlit its hard to type in dark room i use this for coding go for it
4,so far it has worked very well stores more that i need which is a great feature another nice feature is the red paint really i drop these little cards and the all black version are often hard to find the red is easy to spot now if it only glowed in the darklol
4,this is a cool relaxed style with the benefit of an open neckline to add a bit of femininity i tried on the faded blue and striped colors in the store the faded blue goes well with the style but the stripe is cute too the sleeves are quite long and too tight to roll up so if you are petite like me you will definitely want to order the petite size and probably even those you who are in between petites and regular sizes the sleeves may also be too narrow for some people
4,i bought these assuming they would be the same as a pair of pilcro stet ankle jeans i bought a couple of years ago this pair has less stretch than my older ones so they are a bit tighter im and these are more like a perfect length regular jean rather than ankle i always have trouble finding jeans that fit my curves but smaller waist these are a bit big in the waist with the butt and legs fitted allinall they are a nice looking durable denim that flatters
4,beautiful sweater but the material is a bit thinner than i was expecting but it hangs nicely and the sleeves are nice and long
4,i bought this dress to wear to a prewedding event at an out of country beach wedding in late fall so i bought it a size smaller than normal but it fits so i could say it runs a little big very cute though and i thought even more flattering than i thought it would be from the picture im more top heavy and it kind of camouflaged that which is always great
4,seems a little small in the width and shoulders length is fine
4,these pants overall are very comfortable but have an unusual fit they tend to run a bit short and i always have to get pants hemmed shorter so if you have long legs or like more draping you probably wont like these they also ran a bit large in the waist and thigh a bit puffy i had to size down in order to get a good fit very good quality and cute design
4,very good product im very happy
4,this was a very flavorful chili i used ground turkey and a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies it could easily be adapted to ground beef as well if that is your preference i would definitely make this chili again
4,very nice basic tee shirt soft and comfortable well cut
4,the only negative about this dress was the placement of the stripe across your stomach
4,i bought this to use im my galaxy note tablet so far so good simple put into microsd slot and began storing data on it
4,decent battery life exceptional build quality lacks features like usbc charger privacy shutter for camera fingerprint reader ms office
4,love the multi textured look of this top to me its like a modern take on a classic sweatshirt im and loved the length to me it is tts but bigger busted girls may want to size up im a b for reference
4,this was a rich dense cake that tasted good the frosting recipe as written comes out thin and runny it tasted good but was not like the picture if i make this again i will try whipping the cream first as others have suggested
4,this top runs large an entire size i am on the fence about it it is quite stylish and well made it is fairly heavy and seems like it would be very warm the burgundy color is nice the issue i am having with it is the way the lower black arms are sewn in the upper arms it just seems somewhat odd overall though it is very forgivingespecially with the black border around the entire bottom it is the perfect top to showcase a great long necklace and it would be great with leggings
4,if anyone is looking for decent laptop i suggest you to go for it genuine review you can do all office workstudent work light gaming is also possible but dont expect much you can play emulator games those work well overall good product if u have budget of k thanks flipkart
4,cute top definitely sheer so need an undershirt really love details on it especially back and fringe at bottom lbs ordered s
4,the casting is almost on point but not quite there in my opinion the guy who played finley is a fine actor but just didnt seem to fit the role and the big let down was that they should have had alan play both joe and reachers roles as theyre supposed to be almost identical with only an inch difference in height the flashback sessions being modified for the tv audience were a waste as there was so much more to the story that could have been fleshed out particularly with the pretense of reacher doing what is right making the first run of the series not only true to the book but far more understandable to the viewing audience but as it stands to non readers this will make no sense whatsoever with that being said i am still looking forward to the next installment as i can only assume that the team will endeavour to be more true to the original stories as they progress through the series of books two to three seasons a year thanks to keep up with the ageing of the cast etc one can only hope at least
4,good performance tq flipkart
4,i got this top in the black floral print the print is very pretty and so is the neckline but the body is very loose and shapeless its not flattering i think the shirt is a little too short as well it would be nicer if it was longer nevertheless it is a pretty top
4,looking premium quality but battery back up hours with internet connection and excellent performance product
4,started off a little slow but progressively got more interesting as time went on rather enjoyable overall
4,ive been looking for a versatile maxi skirt all season the pleats and layered look were a great effect to a really basic navy maxi skirt the waist is elastic great for after baby and will look good with a shirt tucked in and belt the only drawback is that its a little too long and will drag on the ground if i wear flats im soft material with some flowy movement when you walk
4,design is amazing performance is up to the mark as expected battery backup upto hours overall a good choice thanks to flipkart but little disappointed due to late delivery
4,with imdb of and first few episode constant killing give me high expectation on the show but no more than episode in make me feel very bored every problem get solved so easy with barely any repercussions constantly introducing new enemies and then killing them in seconds is not how you keep the flame every character constantly trying to look badass when delivering the lines make its hard to believe or interest john dutton kevin costner is the only character im interested seasons and episode in and i still have several doubts on his decisions and character wild west cowboy theme mixed with politics and indian tribe but none get fully delivered only when its convenient make it very paled the main focus is the duttons have a lot of similarities with the roys in succession similar to the new episode releasing date but i can say that succession had done way better than yellowstone im still watching the show but a little disappointed from the high expectation edit at episode of season i give up boring and overrated show
4,i ordered this online in red i would definitely say this color is more of an orangered i like the weight and the cut i keep wishing the material was a soft modal vs what it is the ribbing up top does not bother me but it definitely does make it a casual dress which is what i wanted so im happy with it it fits me nicely the straps for me could be a hare shorter to fit perfectly that being said im and have a thin build small bust i would say there is a some leeway for s
4,i had been eyeing this top for awhile so decided to snag it when it went on sale im still on the fence i love the material and pattern but it is really long and im it looks very roomy with jeans but i still want to try it with tights and boots to see if that looks better overall i think it is a great piece
4,the only draw back are the slits on the side they are too high and if you turn sideways at some angles you can see your cheeks i will have them sewn up a bit because i love the dress and it is worth it
4,overall a good laptop but with a slight battery issue
4,very optimised laptop temperature wont go so high even after playing for hours the only drawback is it has gb storage and this laptop can only be upgraded to tb per slot that means u can only have tb total
4,best series ive ever seen absolutely no question and ive seen a lot never disappoints and one never knows what will happen next watched the season finale and it was much more than i could have expected hats off to producers directors actors actresses and all involved in every aspect it did not disappoint at all in part of season without kevin costner not at all and that was totally awesome thank you hope you make another great one soon you all definitely deserve lots of awards congratulations they want me to write words or i cant post this review but honestly what more can you say to subserving so intriguing and perfect
4,i was somewhat hesitant to purchase this dress based on the previous reviews for me it fit perfect the blouse was fine not too much fabric the skirt is soft and stretchy the fit was tts for reference i am lbs c and i purchased the p it fits great
4,i just finished eating small bowls fresh out of the oven and my oh my was it tasty although i didnt follow the recipe to a t i had to use bread flour because i was out of allpurpose crazy i know i also used brown sugar instead of white i used fresh peaches peeledsliced and added cup of fresh blueberries upon reading the reviews i decided to go with my own topping recipe i used a half stick of butter cup packed brown sugar cinnamon nutmeg and a splash of milk it made a saucy caramel i drizzled half of it over the batter and baked it at for appx min until the top was browned and i could stick a toothpick in and not have any batter on it very very good
4,the last of us series based on the critically acclaimed video game offers a hauntingly beautiful and intense portrayal of a postapocalyptic world it follows joel pedro pascal a hardened survivor and ellie bella ramsey a young girl with a mysterious immunity to the deadly infection decimating humanity the series excels in blending highstakes action with deeply emotional character moments capturing the complex relationship between joel and ellie as they journey through a shattered world the shows strength lies in its compelling storytelling which maintains loyalty to the game while adding fresh perspectives the performances by pascal and ramsey are raw and impactful making the audience care deeply for their characters visually the series is stunning with meticulous set design that brings this ravaged world to life the pacing may feel slow at times for those looking for constant action but the storys emotional depth and tension are well worth it
4,it works fine in my verizon galaxy s but has to be formated to fat also works in my canon ixus
4,back to hard core star wars thank you jon disney this is out the gate
4,i tried this product in store in red and fell in love with the fit it fits in the most beautiful flattering way red looked gorgeous rich glossy fabric this could easily be one of those effortless summer transition pieces that can go from a day dress into incredible sexy night outfit the fabric was very lush and had this rich gloss to it i have never seen a fabric like that it almost looked coated red being such a statement piece was a bit too much for me so i decided to order the produ
4,a fun top i tried on both the medium and large im between sizes g and preferred the large the medium waist rode up a bit on my torso so the large stayed down a bit also the medium pleats did not fall as nicely on my chest
4,this sweater is super cute and perfect for a fall day however i am ampampquot and ordered a small which was way too long in the arms the sleeves came down to my fingers wish there was an xs i could order because i do love it
4,great laptop in the price range i got it for k a must buy for college students able to run all coding softwares
4,performance is good but it does produce heat a lot especially when charging and playing games
4,its funny because i coveted this top online for weeks but looking at the reviews i kept thinking that it would look ridiculous on me i am very busty and do not like things to cling or be too tight however when i went into the store today i tried on both the cream and the black in larges and both fit beautifully i decided to go with the black just because i thought that i would get more use out of it i find that it fits well though perhaps the sleeves because of the elastic are a tad bit
4,i am short waisted and i still thought the pleats started too high on me also the whole thing was a little bit big i always wear a medium but in this top the shoulders and everything was just a bit large since i bought it online i couldnt size down the fabric was a nice quality
4,ive been looking for a great chicken chili recipe this one doesnt quite fit the bill for my family although its good its just missing that something special maybe cilantro would make the difference
4,just dropped right into the phone with no proble disk works great and give me plenty of room for storage
4,i ordered this top in the solid navy the quality seemed very good and my overall impression was favorable what i liked was that the top stayed off the shoulders even when i was moving so many of the ontrend cold shoulder tops simply do not stay put with even the slightest movement unfortunately this top ran quite a bit large if you are in between sizes i definitely recommend sizing down ive not seen the printed floral option but the dark navy is lovely and looks chic with white bo
4,product is good
4,made this for the first time tonight and loved it with a few changes made the meat my own way adding onions peppers and garlic to the meat and sausage mix and instead of tomato sauce and paste i used a large jar of my favorite spaghetti sauce which cut down the prep time the rest i followed exactly i let it rest for about hour before cutting into it and just reheated pieces in the microwave this was a real hit at my home and i had plenty left over for the next day definitely will be making this again and may try adding hard boiled eggs to the meat this time
4,tasty but a bit bland i think that i would add some onion to this recipe
4,the only reason i gave stars instead of is that it is way too small in the chest if you have anything up therei usually always wear size dresses not in this dress this beauty is a full size too small trust me it is gorgeous but there is no stretch it needs a zipper that said i exchanged it for the size and all the flaws that ive read in reviews disappear the sleeves are better and it falls nicely and is comfortable also there is no lining just good to knowonce you get it ov
4,super laptop ssd fast
4,i first saw this dress in one of the stores and the rich colors caught my eye this dress is very comfortable to wear but is also unique the fabric feels great on and gives the dress an overall stylish flair the photo doesnt do it justice
4,the cut on this is fantastic every color way is vibrant and appealing length just skims over where my hips broaden which is nice and my shoulders look strong and tan however i prefer cotton or at least a cotton blend this fabric is appealing in that the sweat wicks the colors will never fade and the shape wont change i find the man made fabric very very hot though
4,wednesday is a go with the others series in addition to having the tim burton touch the series is yet another typical netflix production that mixes everything it has ever produced to try to make something original and is yet another series that the main target is the teenage audience otherwise the series will be boring and you wont even want to watch the rest but also the things that are saved such as jenna ortegas performance and tim burtons direction in the first four episodes apart from emma myers because she and jenna ortega are great together and deliver excellent work together
4,all i honestly have to say is that who they chose to play gomez is terrible wheres cancel culture when you need it he doesnt fit the bill at all out of all the hispanic actors they could have use they chose a rd rate actor what happen to a gomez thats accurate to what hes supposed to look like i feel as if everyone else was a great casting choice the choise of wednesday was perfect the casting for morticia of thats how you spell her name was also great heck pugsley was even incredibly casted lurch is possibly my favorite character casting in the show he is casted what does everyone else think
4,lots of special moments lovely scenery and above all the music is the best
4,nice looks nice performance and nice battery but improvement required in battery time length

4,nyc leptop with batrry issue
4,i loved this dress when it came out this summer but it quickly became impossible to get i snagged up this one as quickly as i could when it came out i dont really love any of the fall colors it was offered in but for this one i would say it is much more rust and less orange in person
4,super sweet otter to fall asleepin many reviews it is mentioned that the otter is not so cuddly it is already soft and cuddly however you should not forget that there is an engine in the otter this ensures after all for music and the abdominal movement and for that it is quite cuddlywe find the otter great and make it go to bed in the evening
4,good grief if the pilot episode is any indication this will be a nonstop thrill ride normally i will wait for most if not all of a season to drop before i begin watching so that i can get a more immersive experience the last of us may be too hairraising to binge watch and taking a break between episodes might be a good thing the video game that the series was based on was given life by creative director neil druckmann who believed that storytelling had become secondary in the game industry and set out to create a rich narrative in the last of us this source materiel provides a good basis for an action series like the walking dead it takes place in a dystopian america after a fast moving global pandemic has wiped out the vast majority of the population leaving the corpses reanimated by the parasite disease the original video game was inspired by a bbc documentary that featured a killer fungi which invades the bodies of ants and can exercise basic control over the insects motor functions in the opening scene of the series pilot an epidemiologist explains that his worst fear is an evolved fungus that is created via global warming so the pilot was crazy good it grabbed my attention within minutes and reeled me in deeper in every following scene it appears that hbo spared no expense to bring the world of the last of us to life its been estimated that each episode costs between m and m and the shows budget might even more than game of thrones i cant wait for the next episode
4,this was a great simple recipe but like others i did have to improvise a bit the batter was super thick so i added about a halfcup additional milk and i added an extra tablespoon sugar since i am american and finally a but if vanilla just improved it enough to make it wonderful
4,display is not upto the mark the graphics card is also a bit outdated for modern games but it is good for moderate gaming and other graphic intensive tasks
4,it was a bit of a coincidence that i started watching this series the title seemed a bit familiar and ive probably heard someone talk about it in some podcast or something it is an exciting series about a group of people who spend their holidays at a luxury hotel in hawaii in season and in sicily italy in season the series explores their lives relationships and dark secrets it is a clever and quite original mixture of drama dark humor satire and mystery its well written and the acting is really good i liked season really well but season was even better in my opinion i highly recommend this show although i dont think it suits everyone
4,this was really good but also very sweet we really enjoyed it but like other reviews i will cut back on the sugar next time i will be making it again
4,one reviewer said that the th season is a disappointment i totally disagree yes the peaky blinders have moved from their original turf but people grow move on grow up they are still the same people but circumstances change the real peakies didnt last long a short lived era this show is fiction and can live as long as steven knight and the actors agree to allow it to change with the times the word out now is that it will end at the beginning of world war that feels like a good ending after that there can be spin offs which if the quality continues as is i for one will continue to savor this mythical dirty addicting story i feel i have to add to this review as i skim over the complaints the nitpickers and naysayers i feel this series needs one more explanation this show is not a documentary it is fiction it is entertainment and it fulfills completely if you overlook the unimportant details the cigarettes they use are not tobacco and pretty much everyone did smoke then the booze is flavored water or juice the cars have license stickers on the windshields push button locks and seat belts not available during the era the true music of the era would make a good comedy for our current times so music that fit the tension the mood the anticipation the atmosphere was chosen from the enormous selections available today and i feel they did a brilliant job of selections i could go on and on but ive said enough watch the show binge like i have eagerly await the next season and put your prejudices away while bathing in the shadows and blood and acting and writing of a fine piece of cinematic entertainment
4,tried these wipes instead of my usual ones for the last week they removed my makeup well and didnt leave my face feeling dry at all would be good if they were slightly thicker but good considering the price would buy again this review was collected as part of a promotion
4,i tried this on in the store and almost considered buying it until i looked at the price tag i think its unique and interesting i just dont think its worth the the fabric is nothing special and the construction is not complicated enough to warrant the cost i would consider it on sale retailer has more interesting sweaters made with softer blends for a similar price all things considered i dont think its a smart purchase
4,this dress must be pinned on the model in the picture i ordered a small although i really needed a petite small but it was sold out it is incredibly billowy very billowy i love the print and the material but this dress is just so very voluminous i may have it professionally shortened since i am only and the dress hits just below my knees im hoping that helps since id really love to keep it
4,i ordered ths thinking it was likea blazer but it is soft and not structured like a tshirt however it is rather flattering on i had a har dtime deciding whether to keep it the regular size was fine on me i usually require peites but this doesnt come in petites and it was really nice with the fitted cowl shirt i was wearing i am definitely putting it back in my wish list as i did end up returning
4,this is so good season u must see it i would rate
4,this is formulaic predictable and strangely souless very disappointed
4,love this dress very flattering fit though it runs big i usually wear a sm and got an xs in this dress the only concern is the fabric is thin but love it nonetheless
4,this reminded me why i love star wars thank you jon favreau
4,i love peaky blinders and the acting of cillian murphy and tom hardy everyone is good in whole show the theme music is fabulous
4,lbs c waist typically wear between a or in maeve bought an in this blouse is incredibly sweet the white is beautiful but i opted for the black bc it seemed more internship appropriate the front and back are completely different lengths not a traditional highlow the fabric has little to no give and the back has buttons running down size up or sizes to avoid popping buttons gorgeous with jeans or pair with some fun cigarette trousers cartonnier for exampl
4,this laptop for full students and office work ryzen u is capable of cyber security work and practice etc multitasking battery profomanc is good for normal use to hours and normal heavy use hours samthing good battery profomanc and fully heavy profomanc hours that good battery charging hour mint its good thanks for lenovo
4,great fit in waist hips and butt i wore them all day and they did not stretch out i am tall but the length of the jeans with the cuff is a tiny bit past my ankle bone i want it just above the ankle bone so i am redoing the cuff slightly and then i must send these to my tailor to close the cuff completely they look silly when the big cuff isnt at least tacked in place perhaps by design they were left this way so each of us buyers could find the proper length and close the cuff ourselves
4,this is a very yummy way to use up some rhubarb i added some cinnamon and nutmeg into the custard part of the bars and cut the sugar just a tad i also used a whole brick of cream cheese and more like cups of heavy cream for the whipped cream part of the topping and i think next time i will just double the topping part altogether it is so good all in all this recipe is a definite keeper next time i will also up the sugar in the crust just a smidge as that part still needs something more
4,great basic recipe i added teaspoons tuscan seasoning onion more celery more carrot minced garlic and more chopped celery yum
4,good product but type c port is not available
4,this was really good my family all enjoyed it good leftovers also
4,i loved the way this top fit and i am a total sucker for floral prints i took my normal medium lb unfortunately the material was very thin scratchy and had a horrible chemical smell back it went
4,the show is fantastic but this crybaby mentality that the writers have about columbus and the treatment of indians is old sad and objectively false yes the indians had horrible things done to them it they gave as good as they got however after years of constant warfare against europeans and americans they lost woe to the vanquished such is the way of human history
4,this is absolutely delicious however no way does it serve we had for dinner and have enough for one person to have leftovers it is not as high as it shows in the picture three layers is just not that high i didnt add the fake crab and dont think it was missed i will definitely make it again and pass on the recipe
4,i originally bought this for myself but it was way too big on my backside since i dont have much junk in the trunk i decided to pass it on to my sister since it was just too pretty to return it fits her much better and shes worn it on a few occasions it does run larger and the pants are very long definitely have to be either hemmed or always worn with heels
4,i got the orange motif skirt in s im and so it fits snugly but doesnt need hemming which is great when youre petite i love the design and that it has pockets but its a very full skirt and seems to visually add a couple of pounds to your middle if you have a shirt untucked over it but its beautiful worn with a tighter shirt tucked in the color is more red than orange to me as well which is a plus
4,very interesting material the very subtlelight window pane pattern is perfect
4,i love tracy reese designs because they are so feminine and figure flattering this dress almost hits the target its just a bit off on the bodice especially at the back and sides the pleating balloons out too much im sure a little tailoring will fix this its up to the buyer if thats worth the money to do it for myself im just wearing a thin cropped cardi to hide the billow since petite was sold out i took a regular size which is the smaller of my size range the length makes this
4,i have been an imdb member for some time but this is my first review i enjoy this show so much that i just had to say my piece though the show itself is great i have to say its elisabeth moss that really makes it i enjoyed her in mad men and even more in top of the lake but in this series she is incredible she says so much without saying a word you feel as though you are going through this ordeal with her i looked at many of the other reviews especially the negative ones before writing this this show is not for everyone but i was surprised at how many people gave poor reviews with the statement that the show was unrealistic really its television of course its unrealistic who wants to watch real life the point of watching movies and series is to get away from the real world and momentarily be pulled into another reality that being said i think this show is very original and i got pulled in from episode i was so looking forward to season and after watching the premier i am not disappointed thank you to everyone who creates this show but especially to the performance of elisabeth moss also kudos to alexis bledel i couldnt see you as anyone but rory gilmore until now
4,best laptop good performance battery backup is less
4,were now on season unbelievably instead of naturally declining as is the way with most series the acting writing editing music sets costumes lighting dolby special effects just keep on spectacularly improving peaky blinders is a must what a magnificent cast what terrific interwoven narratives hugely exciting funny heartbreaking and entertaining watch it right now remember arthur shelby knows where you live x
4,i bought this for my galaxy s to expand the memory capacity a bit more it works as it is intended to do fast transfer rate no problems so far
4,plop will always be plop no matter what show or movie he is in
4,i thought the colors would be brighter and i didnt realize the lace would be see through i returned it because it was also shorter that i expected but overall it was a nice dress just not for me
4,product is very good but speaker is very low quality msi
4,this is a fun watch its definitely a cool addition to what we know from the movies the casting of wednesday is a very good fit the parents especially the father not so much but theyre not main characters so thats forgivable its also shot very nicely quality production here the thing that really stands out is that some writersproducers really did their best to load a lot of moments with a pc political agenda its really distracting from the storyline and kind of undermines the character arcs you really can feel the boardroom meeting kindo of influence in this script but hey its what we can expect from netflix nowadays it would be nice if they didnt to make this truly a timeless series but too bad if it didnt have this i would give this an but i can only give it or because its distracting from the show
4,this dress has a flattering and fitted cut which perfectly compliments the unique eyelet fabric it is at once elegant yet casual perfect for the office or better yet afternoon tea in a far flung british colony of yesteryear which brings me to the buttons putting on this dress makes one wish one had a ladies maid but the effort is well worth it for this stunner of a dress as others have said it runs small and tight in the chest and is not for the well endowed i am a petite and fit
4,performance is slow but does the job at this price range but overall everything is good for basic tasks
4,cute romper love the pattern but the material seems cheap and flimsy and is staticky for the price it should be better quality also im fairly short and hits high on the leg not sure how anyone taller could make it work
4,this show doesnt deserve it deserves like at least in my opinion because this show should be putin from within the masterpiece ones like sherlockbreaking badgotthe wiretrue detective etc and i really dont know why this show is rated from the rated shows its really underrated it should be within the shows that has rating above easley
4,very pretty dress but the fit is not great i have to get help to take it off because its tight in the shoulders
4,saw this come up on my recommended list a few times so started watching last week and it hit the binge bar so much that we watched all the episodes in about days i laughed literally out loud several times guessed incorrectly twice which i never do as most shows are predictable and was startled once great cast characters story plot twist and detail totally looking forward to the next season
4,i tried this on instore and would have purchased if it have been a better price it wasnt something i could justify spending bucks on its cute and was surprisingly comfortable but again not worth the asking price i will buy when it goes on sale
4,i am on the fence about this dress as youll see the reasons below but it is really breathable fabric and extremely comfortable _________ pros tons of stretch to the top part im a c so a lot of retailer tops are too snug for women with some bust however i fit into a medium here without it being too snug you could actually go down or up depending on how loose or tight youd like it to be on you the bottom half the skirt feels so nice on the skin very breezy it is layered an
4,love the detail and the way it hangs i sometimes struggle with blousy tops because i have a larger chest but this one didnt make me look pregnant i purchased this with the off i wouldnt have paid full price for it
4,just a complete package balanced performance no lags or glitches buttery performance
4,nice but screen quality is low
4,i love this top the beading and detail is wonderful i actually liked it even more when i saw it in person but when i tried it on it is really small in the neck and arm openings and seems short definitely a different fit than how it appears on the model im trading in for a size up and hoping that does the trick
4,no pocket tees minimal vnecks didnt see a single cutoff way to much flannel stars
4,relative needed a new sd card an upgrade from her gb and this did the trick great for any phone
4,i have to say most of the user ratings on imdb are quite misleading this is one of them the storytelling is incoherent it is messy it is not about the virus it is about how the relationship between a man who has lost his child and an immune teenage girl grows but the story wanders here and there too frequently and loses the plot if it is trying to be about more than this relationship just dont attempt it just focus on the girl and the man you are nowhere close to getting it dear writers the plot and the dialogues are absurd and funny sometimes not realistic given the bacground while watching this i remembered the episode in the walking dead about the two small girls which moved me deeply this series is trying to evoke your emotions and appeal to your feelings but the whole series did not even move as much as that single episode of the walking dead is for the acting and the sets make up it is a shame that much better series dont get the attention they deserve i read how the boardwalk empire had to be hastily brough to end due to lack of enough audience and how hard time the wire producers had to keep the show going people i suppose are after content bungeable on popcorn easy to digest easy to follow without much cognitive effort unfortunately that does not leave us with much but intelectually very hollow series and films we just went through a global pandemic guys come on
4,tim burton and crew have hit this one out of the park masters of the craft in this genre it could have been a huge failure but they told the story as authentic yet fresh the entire cast fit into this kooky world brilliantly the new characters and world that was created for the show far surpasses any expectation that i had the story tied in wonderfully and seamlessly to the addams family world jenna ortega was absolutely the perfect wednesday each character had a reason to be there and even though they are not the main story you still want to get to know them too season pleased
4,very moist and light cakelike not dense like the usual banana bread i had to bake for the full minto get it to spring back in the center
4,it was very tasty but hard to cut into portions my husband said hed prefer it if i made the filling and gave him the tortillas and cheese so he could make tacos with it that would solve the cutting problem it is really just a big taco in a dish
4,this is a very cute and unique top i absolutely love the back which makes up for my indifference of the front im a little heavier in the middle so it hides it a bit but the light blue from the back that shows on the sides makes me feel a little wider its not perfect but i like it enough to keep it i got lots of compliments on it when i wore it its very comfortable too i just wish the front had a little more to it or was a tad longer overall very happy
4,the product is very nice value for money
4,i somehow missed that there was a slit in the front of this tunic below the buttons it looks fine on im just wondering if i can still pull it off with only leggings underneath why i got it otherwise just as pictured im lbs and got an xs
4,the speaker quality is not too good and also the brightness is just okay it some has software glitch that breaks the sound during session rest it is a value for money gadge
4,i enjoyed the first two seasons a lot perhaps this is bias having recently been playing the witcher at the time of watching the show but its fight scenes visuals and performances were thoroughly entertaining if you are not familiar with any witcher media then you may find it a little confusing as season begins telling two stories in different time periods featuring the same characters in parallel season is a massive let down i enjoyed the first two episodes and after that the story slowed dramatically characters begin their own journeys and dont achieve the goal they set out as well as make irrational decisions the plot is far too confusing it spends a lot of time around the political aspects between the different geographic areas but its far too convoluted and doesnt give you a reason to care you probably wont remember whos on whos side and where they are from and what they want because the show does a poor job of explaining this ultimately everything the season builds up to comes crashing down in a poorly executed climax all in one episode its akin to being stuck in neutral and then suddenly driving off a cliff the worst part is this episode is not the final or penultimate episode therefore the rest of the season feels wasted as the story does not progress any further the visuals and action scenes remain very enjoyable the performances are still stellar particularly henry cavill as geralt and freya allan as ciri season tells a story that could have been told in episodes max in episodes despite this the story is still incomplete and not satisfactory i cannot currently recommend this show to anybody as there doesnt really seem to be an audience for it fans of the source material will find an unfaithful adaption people new to the witcher may find it confusing and if you dont then the show isnt that great anyway since the release of season instead i recommend playing the witcher wild hunt its a fantastic game and a much better use of your time seasons
4,very cute top does require a strapless bra as the straps are further out than most tops and they also tend to fall down also while the top fit well the top button gaps are far apart and tended to separate to show my chest easy fix with a snap sewed in
4,fungible micro sd card that works as expected now for filler text to get past the idiotic word count minimum
4,very good i will make again i backed off on the flour and add a little more milk broiled for min after minutes
4,this series was amazing it was interesting until the end and infact i watched all episodes in one day and i watched it a second time because its so beatiful jenna ortega is a phenomenal actress and very underrated in my opinion about the series i loved the gothic style i loved the atmosphere the story and the characters were very good of course wednesday is my favorite character i loved her attitude her style and her character development this series is very interesting and has a lot funny moments i didnt gave it a because the only thing i didnt like was the love triangle between wednsday xavier and tyler didnt make any sense and in my opinion ruins the wednesday character in coclusion go watch this series and i cant wait for season
4,good product it arrived extremely fast and performs just as described it was considerably cheaper than any other store i found i specially like the speed of this sd card however do keep in mind that the speeds tend to be exaggerated the speeds are way faster than normal sd card speeds and you will notice it but not anywhere close to whats advertised there a lot of factor that go in to consideration when it comes to the advertised speed this is not the manufacture or seller fault but it depends on the system that is being used
4,this was very good but i forgot to trim the fat off the chops the casserole was a little too greasy im going to try this with boneless skinless chicken breasts has anyone tried this
4,simple pullon pant with a great design they look flattering on and can easily be dressed up i wear between a and and the small fit perfect i have washed them and worn them several times and they still seem good as new the wide elastic waistband ensures that they stay in place
4,mahto
4,tried on standard xs and the photo online is slightly misleading as i thought that there were more colors involved in the embroidery pattern in person the pattern is not as intricate with only solid colors the body of the shirt is light airybillowy not as form grazing like on the modelwhich i dont mind i still love the top but would have to go for a petite xs or even a petite xxs so that it would be a little more fitted all around note that the embroidery on the dãcolletã feels lik
4,i used ham pieces in broth that i simmered from leftover baked ham bone instead of a chicken base because i had it on hand we like cauliflower and ham so i thought it would be good it was
4,nice product battery life to hr display very nice look awesome
4,we dont eat much mexican food but i tried this recipe it was quite good i used olive oil instead of the oil listed and eliminated the cumin chile powder and red pepper flakes i would make this again thanks
4,good except battery
4,absolutely delicious plus is a light dessert after a big meal
4,i liked this sweater in the picture but was less impressed when i saw it in the store it looked a bit odd and perhaps cheap to me still i decided to leave it on my wish list and got it as a christmas gift once i tried it on i really liked the way it looked and felt its flattering comfortable and looks great with jeans its really cozy i rated it tts but you could almost size down on it
4,im enjoying white lotus episodes in so far but i fell already it just cant compete with the amazing benidorm serious both have similar plots based on dysfunctional familys in holiday with shock moments in the storyline but working class british humour beats the spoilt rich americans all day long white lotus has a very good cast and is very enjoyable to watch and im looking forward to seeing how these characters evolve over the coming episodes and series rumours are rife that there is going to be another series of benidorm in the making so white lotus will more than do until then
4,sandisk is simply one of the best sdhc microsdhc memory card manufacturers that i have used for a number of yearsi have experienced zero failures and they are reusable over and overalso their adapters are quite handy to carry when traveling or at the studiowould like to see sdhc cards in the to terabtye in the near future
4,if you have been following the daily constitutional scandals since january you will see the similarities between these threats to america and this tv series stay tuned for season two of the series and the trump attacks on american institutions such as the fbi and the state department
4,the jacket runs large so size down its a good jacket to throw on the go but i dont see this lasting long bc after he first wash it started piling the quality of the material isnt great
4,i have three pairs of these so i must like them the fabric is soft and comfy right from the start i think they might run just a bit large or small depending on the color you get i tried on a pair of pink ones in a in the store i wanted the moss color so i had to order that and decided to order my usual size they fit pretty much like the s in the pink but this fabric stretches so im happy with them theyre not too boyfriendy so not sloppy and you could dress them up wi
4,my family really liked this casserole the next time i make it i want to try other veggies and meat i think you can do a lot with this and it will always taste good
4,hi i hope you read my message im not a critic or a filmmaker rather i am a viewer of the film or series please please finish the series well i prefer the series to be great with two seasons rather than boring with seasons i hope mandalorian is the best imdb series with fewer seasons like chernobyl series thank you very much mohsen bigy
4,omg its not hard to say that its one of the best season ever made the concept and the vibe are just on another level the main thing about it it teaches you about respect and also gives you a lesson that money isnt everything
4,pros nice design better battery life upto hours for normal use like working on ms office and hours in watching videos cons backlit is missing at this price
4,nobody cares you arent special because you love sw more than anyone and have been a fan all your life and only you really get what sw is all about nobody cares this show is great so far dont listen to the sw superfan neckbeards who make up a infinitesimal percentage of reviewers here they hate it which means you should probably like it if you like star wars and dont have a chan login you should dig it
4,its an adorable take on the casual sweatshirt i love the layers but i wish they were just a little different they hang a little strange perhaps if the bottom one was a smidge longer im not sure or if the sweatshirt layer was a little longer and the blouse bit was therefore longer it all hangs just a littleoff but its not so off that it looks bad im petite so its cute on but i think if you were tall it might hang a little weird a warning though i ordered a small and the
4,i immediately fell in love with the little one when i saw him although i spent some time with the little one because i dont let any children sleep here myself i finally got him i always have friends with her baby to visit and thought so i could give the dwarf a more pleasant time here if we sit longer the little animal is really very cute however with me the picture is much better set in scene than the original the good one looks something as if he had run against a wall but beside the flat somewhat wide head it is still quite inseparable however if the content is not there the electronics can be removed very easily by a velcro lock in the back and operated the surrounding body which therefore represents the otter is soft and fluffy but to me almost thin you feel the content nevertheless very strongly and i have some concerns if the child would roll on it to be lucky babies that will be quite rare here i would have just wished for some more light the edges are not clearly the same as well as well as the rest of the rest
4,this series stands out in every aspectcasting production design camera work and direction every single actor delivered an exceptional performance elizabeth moss as june and yvonne strahovski as serena were especially phenomenal between the two i found yvonnes performance even more captivatingher subtle expressions are intriguingly complex and deeply affecting the use of camera angles and actor placement is masterfully precise the story itself is stiflingdark bleak and emotionally heavy yet despite the despair it portrays the series remains a work of creative brilliance should be part of ciriculam in acting and filmmaking schools
4,i added some rice and avacado to my fajita it was delicious
4,this is a very good product every product has some demerits so do with this product positive value for money pretty good display i th gen gb ddr ram gb ssd gb nvidea gb intel graphics best for coding as i personally doing app development decent gaming also performance packed product negative no type c charge so cant connect to duct avarage battery life slightly heating issue with heavy weight softwares like visual studio oracle sql no ms office license curious t read more
4,expected the storyline to focus to delivering more excitement well rounded back story and not drag out two episodes when we all wanted more like the party boat scene and less about the gate character types of throw away story lines give us more dialogue such as the character wishing he would be a thai girl that was brilliant loooking forward to the next white lotus in the canary islands bring back the mafioso gays and their ultra sex scenes and lets find where the heck is tanya is she is some european small island and she surprises us all and she is sober and now a priestess and helps capture greg and the gay mafia
4,this laptop has everything to get a star rating but one of the basic things which a good laptop should have is the battery backup my laptop is just months old and it is not even lasting for hours on a full recharge which is very disappointing i am very much dissatisfied with the battery rest all works brilliantly
4,value for money useful online classes
4,what can i say its an enjoyable show i loved jenna ortega in the lead role as wednesday she matches the vibe of the show perfectly and her line delivery is stellar and of course the viral dance scene was awesome she absolutely crushes the wednesday character i also liked other characters such as thing uncle fester even though he kind of appeared out of nowhere and enid i really liked the set clothes and the lighting too what i didnt like about the show is the bland love triangle between wednesday tyler and xavier the whole idea of a love triangle in the first place just seemed weird for the character of wednesday out of all characters that would be in a love triangle wednesday certainly wouldnt be on there i also didnt love tyler and xavier in general i cant pinpoint exactly why but they were just pretty dry generic and dull to me one thing i also didnt like about the show was the last episode was kinda goofy i wont spoil anything but it was really dumb it felt like they just came up with a bunch of random fantasy stuff for convenience sake and it just comes out of nowhere you will get what i mean when you watch the show overall i enjoyed the show but i wouldnt believe the hype if i were you
4,this skirt fit but is very body con if you are not comfortable with such a tight fit consider sizing up overall the design is beautiful and the fabric is heavy hides bumps i plan on ordering one size up hoping that the waist is not too big
4,the retailer store by me only carried these in the petites but ive learned to always snag a petite just to see because sometimes the petites fit just as well if not better depending on the length of the outfit ______________ pros looks exactly the same in person as online color runs true well made good stitching solid dress great length in the sleeves fits tts im normally a size or and grabbed the p to see how itd fit other than being too short in length on my
4,ordered the navy and aqua in medium the aqua fit a lot tighter than the navy seemed to be a different fabric and less stretchy loved the color on both but returning the the aqua normally wear size
4,these pants are really cute but definitely run small i ordered a large so they would be a little bigger for lounging and they are not very stretchy the large fits more like a small in regular sweatpants there is more blue visible in the top and bottom part of the pants as well which i like
4,this shirt has an incredible softness to it and the purple print is so lovely i did end up returning it simply because the flowiness was a bit too much for me i had tried the and and went with the due to arm restrictions in the smaller size too bad because it really is a lovely top definitely worth a try in store
4,i was looking for something different than the usual cheesy potato casserole followed the recipe as written and was not disappointed tastes great when i make it again i will use the entire lb bag of red potatoes final product was a bit more saucy than id have liked
4,this is longas it is shown in the picture i am five and its actually too long for me it looks a bit matronly on as its just so long i loved the fabricits not heavy and its super soft i think it runs one size big its made very well and as i stated it is a nice fabric with a soft hand it would be nice for a crisp fall day that being said the length just isnt right and does nothing for me im five and slender i definitely do not think a petite woman would like this or be
4,so i can see why this might not be an amazing shirt it runs a little large imo and its long im and its almost to my knees butas a nightgown its amazing super comfy and its now my new favorite pajama dress lol i might wear it as a shirt too but most likely just jammies
4,this product is good for students coding trading like small thing this laptop is perfect for all this types of daily lightuses dnt buy this one for gaming or havy uses
4,i bought this for a swim suit cover up and im very happy with it the fabric is thin and rather sheer i wouldnt buy it to wear it outside as a regular dress im and the front of the dress hits me above the knees the fabric is soft and comfy the blue with white piping is pretty and the fit is flattering im really happy with this dress
4,i doubled the recipe for superbowl threw in some roasted corn and a oz jar of light alfredo sauce made it thicker and creamier
4,i purchased this in my usual small size and it fits just the way it shows in the photo it is very flowy which is th point i wore it over a black romper and it looked great i can also wear with jeans and a simple black tank keep the vest open or use the hook and eye and close it up seeing the black through the sheer white is simply dreamy glad i purchased it during the sale on sale promotion it is a classic piece for sure
4,i love cute summer dresses and this one especially because it is made out of linen is unique it is very wellmade with a design that is quite flattering i am foot and a little curvy with a c bust and i got a size it fits well although it is difficult to zip up because the material has no give the perfect dress to wear to italy or france now i just have to book my tickets
4,i just got done making this for dinner tonight i used italian sausge meat as well with ground beef turned out good
4,the last of us videogame had a good story and great acting it was already very cinematic so i was skeptical about the need to turn it into a tv show unfortunately they missed the mark for a start episodes was not enough not only did they cut corners but they also added content which wasnt in the game the premise of the last of us is ellie being immune to the infection which has nearly destroyed all of humanity but the show fails to show us how the infected have made adventuring outside quarantine zones so dangerous they appear in only episodes of out part of joel an ellies journey is also surviving against the hordes of infected and not just humans there is a middle ground between all out action and nothing at all the casting and characters are good but i dont think bella ramsay was the best choice for ellie nick offerman as bill was fantastic its a shame we never got to see him interact with joel and ellie too little time was spent with henry and sam while kathleen a completely new and useless character was given a backstory and plenty of scenes over episodes david was shown as a villain right away while originally in the game he seemed like a good guy and gained ellies trust there was no need to make him a christian preacher either the most important part of the last of us is the relationship between the main characters joel and ellie are supposed to bond over time and all the key scenes are directly lifted from the game but its so rushed on the show that none of it seems earned the relationship needed to breathe a little and feature more small moments where the of them interact like a father and daughter
4,i was looking for a coat to wear over dresses this one is the perfect length and works over all lengths of dresses and looks awesome with jeans too my only concern is how it will hold up in the rain it hasnt happened yet
4,got for my husband for a change classic lynx deodorant dont use too much the smell can be overpowering but clean smell that last for the day
4,when i saw this top i had to have itruns very small would size up especially if curvy on topsheer but not too sheer feels and looks delicate no problems so far
4,good productbest
4,the performance of the laptop is very good apps open at instant when you click to open it the battery will last for to hour only display is average not so good but if you are student and you have to do coding on it then its diplay will be good for you for entertainment lover display will disappoint liitle bit sound quality and camera are also average overall a good laptop around k
4,this shirt is pretty but wasnt worth the price in my opinion the shirt does a pretty decent job of staying closed at least and the embroidering is pretty but i could tell the material wouldnt last very long also i like my shirts loose fitting but this one looks more boxy than flowy id probably still buy it if it were cheaper
4,chrome os is worst in terms of document editing tasks as everything needs to be done online through google docs slides or sheets many useful android apps are not optimised for this osms office android version can not be found and downloaded from the google play store overall the chromebook is only good for multimedia consumption tabs are much better than these socalled chromebooks
4,it was amazing i started watching and waiting for each episode to see what would happen i was so excited to see what was going to happen in the next episode that i scrolled the mouse as much as i could to see it as soon as possible i loved the actors and honestly im looking forward to the next season because there is no way in any universe that there wont be a sequel to this excellent series i enjoyed everything that kept happening i never found it boring even for second as it is i love the whole series and i really hope that there will actually be a sequel because the income i hope a lot that the actors and others are getting is very well deserved its a terribly good piece of work
4,this is a nice style and pattern but it is quite clingy around the hips so beware if you dont like to reveal too much in that area i do love the tuliplike hem
4,i consider this to be a flattering dress that is a good wardrobe staple since it can be dressed up or down and worn with a variety items ie cropped denim jacket oversized knit cardi leather moto the twisty knot in the front is very cute and slimming and doesnt add bulk to my squishy squarish waist this dress is tts to a bit large the colors and material make this appropriate for autumn through spring my only upset with this dress is the raw edges which cheapens the quality and makes m
4,good i th gen laptop but battery below everage design look like better hp value of money laptop
4,good recipe but use half or no sugar the first time i made it with the sugar the second time with half the sugar still a good recipe with less sugar
4,andor takes the viewer to the darkest depths and highest peaks of what the rebellion truly was within the scope of the star wars universe it made star wars real and palpable the rebellion was shown in the original trilogy to be a group of dogooders saving their galaxy from tyranny but saving the world always comes at a cost and andor shows us what that cost is sacrifice is the the constant theme in any truly noble act and whether it be your comfort your friendships your love or your lifeyou will feel the pain this show is chock full of that and then some ive loved the star wars universe since when my dad took me to see the original trilogy rerelease in theaters and this is to this day the most honest and genuine representation of what george lucas was writing about in the s do yourself a favor and watch this all the way through and i promise you will not be disappointed
4,i purchased the sandisk ultra gb microsdhc for some extra storage room for my samsung galaxy note tablet i was considering the gb but went with this card because i have the gb version on my galaxy note phone and i have never come close to needing all that space granted i dont store any music on my phone but i do take a lot of photosvideos and store as many apps on the microsdhc card rather than use the phones internal memoryfor the cost savings of going with the smaller gb card it was a no brainerthe card has worked flawlessly since i installed it on my tablet and have had no problems with it whatsoever plus sandisk is a big name in storage so again its a no brainer buy it
4,just not my style it is light and the color is lovely and summery but the cut of the sweater just did not work at all for me and it wasnt overly soft though that wouldnt have mattered if it fit me better
4,i found this to fit tts i sometimes wear petite but found the petite sizing to be a little off i have a pretty short torso but found the petite to be too short i opted for the regular sizing and got a it fits great this top is great for work styled with a cardigan or blazer or for play i can see it dressing up or down very easily
4,when i saw the dress online i thought the print was beautiful and fun and was not disappointed when the dress came in the material is very soft breathable and easy to wear i dress it down with a jean jacket or a jean vest but it can easily be worn by itself its definitely a delight go to dress for the weekends
4,if you like westerns star wars and sci fi this is the show for you without giving much away think of it as a boba fett like characterspecies having his own television showcant go wrong with that right after watching the first episode i cant wait to see what disney has to offer for the reminder of the season i see a lot of potential in this series with non stop action this is a must watch for star wars fans the episodes are approximately minutes in length and will be streaming on disney plus the first season will contain episodes airing once a week
4,these cupcakes are easy to make and have a wonderful flavor the cream cheese frosting with added cinnamon is a hit and i will be using it for other cakes like carrot cake the cupcakes tend to collapse and become flat topped instead of the usual cupcake shape however the shape doesnt detract from the flavor my family loved them
4,i love the cut of this dress and im rather short i dont think you need to be tall its a nice light fabric that will work well for warm weather it did wrinkle quite a bit during the day but never looked messy i certainly wouldnt describe it as frumpy it has a nice loose s feel and you can tighten the belt to make it more fitted through the waist the belt is sewn on in the back so you cant take it off without quite a bit of tailoring i had no trouble with the bust being too
4,very nice product im happythank you so much filpkart
4,this is such a cute and unique top the fabric is substantial linen but a little rough i went with my regular size but the straps are a little loose i am thinking of having them altered planning on wearing this with a bandeau perfect for summer
4,pthis is nice and wonderfulp
4,i got this tee for a great price online and i did like it a lot i got it in medium and i might have liked it better if it was just a bit bigger or if the material wasnt quite so clingy i decided it had to go back
4,i tried on the blue in store and ordered the red in petite and they are both too long which means i will have to hem i am not sure if i want to spend the extra money on hemming so hanging on to them for now as i love hte cut and color they fit like a glove otherwise i do have muscular thighs the p is good for me lbs cant go wrong for a nice pant i can see wearing these out or for work
4,i ordered this dress to possibly wear to my wedding rehearsal dinner i an adding this review to give some guidance on sizing i am size a and own two other dresses by this designer in size for this dress however i had to size up to a in order to close the side zip im and the dress hit me just above the knee in my opinion it would have been more elegant if it was a little longer the color combo with the taupe and off white is unique but wasnt particularly flattering on my
4,i wanted to comment about the wash yes these jeans look really dirty when you pull them out of the package but after a few months of washing the dirty color has really mellowed also i am a usual in jeans purchased these in and could have fit into the i may purchase another pair these jeans are really unique comfortable great for the summer with sandals or converse
4,pros light weight and simple design performance due to ssd battery is enough around hours licensed ms office cons power button design sometime you have to press twice build quality is not solid this means you need handle with more care in general a good laptop for home and students use
4,performance best but build quality average
4,the dress is very pretty however the description is deceiving i purchased it not just for the look but because it was listed as silk but that is not exactly true the underslip is silk but the outer dress what you see is definitely not it is a cheap thin material on top skirt is stiff not loose or flowy as the picture would have you think i will keep it very happy i did not pay full price
4,we as parents were more happy to have it than our baby he has it since he was months old and till now he is months old he has no interest on it even he enjoys playing with all the other toys i cant really say that it helped our baby with sleep circle
4,turned out really good i shouldve formed mine better i just dumped it in there so the top was a bit funky d i did halve this recipe my first attempt at making bread and it makes me want to try other recipes really tasty im glad it was a success
4,i am and lbs extremely muscular i ordered a size large and it hangs very nicely over my curves the neckline looks pretty good with my broad shoulder and the dress comes about inches above my knee i think people with curves would really like this dress but it does lack shape so beware if youre looking for something with some structure the blue is gorgeous and the fringe details are very cute this dress does seem to run a bit big
4,st of all i would like to say about the product packageing was good but the flipkart packageing was not so good about product i get this at k but i think i miss the oled screen and laptop getting heat up after _ hrs work but the build quality was good enough overall good product
4,no silly identity politics no attempts at political correctness just a cool character cool sets lots of action amazing special effects some people dont like that the crawl isnt there and the music isnt like other star wars stories but i actually prefer it that way because the mandalorian isnt part of that story it stands on its own even if youve never seen star wars
4,very soft comfy lightweight sweater perfect for layering as the weather gets cooler looks great with jeans or jean shorts
4,jon favreau should be in charge of all future star wars projects its exactly how it should be i will not give stars because nothing is perfect but this is very very close hats off
4,hello i found this plush very interesting for my grandson but we press on the belly and she lights up and breathes only a few seconds
4,this fits great it looks great with jeans or exercise pants a little lighter weight than i hoped but looks great hangs well on my body i bought the white
4,i received the laptop in perfect condition and the packaging was also done well when i checked the warranty it was showing as months remaining i was very disappointed with this at first but then i changed the purchased date and the warranty now shows fine and i do not have any issues with that i am impressed with the product it works smooth for everyday study and office work it has ms office too however the flipkart delivery agent was very rude and was not at all cooperative and he a read more
4,i ordered the copper in a medium which i felt was tts the color is beautiful and i love the buttons on the shoulders which i really didnt notice in the picture the material is also very soft but i have some complaints first i felt that the material while soft was not very substantial for the price i purchased another vest from that store that has everything which was less and seems to be the same quality i also was expecting there to be some way to close the vest beside
4,i have a shorter torso and so i usually love dresses that hit right at my waist so this dress seemed perfect i ordered a size petite which fit very well the regular two in picture was not as well made the straps didnt fit as well they were less of an x and way more fabric petite fit great i think this dress is really fun but not very mature i returned it because it didnt feel adult enough for the event
4,love these pants the colors style fit however this is the second pair of retailer active pants ive ordered that ive discovered had a hole in them these are not cheap pants so the poor quality is inexcusable
4,someone returned my size so i got to try it on in store the cut is very flattering the material is stretchy the lace part is nicely made too overall great piece the petite waist did hit me a little higher than on model i have a regular torso and short legs and overall usually need petite
4,overall is good at this price but battery is slightly weakit drains rapidly
4,millions of dollars spent on terrible writers and horrible directors while all this time their answer was right in front of them making star wars cartoons for the disney channel
4,this is a darling dress it is super flattering except if you are a swimmer and have broad shoulders unfortunately i had to return it because it pulled so tightly across my shoulderschest i ordered a size and it was actually true to size other than failing to accomodate for an athletic upper body im lbs wish i could have kept this one
4,help i have made this twice following the recipe exactly and it falls in the middle each time the cake is delicious but i cant serve it with the sunken middle any suggestions how to solve this problem thanks
4,good priced memory comes in plain white wrapper and an adaptor for sd card size it didnt forget what i put on it so i guess it works
4,i love the overall look and comfort of this piece my only negative is that since it is not lined the folds in the material on the inside are somewhat noticeable especially in the shoulder areas i guess since it is a light color it is more obvious to me but it is not something that would make me return it it is comfortable and looks great on
4,battery life could have been better
4,i picked this up in the store during the retailer weekend sale i used to have a similar long black stretchy skirt that i wore until it fell apart things i really like about this skirt are that its basic black but has some interest in the small swiss dots in the top layer and its stretchy the yogapantwaistband seems like it will be very comfy and also allows you to adjust the skirt length a little bit depending on whetherhow much you fold it down it is lined which is a big plus i was
4,value for money product im edit wedding heavy size video laptop perform very great im happy with this product thank u flipkart
4,get ready for a captivating and thoughtprovoking journey with white lotus on hbo max this exceptional tv show is a mustwatch for anyone looking for something fresh and exciting featuring captivating characters and exceptional acting that will keep you engaged from start to finish what sets white lotus apart is its ability to address complex themes and issues such as privilege class and the dark side of human nature in a nuanced and thoughtprovoking manner the exceptional writing is reflected in the sharp and witty dialogue that adds depth to each character overall white lotus is an outstanding tv show that should not be missed the combination of breathtaking cinematography excellent acting and masterful storytelling makes it one of the best shows currently available with two equally great seasons set in different locations white lotus is a true gem that delivers consistently exceptional quality its an for me and i cant recommend it enough
4,great series great cast save one and great action beth however is what a real female superhero should look like id marry that barren beauty bombshell in a horses heartbeat even fight rip for her my kinda woman antithetical however is the ubiquitous sullen eternally aggrieved full of righteous indignation daughterinlaw a walking cliche with her condescending smarterthanheryears attitude
4,i dont have anything like these pants so was thrilled to purchase the coral i found the pants ran slightly large though i stuck with my regular and they are very comfortable
4,it was exactly the memory card i ordered i tested it using the adapter that came with it by plugging it into my computer worked greati replaced the gb card already in my new tablet a month old with the new gb card and everything ground to a halt waiting a long time made no differencethe maximum card size for my tablet is gb i guess for now its just an ornament thats why it was the unexpected thats why it only got starsupdate the memory card may not be at fault
4,i cannot gauge if its better or faster than a class or i use it in my mobile and it saves pictures just as quickly dont see a difference but it has advertised capacity and works ok
4,i mean i cant stand the main character i dont feel any empathy of her and when that happens i think everything its ruined i hate the situation of innocent people dying because of her and she hasnt ever been close to the wall i hate her close ups too anyone gets them at this time im also hating the rythm of the show seriously everybody walk so slow and the palette of colours uff it turns really hard to appreciate this show it really bother me that refugees has a lot of resources big cars and big houses and it seems that they dont have any job and who is taking care of baby nicole all the time its funny how you find a high punctuation of this show but when you start reading the reviews stars are for the first seasons i say where did the good script go because sometimes at this point season and it seems to me that im watching a parody of the first and i have laugh too to some actions so i wonder if that can really happens when you suppose to be watching people going through a lot of suffering
4,im normally an xl but i bought a l since so many said it was big and boxy the l fit great its tailored to the body but not tightfitting just as shown on the model the detailing at the shoulders is heavy compared to the light knit of the fabric of this tee so it pulls the neckline forward a bit i bought the red and wow its a bright fireengine red thats just stunning it looks lighter in the photo it arrived all squished up in a little tiny roll so it was really wrinkled
4,vfm
4,this top is one of my favorites i cant get over how much i love the design the dots are adorable and i received a ton of compliments the back of the top quite a bit longer and it looks great my only complaint is that it runs a bit small on the top even though the shirt is perfectly sized on me i bent over to slip on my shoe and one of the buttons popped off after less than a minute of wearing it
4,this is really flattering its one of the best purchases ive made through retailer i know it will work with a lot of different body types the medium fit me well i bought a petite version by mistake but it still fits
4,my first time making lasagna i followed the recipe except i used store bought spaghetti sauce my family really enjoyed this dish
4,i read a lot of no way completely unrealistic etc but what if a cult gets the power its not your normal religion they practise in gilead there are a lot of strange fanatics in the world and there seem to be getting more of them that being said hey its fiction drama the idea of a world like that is pretty scary and the way its brought to the screen even more eerie acting is great musical choise at some scenes are somewhat funny but i really believe its meant to be funny since its all dark and terrible allready plot is slow but i dont think its too slow it just adds to the suspense season eps left to go for me is starting off slow but i think its paving the way for a season at least i hope it is
4,it is a pretty tank the fabric feels nice and substantial
4,very good the only thing i would do differently would be to add a rd can of beans
4,this is a charming dress with lots of quality touches and something which is easy to wear and appropriate for many occasions however the dress i received wasnt quite like the dress pictured in the catalog and main website photos the bottom buttons of the overdress do not have matching holes so you cant button it this makes the v lower and the bodice looser it is like the photo with the brunette model on the website rather than the primary photos with the blonde lady personally i w
4,beautiful print and a flattering cut however the proportions are off based on other reviews i ordered a petite i am and dont normally need a petite cut i also ordered a size down even the petite requires that i wear inch wedges and pin the top in the back to keep it in place i am going to take it to a tailor to have the hem shortened and the top sleeves adjustedthen maybe the v neck wont be almost to my belly button
4,everything is working pretty good except a small issue of battery it is a bit faster in discharging but if are running low power consumption softwaresits perfect
4,velue for money
4,this was very easy i used fresh tomatoes and beef broth instead of can tomatoes and the bouillon it felt like maybe something was missing for our tastes so i added garlic and cayenne pepper it was the little extra something we liked in our soup to take it to the next level i will definitely be making it again
4,not long in use until now great the only thing that could be changed is the clasp i find velcro very unfavorable because you might wake up the baby again if you want to switch
4,this cardigan is just the right length ie not too long as so many are these days but the sleeves are ridiculously long will have to shorten them for sure fabric is definitely not heavy pretty color i do like it overall
4,love the shape of this top i bought in white and a friend bought in the neutral pink we both required a tankcami to layer under it i am lbs c curvymuscular frame and ordered a size small
4,i really like the style of this top the open sleeves are subtle i think it is even work appropriate in a business casual environment it is slightly short waisted in my opinion and runs a little small but my usual medium worked for me i am a solid
4,this show has it all everything you could want in a show and the acting is incredible ive never been impressed by a show as i have been with ys once you get hooked you cant stop watching best show ever
4,all are ok bt bettery drain too quick
4,this tunic is very nice flattering good design worn in winter and spring and fits well i have a curvy figure and this fits well i wish it came in more colorsit does show flaws slightly but fits well and is stretchy
4,this top is a lovely combination of rugged and refined and will be versatile wear for a party pared with nice pants and flats to casual with jeans and boots it appears well made though i had to size up for my broad shoulders but other hh tops fit the same way
4,this dress is adorable i plan on wearing it as maid of honor in my sisters wedding next year i am in between a size and usually go with because im a bit busty and have some hips but since i got it after it was put on clearance only a size was availableit turned out to be a perfect fit literally i tried it on braless if i had any sort of padded bra then i would have trouble fitting in the top section which worked out perfectly since the arm holes are a bit low i think it
4,i added this to my samsung s gb phone and it works great i can store most of my music for when i travel i will nevery have to listen to the same thing on a signal trip
4,title says it all im blown away how great theyre telling this story while staying true to the game i just bought the the last of us on ps had it on the ps and ps watching this reminds me of missions that you had to do and tonights ep was too good it was like i was watching myself play the game they couldnt have picked better actors pascal is great in anything but he really captures joel i wasnt sold on bella at first but eps in shes a great ellie i cant wait to see how the rest of the season plays out and i can already see how they are letting joel acquire better weaponsif you never played the game even better
4,my son said that it tasted like my homemade pizza before he knew that there was zucchini in the crust my family liked it i will make it again
4,this was sooo good i pretty much followed the recipe except i did add red pepper and chinese spice i like spicy will definitely make this again
4,nice gaming pc but battery is the biggest issue brand new and still battery holds for max hour with peak performance
4,i think thats the only way to describe the series and even though its called series it just feels like a long movie that despite the length moves relentlessly whatever you want to call it it really doesnt get much better than this the writing was brilliant and kept you furiously engaged from start to finish the mark of tim burton was all over this the writing the acting and of course the visuals that said this thing no pun intended would not be as flawless as it is at least in my book without the extraordinary cast and the absolute brilliant portrayal of wednesday by jenna ortega she was made for this i binged it in two days and im now really bummed that its finished enough said i highly recommend this
4,i am lbs and size fits me perfectly the print is lovely and the fabric has a nice flow to it at this price point the dress should have a lining
4,features are as expected a good one for basic usage but screen quality could have been better its very thin and need to handle it bit carefully
4,after nine years the bbcs flagship drama series comes to an end a genuine cultural touchstone in the uk anyway the show has spawned a thousand licencing agreements dressed and styled hundreds of men and most importantly been a genuinely entertaining series it doesnt perhaps quite join my list of very tiptop shows but it got a lot closer than many manage post the great war a crime syndicate the peaky blinders run birmingham their leader tommy shelby cillian murphy returned from the war a changed man unable to rest his ambition is boundless and through the right deals and the right violence he expands the shelby empire across the country and eventually the world but an empire won through violence can be taken in the same method and even within his family opposition is plentiful i really liked peaky blinders its a very stylish show with modern music mixed against the recreation of the black country in the s the costume work is really strong which is perhaps why aspects of that style have caught on in real life performances are amazing too which youd expect from a central cast who are almost entirely movie stars aside from the main cast tom hardy sam neill anya taylorjoy sam claflin adrien brody noah taylor paddy considine and stephen graham all make appearances along the shows history special word though for the peerless helen mccrory who is glorious as polly but who unfortunately passed away before filming on the final season could be completed i suppose that you might argue that despite the change of location it is essentially just another story of organised crime and the tropes of that genre are present here but rarely are they so expertly delivered i do think that the final season was perhaps a little to maudlin compared to what had come previously but the actual final episode makes up for those failings movie star performers in a lengthy subtle and epic crime story whats not to love
4,pretty goodi found if you make the banana mix and cover it and let it sit overnight the taste of the bananas just really pops frost the next dayalso it is so much easier to mix frosting if you let the butter and cream cheese sat to room temperture after frosting i stick it back in the fridge to set up just a bittook it to a church function and now have to make a copy for someone almost forgot it turned out better when i made it in a x and baked it for about min compared to the x
4,this ia very pretty dress however it is a unique design i like the design of the dress but i can see where some may not i cant see a younger person wearing this it is more for an older woman the dress is so soft does wrinkle easily but just a beautiful pattern and comfortable i can see some of my friends thinking this is too much like a nightgown but i really love this dress
4,beautiful even if arrived with low batteries
4,i purchased this based on previous reviews the quality of the dress and the print is excellent the dress fit me perfect in the front however there were so much extra fabric in the back that it made me look extremely large i understand its a shirt dress however the back would need to be taken in like inches for someone who is looking for a more boxy full coverage dress this is more for them
4,these are nice flattering bra with light to medium suport however the colors and patters are not quite as pictured i almost suspect they are slightly different on each bra exmaple on the picture online the left side seems to be a light blue and the right one orange on the bra i received the left side is a darker bluishgreen color the right side is orange and light purple i would hae prefered the colors on the photo but it is not a big deal i guess i ordered the color block shorts as we
4,this is a lovely dress it is on the heavy side and lined so i would not recommend for hot summer wear but the material and style are adorable the skirt is definitely aline not sheath but i prefer that it runs a tad too tight in the chest so if youre between sizes in the bust id order up that said a would be too big for me im lbs and c and usually wear a
4,dove is such a good brand but this one is one of my favorites shea butter just smells so good and makes your skin feel amazing
4,initial impressions are good just got the laptop today will post an update in future if i face any issues
4,yellowstone is a modern western drama television series that follows the dutton family who own and operate the largest ranch in the united states as they fight to defend their land and way of life against various threats both external and internal the show features a starstudded cast including kevin costner kelly reilly and wes bentley and has been praised for its stunning cinematography and intense action sequences however despite these strengths yellowstone ultimately falls short in several key areas the writing while occasionally clever and poignant often feels formulaic and contrived with characters delivering stilted dialogue and plot twists that feel manufactured and unearned the direction is similarly hitormiss with some episodes featuring exciting and wellexecuted set pieces while others drag on aimlessly or rely on tired genre cliches in terms of performances the cast is generally solid with costner and reilly in particular delivering strong and nuanced portrayals of their characters however some of the supporting players feel underdeveloped or miscast detracting from the overall impact of the show overall while yellowstone has its moments of brilliance it ultimately feels like a missed opportunity to breathe new life into the western genre with more consistent writing direction and performances the show could have been a truly standout piece of television
4,this dress is really beautiful cheerful the color lovely the fabric soft and beautiful i wish it had worked with my body because i really liked the style fabric and color i am with long legs and a shorter upper body so i needed to buy this dress in a petite size but they were sold out of petite smalls and mediums so i tried the small in a regular size the armscye depth of arm hole is so low that my breast was completely revealed i thought about shortening the straps entirely
4,very fast booting i th generation u processor over all good laptop and flipkart packaging are good thankyou
4,very pretty top but like the other reviewers saidthe neck is very itchy i live in florida and i dont think i can wear this during the summer unless i get the neck lined i got an xxs p which was a little shorter than i would have liked so i am returning for xxs
4,the best star wars project ever its literally the star wars that all of us adults who grew up with the original trilogy needed no lousy jokes ruined original characters or cartoonish effects next to the mandalorian this is one of the best star wars in a long time its pure genius from now on i wont look forward to the franchises movies but for the series honestly much better than any movie in the saga i never thought that star wars would become one of my favorite franchises but since ive been watching this series ive become a fan of this universe from now on ill see all star wars projects especially those that are related in some way to andor wow star wars not only needed something like andor from my point of view and that of many others star wars began to be a saga since this series
4,this top is a little big but i sized down and liked it a lot can be casual or can dress it up with a statement necklace perfect fall shirt
4,laptop is very working good but battery back up is drained very fast
4,i love this shirt its a nice simple longsleeved tee with some nice details i especially love the seaming on the front back very flattering
4,if you love the print then this is the dress for you it is so incredibly flattering for hourglass shapes and it has pockets i wanted to keep it but i just did not like the pattern and every guy i showed it to hated the pattern if they had it in a different color i would buy it in every color
4,battery hr gb ram non expandable lifetime ms office super speed
4,im an xl in all retailer tops and sometimes the xl are still too small to fit loosely i dont like to wear tight clothes having said that i had to purchase this top in a size small because it was just cut so large the sleeves hang a bit odd if you dont get the correct size i love the feel of the blouse the fabric is a nice quality i recommend giving it a try but have patience during the process of figuring out the size that will look best on you in this blouse
4,brilliant casting brilliant story and an authentic presentation of the post world war birmingham are just some of the most unique things about the series the accents of the actors as well as the changes in the characters over the seasons is exemplary the show balances humor action and drama in a very masterful fashion all in all a masterpiece
4,i am very satisfied with this product
4,good experienceits better use for office home and good gaming experience go for it
4,these are really cute and done in a substantial knit type fabric that drapes well and doesnt cling i ordered my normal size large so id say theyre true to size the leg isnt too wide and bells out nicely toward the bottom the color variations are striking but on me they made me look wider than i am im short and the hem hit at the top of my ankle instead of the cropped look shown think theyd look best with shorter tops i decided to return but still highly recommend
4,okay so kind of an alternate edgy show definitely a fantastically matched cast delivering a great performance with the material but actually the real genius of mark white is in his hiring of cristobal tapia de veer to create the soundtrack for this show music is phenomenal it is transcendental it is by far the shining star of each and every scene cristobal tapia de veer has the talent to be the john williams of his generation someone please give the man a real bigbudget franchise opportunity never thought id ever say this but im watching this show to experience the music
4,i wear stuff like this a lot so naturally i got this one i love it and i think its flattering however it wrinkles easily and also when i hand washed in cold water it shrunk a little which super irritating but im going to wear it anyway i think it can be worn with many things so itll stay in rotation a while
4,the style and color is very nice but the fabric is a bit stiff the fabric doesnt have much give and isnt as comfortable as most of my other retailer t shirts still a cute top for the cooler weather
4,i am hooked and my boyfriend loves it too we started it without any expectations and looks like it was the right decision although its not to everyones taste its among the greatest recent series if you like strange and satirical humor cringeworthy stories and slowburning plots with layers something new at last both writing and acting are excellent this show is like your first ice cream sundae after a year of dieting with extra whipped cream after the complete netflix nonsense anyone who loves satirical humor will definitely be going to love this series you just need to give it a go and wait one or two episodes to let it sink into your mind
4,i must say the first two episodes of the series were difficult to get through as it us more talking and less action so i do understand the bad ratings but for those who gave up after or episodes those episodes sets up a continuation for the rest of the show which is totally worth it i love everything of it i am seriously blown away by the setting and how they created it beautifully done i also believe that the director used less coloration to give it a bit of a darker look as for writing great job no plot holes and if there are some theyll get filled up in later episodes the were a lot of things that left me questioned but eventually all the pieces of the puzzle will fall in place the acting is great as well i have even more respect for cillian murphy after this show i like how ada shows her feminism although it looks like every woman in this show is stepping up all in all the director did a great job reflecting time and place for this era in history awesome work
4,the laptop is nice from the hardware and the built quality side people are saying that the display quality is not that great yeah its not that great its good just enough for everyday task and if you are that hardcore editor then you probably have a monitor then this laptop is highly recommended because of the specs and the omen built quality and support it give dts software which is direct competitor for dolby they basically are the same thing and you get microsoft officr student life read more
4,a great and reassuring support when falling asleep my child loves her little ottiunfortunately you can notice the music box very clearly a stronger padding would be an advantage herenevertheless i dont want to do without it
4,unlike other reviewers i found these pants to run true to size in my case my usual or even a tad roomy the red pattern is just festive enough for informal holiday parties i appreciate the belt loops
4,enjoyed this very much i left out the italian dressing i just forgot it i think and used small corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas i thought it came out a bit dry so i might add more salsa or some enchilada sauce next time the whole family scarfed it down
4,my kids love this and its a great idea but the motor is noisy which is annoying considering how its kind of expensive i wish they would just go all the way with this lovely thing and take the time to put in a quieter device for the stomach movementmy kids still use it every night and i love the soft lullabies not at all creepy or loud or obnoxious sounding very nice soft music
4,this is a beautiful top the detail in the pattern of the fabric is gorgeous and the color goes great with jeans love the design of arm holes they dont show your bra the only con is price but its a keeper
4,on the hanger this dress looks a bit boxy however once on it has a beautiful flow and elegance to it its super feminine and cinches in at the waist perfectly my one major complaint that prevented me from purchasing the dress theres no give to the dress i wasnt able to lift my arms up past degrees and thats sort of a problem its a shame though because the outside shell is gorgeous and so structured and it would have been a nice contrast to the shape of the dress on a body
4,this top is flowy and feminine the pink is slightly more vivid than pictured online but is still a beautiful soft pink definitely not red i was afraid the shape would be unflattering on my notsoskinny figure but its not its baggy all over and theres plenty of room in the arms note that dark pantsskirts will show through the fabric so i like the shirt better with an untucked camitank top underneath it so the gorgeous neckline isnt disturbed but the pink color runs true throughou
4,best in this price go for it good for gaming
4,four stars only because it didnt seem to turn out quite like the others said probably my fault howeveri will definitely make it again because the husband really enjoyed it and i think i know what i did wrong hopefully alsodidnt change anything
4,this is such a family favorite that i no longer need to read the recipe its a winner
4,very good even i omitted the onion i used milk instead of cream and cans of chicken broth is just a bit tooo much and can is enough for me
4,just go for it from display to proccessor everything is top class comes with gb integrated graphics what do you want more really great at this price point display really amazing quality and excellent experience battery this really feels low gives hrs max on medium work like normal coding etc speakers it also feels low and the speakers are at bottom position so sometimes sounds got low keyboard really amazing quality and comes with back light and quality of the keys are also read more
4,tommy shelby is one of the most brilliant characters ever written the show is absolutely flawless it grips you from episode all the way through to the last episode of every single season everything from the outfits to the cinematography to the plot to the actors to the soundtrack is incredible
4,absolutely brilliant in the star wars vein i would give this more than stars a must for star war fans miss this at your peril
4,deep purple keeps it fall flower design keeps it feminine pockets make it fun love it and cant wait to wear it
4,i love the way this dress feels and falls if you like a formfitting bodice this is not the dress for you but the drape and cut is flattering and comfortable
4,i dont normally like laceup details but for some reason i dont mind it on this top its a bit shorter than it looks on the model and im not especially tall the fabric is nice not too heavy not too lightweight great for fall
4,s episode is nail in this seasons coffin bad acting and weak story lines mixed with cheap filmography lizzo cant carry a line jack black lacked his usual magic now adding mandolorian to the other failed disney star wars spinoffs like boba fett amd andor all suffer bad acting boring story lines and cheap filmography need to cancel my subscription disney doesnt seem to be able to develop new content and may be a reason they keep redoing old movies that were amazing and now they feel they need to redo we need disney to get back to being a creative powerhouse only the parks have magic left
4,good recipe easy quick i added smoked paprika green peppers garlic thyme used velveeta sharp cheddar and cream cheese i didnt make a roux as i didnt want it to thick added some cornstarch and it was perfect topped w bacon i will definitely make this again
4,the last card i got was bad but at least this one is working properly sandisk is the best brand
4,overall very good laptop value for money
4,going to make it
4,nice laptop at this price value for money
4,i initially bought this in the brown in a small but ended up exchanging it for an xs in ivory as other reviewers have said its not the softest sweater youll try on if you want it to lightly hug your body like the way it is on the model you may need to size down while i love the style it feels like the type of material that will get stretched out easily so ive been careful getting it on and off i picked this up during retailer days and got it on sale the quality is of the yarn is just of
4,great dress comfortable to wear and flattering with the stretch cinch waist and the soft flare of the skirt i feel flirty and fun with its open scoop neck and dipping back plenty of space and simplicity to accessorize or not i bought it in blackwhite and red each with its own feel
4,this was a great recipe i think next time i make it i will definitely add more meat spices and soy sauce this recipe is a keeper
4,its fine nothing more nothing less think law and order procedural with more asskicking and death acting direction cinematography script pretty standard exposition driving fighting rinse repeat what really bugs me is toronto being used to pass for nyc this is a very common practice and i get it money is money filming in manhattan is cost prohibitive but even the establishing shots are obviously not new york i mean they cant even be bothered to have some stock footage of the skyline id also be ok with the story just taking place in canada could cause some problems sticking with the source material i guess
4,this chemise is so comfortable and beautiful can be dressed up or down and is a staple of a bohemian wardrobe gave stars for the fact that it is completely see through and requires a not included slip underneath also because the super thin cotton will wear easily
4,gentle with a lovely lather not so keen on this fragrance but would try others in this range
4,figuratively and literally this show is stuck on a hamster wheel of misery and gloom im seasons into the show and i have to say this is not the type of show that rewards you for watching it its designed to be bleak and you dont really start to understand that till half way into season this isnt a tale of uprising and rebellion its a tale of suffering and survival except where most shows or movies are based on true stories that involve those subjects this is based on a fictional story that is mixed in with real life events and histories that being said this show is not going to be for everyone youd be just as right to give it a as you would be to give it a sometimes you watch shows like this and you get so wrapped up in what you dislike about the backdrop it takes place in that you overlook the amazing acting and talent to bring a world like the one the handmaiden lives in to life it really does evoke emotion from the viewer it makes you want to yell at your screen and throw a fist at how bad the world your watching has become you get so upset you keep asking when is someone going to save these people but you know its not going to happen because thats not what this series is about this series is about human survival not trying to change the world or win a war but just surviving the circumstances youve seen this in slave films youve seen it in films about the holocaust youve seen it in just about anything where someone is forced to live a life they never asked for and is trying to just survive through it that is the handmaids tale theres a lot that happens on this show and theres a lot of dialogue this however isnt a show were youre going to have favorite characters because there isnt anyone to root for everyone is in a gray area even some of the handmaidens everyone is acting out on what they need to do to survive weather it be for their own sake or for the ideal of the country theyre building its a very unique show once you begin to understand that it becomes more enjoyable to watch season was rough getting through because youre so used to seeing people in those situations getting rescued or some big rebellion but thats not this series as the show moves on you get to see more of the world and how its changed you get to learn about the strength of gilead and why other countries havent just joined forces to knock them over gilaed is all the strength of america but without the ideals of freedom its just one nation under the liberty of god and by that they govern its a very hard pill to swallow and its on the same level of shock as the statue of liberty scene in planet of the apes but it truly shows what happens when the freedoms that people value the most is gone they live under a religious state where the top is cemented in their wealth and prosperity and everyone else is just there to be used by them there is one flaw of the series i find and that is that there does not seem to be a trade off for what the people of gilead lost these are american citizens that had a civil to defeat american freedom and all they gained was impoverishmentslavery and fear of their masters hand it seems like such an odd trade off that so far the series does not explain
4,i was pleasantly surprised that my card arrived ahead of schedule thats always a plus in my book the works without a hitch i was able to copy the files from my gb card to this one relatively quickly and very easily my samsung galaxy tab read the card perfectly i have no complaints about the card although i expected the write speed to be a little faster after all is said and done i would definitely recommend this card for your tablet smart phone or any other device that allows for expandable memory
4,nice dress fits true to size beautiful mustard yellow and soft corduroy
4,first off companies need to mark these right they consider mb to be gig when gig is actually mbthat means you will end up with gb and in all actuality it will read as gb in your device other then that this card works awesome i would highly recommend itone star lost due to them not knowing how to measure data
4,the fit on this jean is amazing they just run large and then they also stretch quite a bit after wears i am usually a solid size and have other pairs of dls but i am buying in a so i would say one or two sizes down from your usual size
4,i bought the moss which is more of a pretty pastel green they are very nice in that they arent tight yet stylish and i can dress them up the only drawback is that they stretch a lot i can get two wears out of them maybe a rd if not worn for hours and hours or all day each wear im getting the light yellow pilcro hyphen chinos now all the colors of both styles in the store are very nice id like to have each color for reference im and size i would say that they are tts b
4,this is a beautiful dress i bought the red color in petite and love it i know i will wear it a lot and the style is really easy to wear i feel amazing in it even tho my post baby body isnt what it was
4,i purchased this laptop during big billion days where including card offer it went around k in short its a best deal trust me under k everything is balanced and when i say everything means everything and im tech enthusiastic so im telling you its a best laptop for productivity and very light occasional gaming body aluminium dtsx tuned speaker are so good not out of the box so you have to tune it connectivity is very good display is ips but still good for normal work and touch i read more
4,and proof as to why including the original author as consultantcameo when remaking a filmconcept is becoming a must
4,im really excited that retailer is selling basics i love the flow of this fabric and it does not cling i havent worn them yet but theyll be perfect for work i look forward to trying on the other essential styles
4,product is very good but battery performance is very poor
4,very good product my daughter and i are conquered sweet super adorable puppy the sounds and music are great breathing on the belly makes all the difference its very appreciative only flat having to open the scratch to change the music but i recommend
4,reacher started off with a promising stride but quickly descended into a monotonous journey the series in its attempt to craft a gritty atmosphere falls prey to repetitive dialogues and scenarios that sap the vibrancy from the plot phrases like details matter in an investigation assumptions kill and the patronizing have i ever told you youre smart are recycled to the point of exhaustion these overused lines rather than adding depth become grating echoes that detract from the narratives potential the redundancy overshadows the shows merits leaving a viewer like myself disenchanted and reluctant to continue what could have been a gripping tale is diluted into a wearisome loop lacking the innovation and dynamism to keep the audience captivated in its current state i find myself unable to commit to another episode yearning instead for a story that evolves and surprises rather than one that insists on retreading familiar uninspired grounds
4,value for mone
4,i heard rave reviews about the white lotus and to be honest i dont have anything positive to say about it accept its had a brilliant cast each episode is so slow and drawn out ive had to return to this series multiple times and still have episodes to go i keep hearing to stick with it and that it gets better if this show doesnt end on a high ill definitely feel like ive wasted hours of television watching high imdb scores and award winning acting just waiting for something exciting to happen or is that just going to be in the final episode and a massive anti climax
4,the style and material are nice but what i love is that it does not give me a wedgie and i think it would still fold nicely on shorter frames
4,the product is simply awesome though touchpad feedback may be better
4,this top is not quite what i expected but it is good quality and very comfortable looking at the tall willowy model in the pictures i thought the top would be about tunic length and hang straight down in reality the design adds volume to your frame by cutting out in a kind of aline from shoulder to midthigh in fact the shirt is so long and has so much flare that i think if i had ordered the regular size rather than a petite it would actually make a cute dress for reference im a
4,the whole cast is superb the only thing that raised an eyebrow was the casting for gomez lucia played a really good part however the character was tall dark and handsome overall this is a definite watch and also a definite waiting for season tim burton does not direct all of the episodes jenna ortega was simply brilliant casting could not have got this more right she was amazing cannot imagine anyone else that could have played wednesday as well as jenna ortega katherine zeta jones gorgeous as ever and another perfect fit for mortician hope that we see more of her and unclear fester in the next series
4,this is such a fantastic series i have been so disillusioned by recent productions from disney that i thought star wars was simply finished for me this changed that in a profound way the writing is excellent the acting too cinematography atmosphere character building the slow pacing the fact that creative people put the story at the center and built on its strong foundations i just finished the first season and i plan to watch it again very soon im really looking forward to the second season if you liked empire then this is most likely for you do yourself a favor and watch it note it might be a bit dark for younger viewers in my opinion viewers should probably be at least
4,this was a quicker version of shrimp scampi than my usual but was very tasty i add c white wine to the sauce for additional flavor that we enjoy the crumb topping added a pleasant crunch as another reviewed has said take care not to overcook the shrimp i have also doubled the recipe for company and added lb bay scallops for a seafood scampi that is quite good we enjoy the texture of angel hair pasta with our scampi
4,i ordered this in green when it was on sale and was so excited to get it i thought the color would compliment my complexion perfectly i read the other reviews who mentioned this item fit closer to the body than what is shown on the model i wish i would have listened while it is a very comfortable piece and stretches it is a lot tighter than i wanted and because of that it is a bit see through i didnt want to have to wear a cami underneath and i am pretty curvy this top does show many of
4,this laptop is so good if bought around k i am purchase this laptop k such a this bugget good product but windows installation date is jully whenever i bought this product in october so we aware go to offline
4,season season season its the vibes imagery music mood sound design flow i just love this third season so many good characters so many laugh out loud moments for me just from looks and reactions great cast great cameo cant get enough have watched every episode twice and i am looking forward to revisiting in the future too best setting by far for my enjoyment so many more characters i am rooting for and hope for the best for so much possibilities of redemption even if it doesnt transpire i loved the build up of the first four episodes and then the escalations in the final episodes the setting is sublime and i feel i am on an adventure with the characters
4,very moist cake made using a cupcake pan without cupcake papers then and topped with strawberries and ganache using oz of semisweet choc amp cup heavy whip cream melted in pan i then hand dipped each cupcake and served in a cupcake foil looked and tasted awesome
4,reacher played by alan ritchson is not just a character hes an embodiment of simplicity strength and sheer badassery watching this show made me question everything about modern lifefrom social media to my smartphone addiction lee childs creation is so wellbuilt that you cant help but feel inspired to ditch your online presence limit your possessions to the essentials and embrace a life of action over distraction the attention to detail in every scene the relentless pursuit of justice and the understated power of reachers charactereverything is on point alan ritchsons portrayal is nothing short of legendary the mans body is unreal and his ability to perform physical stunts while maintaining an air of cool nonchalance is unmatched he doesnt need to speak much to make an impact and thats something we should all learn from reacher isnt about words its about action and lets not forget the iconic line details matter this show teaches us to notice the little things in life whether its your actions your surroundings or the choices you make every episode is packed with thrills and its impossible to look away i found myself wanting to adopt reachers lifestyleless talking more doing and always always prioritizing what truly matters this is the kind of tv show that can change your mindset and lee childs writing plays a huge role in that
4,overall laptop is great except there is a heating issue
4,i ordered it with a particular outfit in mind as i liked the purple burgundy color ordered xxsp as with most tshirts at retailer they run a little big xxs seems to be my new xs which used to be s color was nice fit was good too i just felt not special enough but if you are looking for a tshirt then i say give it a try as it was comfortable and the shape at least is unusual for reference lbs dd in waist
4,the fabric is really gorgeous and the lining is lovely and soft unfortunately being on the petite short side it just didnt look quite right on me i felt a little swallowed up i wish it had worked because its so lovely
4,beautiful product battery backup average performence good k bought also good
4,really disappointed by morticias acting not her at all could not stand her on screen love you queen jones wednesday is cute as f loved her character but the whole story with the school didnt flow well together if youre gonna do gore do better horror the cgi was goosebumpy but slaughtered the kids overall i think its getting way better of a rating then it really should due to it being tim burton but being tim burton i expect nothing less then creating worlds that dont feel like any other wednesdays universe though dark didnt feel like his world just because i loved ortegas performance
4,the colors and fabric on this dress are really pretty the lace is a soft blue instead of white i have other dresses like this from this brand and really wanted to keep it but it runs larger than the others i have also it doesnt have pockets if it fits you properly i think you will love it
4,good laptop at this price renge battery drain within hr while gaming or hr for normal uses charging speed was great with w super fast charger
4,great battery should running more but ok heat more
4,this is one hell of a leap to live action star wars television the mandalorian delivers in both capturing the feel of the classic trilogy as well as its own unique identity a sweet mixture of both scifi action and comedy many star wars fans have experienced the expertly crafted stories by filoni in series like the clone wars and rebels his influence shines bright in the mandalorian along with john favreau this bring many star wars fans joy at the excitement and wonder it brings all around
4,best laptop for st year btech cse students
4,too much noise from the fan seems like p pc of old era
4,my husband and i thought it was just okay
4,i tried the green one on in the store as my store only had the green the lace was sort of fuzzylooking and i couldnt tell if the items were shopworn or if the lace was supposed to look like that since they all looked that way i decided it was the look of the original fabric and i tried it on i do like the combination of the lace sleeves and vneck a bit dressy but casual also although i sometimes appreciate a little forgiveness in the tummy area in this case the design was too loose a
4,great for lounging or running errands can be dressed up or down i found them to run at least a size large though
4,another beautiful mave piece that is too big waiting for the size down to come in the mail fingers crossed this works the large was too overwhelming on my frame the tank that comes with it is soft and comfy and the gold accents really make this an outstanding number too bad no petite is offered i ordered the black but it was hard to choose because the white also looks amazing i predict lots of cooing over this lovely
4,i love the long tunic with high slits its such a great design i bought this on sale on a whim i did see that there was already a small snag on the one i purchased right after i took it out of the bag must have missed that when i looked at it in the store i still love it just a little worried based on other reviews that i wont be able to keep from snagging in the future at the sale price i would say still worth it though
4,im lbs xs fits surprisingly well the sleeves were rolled up when it arrived so i didnt noticed they were long the wrinkled appearance looks fun and casual the big drawback is that the interior seams poke and scratch my skin when i wore it over a halter top even over a tee it was irritating in one spot despite that love it enough to keep
4,binge watched the whole season after being nothing but disappointed in tfa tlj and tros it was shocking to see that disney could actually produce something star wars related without mucking it up although i did like rogue one and solo was just ok excitement character development and a story worthy of watching along with characters from all of the movies sprinkled in here and there i even liked the subtle humor because it was done correctly and not ridiculously forced like in the films i just hope that they make a wise decision for once and keep the same team together for the next season because this was awesome
4,absolutely love it have called in love with tommy
4,everything is good but it kinda heats up with prolonged use
4,cant remember the last show that had me laughing and crying at the same timeand im a year old man the twists and turns are just amazing there are so many emotional reminders of events in your own life one minute youre thinking one thing the next something completely different its reminds you that everything isnt all black and white in life its not really those big events that matter you need to get over it and move on la vita è bella great acting directing fantastic scenery and cinematography all in all a brilliant show i just wonder how theyre going to top this with season
4,ive read every lee child book and alan is reacher he even brings out what i always thought reacher might be a little bit autistic or has adhd with his kinda single mindedness and lack of empathy whilst killing he looks like what i thought reacher would look like a bit smaller perhaps but built physically like him i just loved it i took my time watching it knowing that i wouldnt be getting anymore episodes for a year or more really cant fault it and i just wanted more
4,good product in budget
4,this was just ok it wasnt bad but i thought it was missing something corn cilantro not sure what i gave it stars because of the ease of the recipe not sure how this recipe wins cookoffs though
4,battery is too goodperformance is quite less if you are looking for high performance better to skip thisfor basic tasks it was perfect
4,tried both colorsgorgeous but kept the white as it offers more versatility in my wardrobe happened to have an retailer cami that follows the lines of this top exactly to help conceal how transparent it is the black color will also need a cami strong sunlight or a camera flash will be revealing a lovely layering piece under sweaters vests jackets so pleased
4,everything is good but the display is slightly low other wise everything is good
4,i love the tealaqua version the colors are very pretty and look great with jeans i got a medium it runs a tiny bit small but a lot of fitted tops at retailer run smaller on me i like the style a lot and the peplum is great
4,ok so this is adorable i am and medium size and had to take this to my alterations people because i loved it so much but it fit awkwardly the back was too long and hung funny on my short body after it was reworked it is the cutest thing i own they also made the little belt tighter across my waist it is super versatile my alterations people ran out and bought themselves one after they saw mine so if you are not a toothpick or tall know it can be amazing with a little attention
4,best value for money product but the battery backup is not good
4,i am writing this review in anticipation of season after being largely entertained by the previous two seasons unlike many other series and movies there are so many to choose from some are good some easily forgettable i keep thinking about this series why is the white lotus so good why would i recommend it to new viewers there are three components that make it so good unique characters portrayed by excellent actors the combination with the beautiful surroundings and the drama that takes place between the characters everything that the beautiful surroundings hide the surprising experiences the unpredictable and partly shocking events in the series are the opposite of boring and predictable the white lotus manages to entertain surprise and shock everything is so well executed acting script direction and the setting the white lotus deliver at a skyhigh level a lot of other things become downfalls after watching this series i hope for much more
4,this show had so much potential i kept looking for something to take a turn for the better i watched all through season episode not gonna lie i really dont like watching shows that are just one long fiery s show and that have me rooting for of the characters to die painful long deaths the duttons and company make the demons in washington seem like desirable citizens
4,this top is great for spring its super light and can be dressed up or down depending on what youre wearing it for fits true to size and is great quality
4,genuinely one of the best shows ive ever watched the cast is absolutely brilliant and the acting is amazing cillian murphy is such an underrated actor and needs so much more recognition hes amazing all of the birmingham black country accents that the actors use are amazing and very realistic its one of the factors that make it so enjoyable the plot and story line in each season is very good and thought out the violence in the show is just the right amount as well the characters are very well written which makes the show so enjoyable the cinematography is out of this world its very detailed and interesting and whoever the camera crew was they did an amazing job on the shots throughout this show and can i just say the soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks ive ever heard it fits the whole shows vibe and it is perfectly placed in scenes to build tension etc i love this show so much and recommend it to anyone who hasnt watched it as it is such a masterpiece
4,super cute dress and very flattering simple fresh and fun
4,this sweater looks alot better in person the picture online doesnt do it justice this can be used both as a sweater or even like a lightweight jacket a very versatile piece added to the wardrobe definitely worth the markdown price only con is that it has some fluffy pieces in the yarn that comes loose on wearing and sticks to other fabric so wearing it with black pants might cause a problem
4,great story with lots of turns and twists to keep you interested hard to stop watching nice work paramount
4,product is very good and love to use this product one like for the company
4,good quality product thank you
4,battery performance is so so other things are value for money
4,i happened to really like this top it does show some back but looked cute with high waisted jeans i happened to like the raw hemline and found it quite comfortable and cute i am lbs c and the size small fit well though i could have gone with a medium for a much looser look
4,this was really cute and fit true to size the only thing i didnt love was the dip on the top left side of the tank near the cleavage i probably shouldnt have been surprised since it actually shows up in the picture on the model but it doesnt lay flat correctly there like the right side either way its still very flattering and cute
4,i keep yeast in the freezer and use as needed im using yeast from my freezer now that is over five years old still very active
4,need to improve battery life and display quality
4,its hard to sell anybody who is not a fan of the genre including me on the idea that a postapocalyptic zombie horror story can be subtle beautiful and magnificent but this is the joy of any science fiction including zombie horrors and yes i know that technically this is not a zombie horror but it is definitely part of that genre so lets move on is that the writers can use extreme situations to explore the edges of human existence and emotion raising and answering the great what if questions of how we might react live learn and love in the most testing and unfamiliar of circumstances the last of us is a genuinely great example its largely episodic structure dives deep into the situations of various characters that our protagonists ellie and joel encounter along their journey this is also a road story every episode is both beautiful and tragic as we see the real love that drives people to survive in what are ultimately hopeless and doomed circumstances episode in particular is really moving while barely advancing the main plot its a character study of course the first audience for the last of us will be fans of the game and their expectations will be more than met this is a nearperfect realisation most of the sets situations and characters from the game are instantly recognisable and true to their source without in any way compromising the quality of the television experience both the broadest vistas and most claustrophobic and intense experiences are brought vividly to life unusually for an adaptation of a game it doesnt matter a jot if you have played it the show will stand entirely on its own and if you didnt know it was a game adaptation you probably wouldnt guess even the rare good examples of other game adaptations usually show their roots much more of course it helps hugely that the last of us was so loved and respected as a game precisely for the strength of its story and characters for all the credit due to the games creators the writers of the adaptation the director and others behind the scenes even more must go to pedro pascal and bella ramsay they are both perfect in these roles ramsay has extraordinary depth and lightness of touch and a huge career ahead of her pedro pascal is of course already well known but it still amazes me he went almost completely under the radar until about years ago game of thrones narcos etc do watch this its excellent yes its gory and scary at times sometimes intensely so but its the human stories that will really stay with you
4,i thought the flavor of this soup was very good i will make again but next time i will cut the water by cup i thought soup was too thin
4,this vest is soft flattering and versatile but both pockets were sewn incorrectly with broken seams on the bottoms so if you used them things would fall out im keeping it but had to pay a seamstress to fix it for the price id expect better quality recommended conditionally
4,this is perhaps my favorite addition to star wars lore since the old republic sagas in knights of the old republic games the characters are interesting the story is thrilling the fights are exciting the filming is excellent the music is amazing the goosebumps that episode gave me is not what ive grown to accept is the new norm from disney which is anything from okay to utterly disappointing the story built up from episode never left me hanging but yet somehow paid off unexpectedly well im so happy with this series i hope it keeps on giving
4,very cute shirt but the white is see through i could see every detail on my bra i returned for the pink which is just as cute
4,i like everything suitable for babies
4,very subtle my preference but lovely fragrance no lingering perfume creamy lather doesnt dry my hands docked a star as only bottle not pump is recyclable if they offered bottles without the pump so you could reuse the pump
4,cute sweater but dont plan on wearing this until at least fall i love the look of this and the quality of the knit is there but this sweater runs large and its heavy i normally wear an xl in most retailer topssweaters but i could probably wear a m in this sweater i for sure need the petite size because this xl regular came to my knees and fit me like a coat i ordered this online but am going to try and exchange it for a smaller size at the store otherwise ill have to return it
4,laptop is good with nice design also with a great control centre with several options built quality is good nice performance in gaming at medium settings
4,i love love this top and bought it in both colors it runs a tad big but fits me well both l and xl fit me well but the xl was longer so i have one in each size i really like this top it looks good goes well with most pants especially blue and is very comfortable i am very happy with my purchase
4,i purchased this dress in blue and paired it with the seychelles forward platform wedges in cognac the fit is amazing the length is great im and it hits me a couple inches above the knee and it is a great spring staple my only issue with this dress is that is wrinkles so easily easily fixed with a quick steam or low iron
4,lovely feel to this almostcowl neck turtleneck its quite thin and has length sleeves so it wont keep you warm but the fabric is soft the ribbing is flattering and the fit is loose without feeling frumpy overall a good staple thats a bit more interesting the mauveish color looks great with grays
4,i got this to wear as a beach coverup over bathing suits if you purchased a darker color and were small chested ie you could go braless since a bra wont work well with the low back and armholes you might be able to pull this off as a very casual dress i bought this in a xs in the coralpeach im lbs dd and its not super seethrough but id never be comfortable wearing it as a dress on its own as a beach coverup its cute and comfortable but as a dress it would be
4,the performance of the laptop is very good multitasking also work very smoothly in this and some people say that games like free fire and battleground do not play well in it but it run very well when when in low graphics and its battery is in will give a star because the company has claimed hours while its battery last in normally use build quality display if the display was antiglare it would have been very nice trackpad and keyboard
4,its not them its me so sad ordered two sizes r and p nothing about them worked for me i loved the colors blue and green i loved the fabric heavy washed soft cotton i loved the style ah but there is the rub i am so small that the width of the legs just swallowed me up whereas the s fit around the waist and the length while longer than id have liked was doable there was just so much fabric around my skinny legs i felt as though i was wearing huge balloons on each leg t
4,running good
4,its awesome yarr dont think just buy it best for student for studying jeeneetcollege purpose etc it it enough
4,jenna just hits hard in this seriesall the cast members has done their job nicely emma myers as enid played a nice role in this show and unlike the addams family movie the gothic creativity of tim burton just made it much more mysterius fun to watch this series and it gives me wibes of harry potter talking about wednesday everything is black and white whether it was outfitthoughts as a ravensmartwitty and kind a scary mentioned in the series and enidher roomate plays a opposite role very colourful and adorable although she is a werewolf but played a crucial role in this seriesand in the end it is very good series
4,great sweater very pretty and warm i would say it fits true to size but the fit itselfstyle is just a little roomier just like on the model i usually take an xs and the xs fit great the tag says to dry clean or hand wash in cold i always wash my wool sweaters in cold water in a garment bag on delicate wash and have never had a problem but when i did that for this sweater it shrunk to a size that would fit a year old the fabric in the arms stuck together like velcro very inter
4,well i totally disagree with the previous reviewer on this one i think this top is very pretty yes it does hide any flaws in the tummy but it is not wide nor does it make you look pregnant side or front view i am ft inches broad shouldered c and the small fit nicely i usually wear a small to medium in retailer tops i am thinking of purchasing the xs as there is still plenty of room around the chestarm area the lace is pretty looks good worn with a dark colored pant the only
4,this tunic is comfortable and casual it is as pictured and flattering the two materials make it flattering i ordered the white and it is see through it really does need a camisole which i found a little distracting given the fact that it is already layered i which i had ordered another color because it is cute
4,this shirt is so cute very casual looks and fits exactly like the model and a basic retailer fit around the waist
4,i never write reviews but i just purchased this top at full price last week in the store its not a have to have top just to look at it but once i put it on i had to have it its extremely comfortable and i am able to wear it while running around with my boys and still feel as though im put together ive worn this top now times and after the nd wear i have holes in the area where the waist line of my jeans sits the first time i wore this top it was for only and hour or so what a
4,this skirt is very stretchy and a nice soft thickish fabric the pattern is also very cute i ordered the xs p and it fit just right length was pretty much as pictured just at or slightly below the knee the opening in front was also as shown a bit wide not a slit but shaped like a thin arc overall i still recommended it it rusn pretty true to size lbs in waist
4,how dare you call this monstrosity the witcher its an insult to all the fans of the universe what kind of scam is it what happened to the good characters why are they lame whiny and pathetic or worse cruel heartless and insensitive im not falling for it they are all totally different in the original youve ruined it ridiculous ideas glued together with some saliva the only thing left of the original are character names and goegraphical names i mean it nothing else if you read the books or played the games steer clear of whatever this is
4,i really loved the colors in this dress and was looking for a long sleeve dress this style may just be big fitting but the sleeves were way too long and the dress was just shapeless on me i usually wear a small or a size in clothing and the size small in this dress was way too big the xsmall may have been a better fit but this dress was on backorder and i just received it right before we are going on a trip theres no time to order the xsmall but maybe i can look at it again when we retu
4,love everything about the dress my only issue is when i washed it cold water and hand wash cycle is shrank about a half a size i only washed the inner slip portion and let it air dry as well so its fits a little snug but fortunately the outer part is very flowy so it doesnt look too tight
4,i have many ponchos i think they are timeless fun and sophisticated and this one is definitely a nice addition to my wardrobe as many have mentioned the center of the poncho is off center however this does not detract from the beautiful pattern on this item i will enjoy wearing it with a tee or tank underneath this winter and fall great purchase
4,another great dress by retailer ive worn it with tall boots with heels riding boots and bootiesall look really good ive also added a creambeige cardigan and even a fuzzyfurry vest very versatile the only few things that i would have liked even more is that design of the dress be actual stitching and not just a flat print and also the material does shrink a tat when you wash it its a staple and keeper
4,the performance is unmatched i mean helios is better but u get hp branding m i right the arrival time was delayed times so star for that as ridder never even picked up the call but about the performance its a monster i have played miles morales ghost of tsushima cyber punktekkan and the performance even at the max settings was fabulous the only other good thing can be hz screen with srgb so if u r getting this laptop under k its a steal anything less is a sure bu read more
4,beautiful sweater very delicate fabric unique design but it runs very small i usually wear a m but ordered a large based on the previous review hoping that would do the trick the sizing along with being long waisted isnt a good combination unfortunately im returning the sweater
4,worked as advertized loads fast only problem was pulling it out of the adapter after loading it on my computer
4,i loved the multi stripe pattern buttons pockets and aline shape i agree it runs small i sized up from my normal size to size it sits at my belly button which i like i can tuck in a thin shirt comfortably the pockets kind of sagpooch forward and dont lie straight through the course of the day but not enough to really bother me i straighten the skirt by pulling up great buy on sale im
4,dress is beautiful in person light material that is excellent for summer this dress is not forgiving in the chest so ladies if you bigger chested i suggest going up a size or two im lbs and ddd i usually wear or this dress in a made my look like i was wearing an unflattering sports bra
4,this is more like the novels than the two tom cruise films reacher is protrayed as in the books foot and stands out wherever he goes something that im afraid tom cruise cant do excellent series roll on the next one
4,i cannot think of anything that i dislike about this series the cast the acting the writing just about everything is absolutely great
4,this card is fast and cheap i used it on my canon s camera to shoot raw format pictures and video and it worked flawlessly im currently using it on my old mytouch phone for storagegreat product great price
4,i was impressed with the textured knit of this piece which looked nicer in person than online and the open neckline with a contrasting stripe i really liked that the whole bodice was lined with a sewnin lining from neck to hem minus the sleeves i would have loved the dress overall but my usual size small was snug at the hips and it would have just made me too selfconscious for that reason sadly i have to return mine but i would certainly recommend the style for someone with slim hips
4,i saw this dress online and purchased to see how it felt on i love the material and its quality it did run a little big i usually wear a medium in most retailer clothing but sized down per other reviews the dress is beautiful and look forward to wearing through fall and winter but just wish it tapered a little more from the waist down
4,this is a beautiful tunic the colors are vibrant and the stitching is high quality please note that the insets on the sides are not actual stitching but a print it is still very pretty please size down a size i am usually a large wearing a or if something runs tight across the bust i ordered a large and it is a bit big under the arms but too big through the waist area i am not small in this area eitheri would recommend buying this tunic
4,what can i say sandisk has the micro sd figured out works with asus memo pad hd movies for long trips
4,love this top and every top tiny puts out runs very small i normally wear an xs but i got a m in this top so pretty and great detail
4,season is the worst case of bait and switch i have seen in a long time with a plotline that is incoherent bad acting and new leading character this is shaping up to be a disappointing season if this trend continues my family and i wont be watching next season and maybe even the end of this season i dont understand why they didnt decide to make a bokatan spin off other than they just didnt know how to continue the grogu and din story a huge copout and even bigger waste of time that seems to be the trend for disney and all things related to star wars andor bad batch and obiwan were all underwhelming and mandalorian is no different
4,i ordered the xl in the green motif the shirt is fitted through the body im a pearshape so its tight around my hips its cut straight down ill need to wear this tucked in or belt itpull it up a bit closer to my waistline so its more comfortable the colors pattern in the green motif are prettier in person i love orange roses havent found any shirt or dress with orange roses before so i kept it i used my birthday discount to splurge on this i think its overpriced for what it i
4,this product is very much thanks to flipkart
4,very nice design and color beige however i am athletic and i thought the petite small was a bit too short even for this cut and just a bit too tight in the upper arms when wearing over a lightweight long sleeve dress may work well over sleeveless will see if a regular small fits better but then the sleeves will be too long and not easily hemmed like the petite sleeves can be the fabric is a bit felty for a boiled wool but not a deal breaker
4,after using it for couple of weeks i am sure it is an capable laptop l have played apex legends in this laptop it runs smoothly with moderate heat it is absolutely valuable for money i issue though sound is not loud enough if you are using it for entertainment purposes then look for an external speaker
4,love the look beautiful color great length but with many of retailers lace skirts dresses and shirts the zipper did not eat to cooperate
4,i seriously wanted to cry when this dress didnt fit me i knew ordering it that it was a long shot im a d and strapless rarely works this was no different the dress ran true to size and it is precious
4,this dress has a great design and fits very well and looks great although the material is not cheap it is very warm and doesnt breath very well which is good in the winter the only complaint i have is there was a small snag in it but i was able to fix it my self
4,so to the customer who are looking for reviews on this particular product there is a fingerprint sensor on laptop performance wise it is quite fast also without power on sometimes we can see jitter built quality is good camera not so good but ok not for core gaming but still works pretty well display is great like enough bright great refresh rate lastly battery will give around to hours with average usagenot with games if you are looking for balanced laptop like can run heav read more
4,its an sd card this ones fast the read and write speeds are pretty equal on this one approaching mbits per second for read and write i installed linux to this drive for my cubieboard yeah read and write speed would definitely be an ultimate determiner of over all system performance with this credit card sized computersandisk makes nice stuff dont they
4,precious tee washes well runs large
4,i love mexican dishes and it is often difficult to find ones that my wife will tolerate the cilantro and the subtle flavor of the dressing made this a meal that she will most likely let me make again a dollop of sour cream would have probably made it even better
4,wednesday is a feelgood breathoffreshair wonderful little delight which is entirely and absolutely fantastically even full of woe jenna ortegas wednesday addams is a sullenfaced antisocial and witchily woeful treasure to whom they should simply hand over all the awards now and she has been admirably supported by rest of the cast including hunter doohan tyler emma myers enid jamie mcshane sheriff galpin joy sunday bianca and the forever lovely catherine zetajones morticia addams the story writing direction and cinematography are all excellent and remarkably consistent across the eightepisode first season simply put the wait for the second season to release will be long indeed
4,otti is top the only thing that disturbs easily is the noise when the belly goes up and down and the inside part is very large otti should be better fed that he is not so hard
4,made these today using stevia baking blend and egg substitute made a halfrecipebaked for minutes but probably shouldcould have left them in for another will do that next timedid not make the frosting drizzle and dont need to these have a really nice flavor we wouldnt want it to be too sweet
4,love westerns this is a modern day look at the way of life in montana every actor is perfect casted
4,theres not much to add to what reviewers have said beautiful flowing lightweight fabric flattering cut gorgeous ombre tone with feminine embroidery a great shirt for hanging out of dressing up this is one of those shirts you expect from retailer you wouldnt find it anywhere else ive had this shirt a couple of months now and have to note that even with careful treatment some of the embroidery is coming loose its gotten to the point that i want save it for special occasions rather t
4,i never got into the game of thrones hype started watching a few episodes this year but it has a slow vibe to it and it has so many seasons thats one of the reasons why it lost my interest very quickly but then i saw the trailer on netflix of the witcher and it got my attention i am now watching the last episode its very easy to watch it is a must see when you like adventure and fantasy tv seriesmovies it is thrilling very good production exciting storylines but you really have to pay attention to understand it all henry cavill is very talented and his acting skills in this series are superb i didnt expect it to be so good out of and i cant wait for season
4,after reading the reviews i ordered an xs and a s in this though i usually wear an xs in bordeaux i kept the xs to me the sleeves and shoulders run small while the rest of the shirt is flowy through the torso i prefer more fitted shirts but decided this one looked ok at the hem hit at my hip i did not find it scratchy at all in the pink with a nude bra it is not terribly seethrough but with a black bra it is i washed it in a lingerie bag and laid it flat to dry maybe it s
4,i tried this on today because when i touched it it was irresistibly soft i like the orange it was a loud orangeand i almost would have preferred some sort of design to it i did not purchase this because at the end of the day it did not suit my styleit was very plain i think you could dress it up with the addition of a belt or the right necklace but i am not usually a fan of buying pieces that do not stand on their own and require an accessory that said it was very comfortable and soft
4,i like pc fast work
4,i ordered this in the white in my usual size and these were too big on me lbs the pants bunched up unattractively around my thighs because they were not formfitting i am hoping to exchange for the size because i prefer a tighter fit the style of the pants were very cute i like the side slit detail and the cropped look im hoping these pants work out for me in the smaller size
4,the acting in this series is incredible the directing and cinematography some of the best in the history of tv bbc and netflix british shows are by far the most elite and the actors are some of the best although cillian murphy is irish this man goes down in my book as one of my top favorite male actors maybe number his character is calm and quiet hes demure and introverted his demeanor is so attractive he is an absolutely beautiful man i love him he is the only one who could ever play thomas shelby i love the beginning first few seasons the most the last season was heartbreaking after aunt pollly died and finding out she had cancer and died before they could finish it was just so gut wrenching to feel the deep pain that shelby went through he portrayed this very well
4,pilcro runs one size smaller this year i compared with pants that i ordered last year and sure enough one inch difference in waist i did not notice difference in other dimensions of this garment so my best guess is that pilcro decided to make tighter waist due to some complaints last year about waist being too lose i personally prefer sporty silhouette and am not thrilled with this change but pants fit and are nice color and quality so they stay however i am not sure i would order th
4,this top has a nice print and material being a full figure it helps when a material stays put instead of being too flowy not very keen about the straps theyre a bit longer for me so they dont stay on my shoulders ill keep it and adjust the straps
4,i really liked the fit and feel of these pants except the bottom of the pant leg was more bell shaped than i wanted bought white pilcro culottes last year and they werent like this but it wasnt a deal breaker when i got home i tried to pair the chocolate pants with something to wear in the summer but it wasnt working for me i think the color was just too dark and fallfeeling they do run big so id think about sizing down definitely worth giving them a try if youre okay with the
4,love this kimono it is so versatile it is a one size only so it might be a bit volumnous for some people
4,this is super cute i bought it in the gray and white lace in a size s and its quite roomy i probably could have sized down to an xs but i like the relaxed look there are a few edges of lace that are not sewn down all the way and i will have to fix them as i can see them start to pull away and eventually unravel but otherwise its a beautiful and unique top
4,i bought this sweater in the lovely lilac and black the sweater is a typical cotton weave in the front with more of a tshirt material on the back the drape is lovely after a quick iron swingy with a flirty neckline my middle us still recovering from baby and this does a nice job of covering the bump interestingly i think they went overboard on the fabric and pleats and i could easily have down sized from a large wear size to a medium
4,most reviews are focused on reacher actually matching his description in the book and alan ritchson is quite good in the role but willa fitzgerald who comes across as both winsome and tough as a deputy sometimes steals the show dimples and a southern drawl help cant argue that the show is great but it is entertaining and one of the few new series ive bingewatched
4,ok received this in the mail yesterday and tried on this morning i ordered the size snd it is really big i notice that the armhole sag and there is a lot of extra room everywhere i am a d on the top so that is why i ordered the size but i will return this and order the size and i hope that will take care of the sagging arm area
4,everything is awesomebut the charging adapter become hot like lava photo taken during windows updating to win
4,used johnsonville hot italian sausage and closer to oz spinach all three of my kids said theyd have liked it to have had more tortellini overall very good though
4,performance is good in budget and the design is also very good but the battery life is not so good display brightness and sound output is also low but if you can consider the cons then overall its a good combo in budget
4,andor is unlike any star wars piece of media with its grounded tone made possible only by being free from any involvement with the force or lightsabers almost every single character that we meet has depth as a result of the excellent writing and casting for this show how could anyone find characters such as syril or luthen boring i would say this is a must watch for any star wars fan even someone who has not seen anything from the franchise will enjoy it i truly believe that in future years will be seen as one of the best scifi shows on television and i hope that star wars listens to the fans and produces more shows like this
4,windows better perfomance
4,new tv series streaming from amazon my wife and i watched two episodes on each of four successive nights sort of like movie nights this is not high art the writing has lots of humor in real life reacher couldnt get away with everything depicted but it is a very entertaining series especially for those of us who enjoy seeing a smart mildmannered wellspoken welltrained big tough guy put the bad guys in their places some simple thugs some unruly prison inmates some dirty cops ritchson is a r real good pick for the role in an interview he said he gained pounds for the role
4,ive been wanting to add some cords to my wardrobe and had to give these a try i ordered the blue color online in size im somewhat inbetween size and in jeans right now so i thought id be on the safe side and go up i ended up keeping these and im happy with my purchase although i do feel like the cut of the leggings is a bit off for me i am a proportional hourglass shape and i found these leggings to be quite snug in the thigh while being oversized in the waist in the end
4,i purchased this laptop in this price this is good laptop for students because they provide ms office and you also download tally epr but i think laptop is slow this is the negative point but all over is good for study purpose not for gaming hr battery backup good performance
4,this dress is exactly what i was looking for for fall events can be dressed up or down flowy suedelike fabric i normally wear a small in most retailer pieces and even though i am pregnant in my first trimester i bought a small in this since it is stretchy and will fit me at different stages
4,my local retailer store didnt have this item in stock so i ordered it online maybe its my perception of color but in the photo the top block of color seems to be more of a muted bluepurple while in person the color is navy and the other stripes are far bolder than the muted colors of the photo i still really like the look overall even though i usually go for more neutral tones and it running a little large made the sleeves of the size small long enough for my frame so i may end up k
4,awesome in this price battery life is goodthis laptop best for students
4,works fine with photo shooting and video recording in eos camera with the sd adapter perfect for tablet and phone memory
4,this is a very good banana bread i did not change anything except did not use any frosting or sauce loved it
4,so far so good
4,this is value for money product for those who started learning laptop good for beginners n for you young kids also functions are more over the same as laptop
4,slight scent keeps going for hours doesnt mark clothes
4,havent used it yet its my first encounter with a micro appears to be a quality product though instructions for using the adapter would be welcomed good cost and fulfillment expecting it to function as advertised based on sandisks track record at our house
4,the only relatable character in this show is daddario i couldnt care less what happens to anyone else you have the bratty highschoolers the mom who supports hillary clinton the dad who worries way too much the spoiled husband the weird manager and the list goes on the other problem with this show is that the plot doesnt move forward at the beginning we see that someone was murdered at the resort which brings up a whole bunch of questions and leads into what should be a great first episode instead you have people sitting around and talking for the entire time maybe the show will progress in later episodes but its obvious they are trying to milk the plot which is funny since this is a miniseries also you are greeted by some old dudes hairy balls in this episode as well overall a pretty boring and unrelatable show i will not be watching further
4,value for money laptop
4,this show its perfection ive read all the star reviews and i dont agree with most of them they all say how the show is sloppy and the lines are bad let me give you a run down wednesday gets expelled goes to a new school she doesnt like finds out there s a murderer loose and gets obsesed over that love interest is the murderer woohooo i liked the show i honestly didnt expect it to be the love interest idk why since it was kind of obvious at the start jenna carries the show alot personally my favorite character was thing a hand can somehow convey emotions i also particularly liked the actor of ajax i understand why the star reviews are frustrated with the show a well portrayed character with the same storyline for like years gets a whole new personality but for me i havent watched the s wednesday show i watched the addams family though but you have to remember she is in the show she was like in the s show and about or something in the s show i personally disliked gomez no offense but he does not look like the old gomez i dont see it his acting is a bit sloppy and badly delivered i like the fact they brought back the og wednesday christina ricci her acting was well delivered overall i enjoyed the show and i rewatched it more times than i can remember i cant wait for season but im not a fan of the whole xavier and wednesday thing i hope they dont make a love triangle again but instead of tyler its xavier what im trying to say is that i wouldntve liked the show without the new wednesday before you get mad just know in my opinion if your gonna remake a showmovie thats been portrayed before theres no point if you do it with the same concept
4,i like it good product next time i will order the bigger memory i will recomend this product to my friends
4,this is my th pair of rockets theyve become my hands down favorite cut from citizens for curvy girls these are the perfect skinny jeans they come up high enough to tuck everything in no muffins top they shape and lift my butt which i need because ive got a generous one they hold their shape amazingly well and dont require a wash with every wear in order to regain their shape they truly have been the holy grail of jeans for me with all that said these are not a star version of
4,i love the little otterworked well to help baby sleep but after months with minimal use the belly stopped working and the music would play for about seconds and shut off i love the music though and it will still play by pressing the play button in the back
4,my best laptop hp thanks faipcart
4,for those who are thinking about performance of intel n be assured that this is a th gen processor and performs at par with intel i gen laptop processors so i would say pretty good day to day tasks like browsing and media consumption are a breeze i could also do light photoshop and illustrator on this thanks to the mhz ddr ram build quality is good although everything is plastic but that is expected at this price point no squeaking or poorly aligned panels one gripe i read more
4,great show great actors and great series the story is great and the characters are so good
4,gorgeous colors and great shape for a mini dress stunning on the only con is how low the back goes a bra alone underneath is not possible will need to wear with a finer shirt underneath
4,like another reviewer said this was too baggy up top the bottom length was good but arm holes were big and top was just too large im lbs and got xs returned
4,this is more a sweater than a sweatshirt but it also feels more casual like a sweatshirt i put it on and immediately felt comfortable its stylish but not frumpy and it will work for me running around town doing errands or going out for a casual lunch or dinner its a perfect weight sweater to throw on in the cool cali evenings
4,absolutely loved it
4,people are saying this is the best star wars since the original trilogy the reality is if we take away nostalgia and sentiment and as a forty something life long star wars nut this could be even better the way the brutal rise of the empire is depicted paints the original trilogy in particular episode iv in a whole new light the destruction of the death star was the end of a rebellion struggle we only now get to understand in this beatifully shot series of story telling at its finest the acting the characters the holeless plot the tension the score everything makes this perfect and a seamless transition into the brilliant rogue one and onwards one day i will sit down and watch both series of andor rogue one and the original trilogy back to back to back to back that is star wars
4,nearly half the show is done and nothing is interesting yet no cool locations action scenes nothing just lots of long dialogue trying to sound smart episodes and the only action weve seen is a shootout in the third episode the characters are dull and talk like theyre just reading lines from the script in monotonous british accents dont even remember the names of the band of rebels just sad cassian the main guy himself is boring and has a cliche backstory of being a tribal fighting the empirereally thats the best they could come up with cmon no imagination the sad part is that this had a lot of potential to be great watching the birth of the rebellion couldve been interesting if it actually had interesting characters
4,based on a couple of newspaper reviews i was really worried that this was going to be the usual made for tv pablum that is often just pushed out fast and cheap and rarely does any justice to the books i hated hated hated the travesty made of reacher by the tom cruise movies this show is true to the books and reachers character is it perfect no but its good and entertaining if you like the book series there is always the problem of representing reachers inner dialogues which are a big part of his character but maybe theyll figure that out
4,i will tell you about a english séries called peaky blinders it was released on bbc two in then on netflix as of now seasons and épisodes of the series as available the leading characters are a gang of birmingham cillan murphy as thomas shelby helen mccrory as polly grey and paul anderson who plays the role of arthur shelby the brother of thomas shelby in the series the story is about a criminal family nicknamed peaky blinders in the series the peaky blinders practice extortion protection and alcohol smuggling its a very emotionnal series in my opinion this series is recommended i recommend this series to you because there is a lot of unespected turns peaky blinders just grabb you ans make you addicted i love the realizations and the actors they interpret well i like when there a fight in the series im sure this series will be a hit
4,excellent well worth the cost of the seafood
4,very good modified with turkey and added a can of italian diced tomatoes only drawback is that its a lot of prep time
4,i didnt have to try to like peaky blinders everything about it felt like a revolution in tv drama i think i even compared it to the sopranos id heard the criticisms of the gratuitous indiesoundtracked slow motion shots and mumbled breathy dialogue but brushed them off before long id bought the first season dvd boxset and sprouted a s military haircut unfortunately the sheen and style of the series wears off eventually about halfway through season i suddenly became aware of the complete absence of any kind of compelling narrative evidently things happened but by now the monotone delivery and haircuts felt like they had nowhere to go i read an interview with the writer steven knight in which he boasted about how hed already got nearly a dozen seasons written and could reel off a script in an afternoon well great work if you can get it but a stark contrast to the yearlong teamwriting process behind a single season of breaking bad where breaking bad creates a narrative worthy of a russian novel and the sopranos shows profound insight into the human condition an episode of peaky blinders feels like minutes of hastily scrawled script padded out with brooding shots of people smoking in dark rooms walking in slow motion and generally loving the smell of their own farts over a onedimensional selection of s and s indie in fact its astonishing to me that an episode of the sopranos and peaky blinders run to about the same length as where each episode of the sopranos feels like a selfcontained movie an episode of peaky blinders has less script than the average jayz video all in all a huge missed opportunity a show that gets so much right but fails to look beyond its own style for anything resembling a story or character development
4,so its nice
4,very good product its battery even lasted more than my st relation loved the product the graphics it shows in games is mesmerizing like my exs eyes the body this product has is too sleek but heavy also overall great product
4,i remember watching the trailer for this on instagram and having no idea what it was about that said watching this show has been my greatest surprise all year the writing and direction in this show is superb awfully funny and wickedly smart they really picked the perfect cast everyone is perfect in their roles and the characters are all so believable very excited to see where this show ends and absolutely expecting this one to be nominated for several awards kudos to the cast and crew you guys knocked this out the park
4,best laptop value of money but flipkart is delivered is bad days waiting for this laptop but still is worth
4,i love the colors the material the design details especially the white pattern at the end of the sleeves the sweater is super soft and cosy i got it in s because i wanted it to be nicely fitted i am on tops between s and m i am of tall narrow build and athletic which means i have well developed but still slim muscles in my chest arms and shoulders to accomadate that i often need m even though the rest of me is an s anyhow i was a bit surprised in s the sweater fits very snug i

4,nice light refreshing cake my husband does not have a sweet tooth so he appreciated this cake the most he cant stand super sweet buttercream type frostings the mixture of pudding pineapple and whipped topping was perfect the cake was much more spongey than most cakes which made it come out of the pan without any problems at all i think i overmixed it because there were very few discernible bits of mandarin orange in it next time ill mix it less for sure thanks for this lovely alternative to the heavier sweeter quick desserts
4,product is too good in my personal experience
4,only problem is you cant upgrade ram other wise best in i segment
4,other than the battery life the product is excellent in terms of built quality and software experience the audio output and screen quality along with the viewing angle is also very good
4,except heating issue other all things are good i urge zebronics to get firmware update to overcome heating issue
4,this velvet tshirt is perfect for the holidays i usually wear a size top or a l but i ordered up and got a size xl it is very tight around my chest c and armpits and the vneck sometimes spreads apart a lot if i move my arms around a lot but other than that it looks great just runs small if you are a size or larger i dont think that this will fit
4,i love these pants the color is great the style is comfortable and easy but can be dressed up like other reviewers i washed these according to the care instructions and they shrunk horribly however after some googling i was able to find a fix soak the pants for minutes in warm water mixed with tsp hair conditioner gently wring them out and start to gently stretch the fabric as much as possible hang on a drying rack and continue to gently stretch the fabric as the pants dry
4,very sweet great sounds but a bit clunky i would still buy again the baby is still in the belly and listen to the gentle music from the inside
4,part if you bake them a bit longer than recommended the crust holds up better in bar form i often bake them mins at home never had a burnt crust the convection ovens at the bakery were definitely faster if they come out with softer crust just cut into smaller bite size pieces or eat with fork the batter is very thick fist time i made i i though i did something wrong you can easily alter the amount of sugar to your liking change up the filings extracts and nuts or other addins as you choose its pretty forgiving its kinda bad hard to mess up this recipe underbaking is usually the biggest issue as is not using enough filling at a bakery you cant skimp on fillings customers dont like that if you do add the drizzle on top it will make the bars a bit wet it the sit out all day bakery tip for dryer drizzle use less milk it should be very thick as in not a drizzle at all but kinda toothpaste like then heat in microwave no more than seconds at a time gets super hot very fast once hot drizzle quickly as it will hardenget crusty very quickly once it drys on the bars it wont make them overly soft works great and you can remix remaining crusted drizzle with few drops of liquid and reheat if it gets too difficult to work with i burned myself a few times with the hot mix so be careful not to overheat it
4,this is a great casual skirt for summer color pairs well with many tops
4,this is a really pretty top the beadingrivet detail is really cool and it feels comfortable on i think the lining is really silky and the lace feels gentle not stiff the top is kind of like a swing top there is a lot of fabric but it is just right the fabric looks rich and lovely great top
4,value for money laptop at this price u didnt get better with the present available options
4,i ran across a video on youtube where costner approaches some tourists on his land prior to this i didnt know this show existed as i typically avoid tv shows like the plague while the acting from costner reilly hauser and huston is solid the writing and general directing leave a lot to be desired this thing moves like a soap opera without being of interest too much here annoys me and beyond the writing and general direction of the show coming in second in the annoyance department is the character kayce and his annoyingly present son throughout season one in its entirety nearly nothing happens that isnt contrived and thats just how the show feels one silly episode synopsis read something about john duttons secret which is brought up as a concern regarding elections by a governor to a ag candidate which is not john dutton its utterly absurd and thats this show absurd driving with your son have a gun in the glove and see a strange van on the side of the road well of course you go full vigilante with your little irritating son present and of course this character is a seal cliche stick a fork in it given the option of watching more of this or staring at my ceiling i choose the ceiling
4,i grew up loving the adams family so i was looking forward to this show since it was first announced and man did it deliver the cast was perfectly chosen ricci is hard to forget as wednesday but ortega was made for that role her dark sarcasm hits every single time i especially loved that they casted a latina since the adams are hispanic in the first place the show was just so much fun wednesdays growth through the episodes was such a blast to witness she is hilarious honestly props to the writers and directors and literally everyone involved because this was an absolute hit i liked it so much that the silly cgi can be easily overlooked i can see this show and this version of wednesday becoming huge i recommend everyone watch this you wont regret it the bad reviews are from people who are stuck in the past youre allowed to enjoy a remake without it taking away from the originals if anything this adds more to the past characters we loved give it a chance
4,beautiful fit love the style fabric somewhat thin but didnt bother me thought a little expensive however but im keeping
4,i love the idea of this shirt the embroidered pattern is fun and summery the fit of the shirt is a little strange i saw that in other reviews but i had to see for myself it is rather boxy i think i may keep it though i will look cute with super fitted skinny jeans to balance out the boxiness of the top
4,i love the look of this bra but unfortunately it is pretty skimpy and sheer i need a little more padding to define my shape and i wish it had modesty padding this wasnt for me so i returned it
4,battery backup is low it is ok for a gaming laptop of this capacity performance is topnotch no other laptop can match the performance no heating like it is in the intel h series go for ryzen over intel the display is good speakers are good enough
4,looks great with skinny jeans or even white pants i have wider hips usually an or on bottom and narrower shoulders small or medium on top i bought the medium and probably should have sized down to the small as this was a little large on me but the top still looked good being oversized i am a b and did not have any issues with button gap my only negative is that the material wrinkles easily the floral detail on both the pocket and the sleeves is a nice touch
4,it was a very deliciooous recipe alot better than i thought it would be
4,i made these into mini loaves i used cinnamon chips and less sugar instead of raisins and walnuts very easy to make
4,cute top a little less fitted than i was expecting
4,this is yummy
4,i bought this top after seeing it featured on a style blog i was really excited to wear it until i realized how see thru it was i had to put a cami underneath which detracted from the beauty of the top even my flesh toned bra showed thru so i sadly had to return it
4,the colors of this top are my favorite part i want to hold onto summer for as long as possible and this time lets me do that
4,why is this not being shown on the major channel at prime time not only is it beautifully shot the cinematic shots draw you into the lifes of the characters putting you on a personal level with them i was left felling disappointed every time it finished and eager for the next episode murphy delivers a fantastic performance as if he was made for the roll not to mention really suiting the period clothing the tension in the story line had me on the edge of my seat i so wanted a happy ending please make another series loved ever second of every episode this will stick in my mind as friends in the north has for years to come brilliant
4,a very pretty pair of overtheknee socks i purchased the dark grey color which has a metallic silver thread running through it a nice subtle but glitzy touch the knitted pattern is intricate and nicely done im and they do come up well above the knee if you are walking quite a bit they dont stay above the knee but they do seem to stay just below the knee because the yarn is fairly thin they dont look bunchy even if they come down a bit i have very sensitive skin and metallics
4,unfortunately i started the season at about p m each episode felt like it was minutes long thats how captivating it was now im bleary eyed having binged all or however many there were great castiing mind blowing twists some violence but it was scene dependent and for the most part those hurt deserved it yes there were victims innicents caught up in a bad situation think john wick without his own dog reacher is the kind of guy who has a relative killed but still taked the time to step in if he sees a woman being abused or a dog with no water then goes out of his way to check on the dog while watching out for violent thugs if the second season is closemy new favorite series you will love it
4,alan ritchson is perfect for this and i love that he read all novels in preparation for his role the soundtrack is great acting is smooth so is the writing and the action is brutal awesomeness im surprised the top few reviews arent higher reacher deserves so much praise i love this series its very well made and continuously worth watching
4,soft cozy and the heathered offwhitepalest gray is a great cooltoned neutral the only surprise was that it is lightweight not nearly as warm as it looks the hood has a fuzzy sherpa lining the unlined jacket has a soft fleece or flannel finish on the inside with zigzag seams the ouside looks like a sweatshirt it does work great as a top layer though polyester cotton rayon got this in a size s to fit my hips and it works out great im currently ish wi
4,i purchased this skirt on supersale but im hesitant to keep it its not poorly made just not as sturdy as i would expect a skirt of its price that said its cute and comfortable i wish it came in numbered sizes because the m is snug but i expect the l would be too big has a good amount of stretch shows underwear lines love the style
4,to good performance
4,almost perfect this jacket doesnt have that weird vegan smell its soft smooth and very high quality this jacket is also a nice surprise for us busty ladies im a ddd and the m fit nicely no squishing as the other reviewers have said the chest has room i got the gray and i loved it its soft tint i returned it because the lower band of the jacket sits right at my widest part of my torso my postbaby belly the jacket is sort of short like a peplum and i want to hide the st
4,i love this tank it is casual and comfortable but has the little scarf attached to it so sweet and styling i tried on the xs regular and would need petite it was a bit long on me but some people may prefer that i also wonder about getting xxs only because it is a looserfit tank both colors are nice and neutral good piece to add to a transition wardrobe lbs dd in waist
4,ive read many of the reviews good bad and indifferent just to see where peoples heads were at i didnt know and dont care that moss is a scientologist i dont care that when the book was written and now its being shown with some th century technology what i care about is the story line with the world we live in today i dont see this happening but the fact that it could the fact that someone thought of this world these woman are baby making slaves marthas dont have to deal with the brutality of being a handmaid i think the cast is awesome even the ones i dont like the storyline the cliffhanger from season to season episode season was freaking excellent if you havent watched it yet youre totally missing out im glad its not on netflix bec i literally would have binged watched it and then i would be lost until the next season i have something to look forward to every week i hope you read this and watch it the show isnt for everyone but it has the drama the love story the villains the weird characters the bloodshed the ups and downs better than a lot of shows on today it has it all dont believe me watch it for yourself
4,for this priceokgor for it
4,i ordered a size xl in ivory its prettier in person there are great details it shrunk a bit after washing and airdrying i cut off the layer of chiffon around the neckline to make it more comfortable a cute summer tank
4,very good even though i didnt reread how to make this i just tossed everything in with the butter dah cooked for minutes perfect
4,i am enjoying the bleak aspect of wednesday having recently binged the original addams family series its a delightful reboot its like a harry potter reboot with a snapehermione hybrid as the lead after episode i hope it continues in the same style and doesnt descend into the usual conspiracy theory cia mission mishmash to which most promising shows resort to keep new series struggling along long after the fresh and exciting flavour that captivated you in series has soured in your mouth i wish the makers of wednesday well and hope they dont fall for the easy stereotyped endless unoriginal and uninteresting arc that drives viewers away
4,this was a really nice soft lightweight sweater perfect for transitioning into fall i found it to be a tad boxy and while i love a highlo hem it was a little short in the front for my liking im still debating if im keeping it since i bought it full price but the color was really pretty and on sale i would def go for it for reference i got a large since i normally like my clothes more loose
4,very good quality but do not open power point excel etc
4,first of allplease stop casting people who are close to thirty to play high school and college roles joy sunday looks and sounds more like a teacher than a student long hair on guys and bangs cant cover up the true age of these actors with that being said i miss the humor the addams family truly brought us this is like wednesday addams goes to hogwarts she was more fun as a morbid kid than one with some sort of power entertaining yes but nothing like the dark humor i grew up with as a young kid the original addams family taught how to think of the irony of what the characters were saying i guess with tim burtons touch i was expecting more
4,i have many left of center tees and this one is a part of that same family i got the deep purple kind of an eggplant color which is perfect for fall the sleeves are long the cotton is thick and i love the small details at the neckline and bottom hem its not quite stars for me though because it is very high on the sidesnot too much that you can see skin while standing still but enough if you raise your arms not a deal breaker for me though
4,product is very good battery life up to hours
4,season one review a series with jenna ortega as wednesday addams and directed by tim burton could be something spectacular but personally it was not as spectacular as i expected i wasnt sure where the series was going to go and it turned out that it was the typical teen show about teenagers solving mysteries which has fed me up these types of shows abound nowadays i was wondering if jenna ortega and tim burton can save this show and they did since everything i liked has to do with them jenna ortegas performance is the best the series has to offer its not complex at all but she knows how to play wednesday and without being expressive its seen that she enjoys the character but the other charactersthe other addamas are fine no they shine a lot but they do it well all the others without forgetting them and something clitches tim burtons style is present i love the settings among other things but the problem is that they do not shine at all they do not have moments where these details are noticed and they simply remain as something in the background the addams are weird in each of their versions but in this one they almost always just say theyre weird but they almost never show it i would have liked them not to show it anymore and that the addams shine more than just wednesday as a last complaint the cgi is terrible enjoyed the series but was hoping for something slightly better
4,perfect for home
4,what an incredible show its a mystery technically but is amazing satire and dark comedy people that complain that the characters are annoying are completely missing the joy of the show the characters are meant to be insufferableflawed mike white is a genius the plots are very layered and i love seeing all the different characters interact and overlap amazing character development sets and cinematography brilliant casting in both seasons very eclectic casts love this show its the best and i cant wait for every sunday and feel like im part of a cultural movement recommended watching for everyone
4,first of all i would like to say that i have never played the games and therefore cannot make any comparisons but that was not a problem at all you can understand the series completely even if you have not played the games the first thing that caught my eye were the incredibly beautiful and detailed sets even though you can clearly see here and there that some things were done with a the computer that does not take away from the atmosphere of the series at all the other thing that struck me as very positive was how natural the relationships and dialogues felt the relationship between elli and joel in particular felt more real than i have rarely seen in a series the acting was also good i already knew pedro pascal and therefore expected him to do well which he did without question i had not heard of bella ramsey before so i did not know what to expect but her performance really blew me away she did her role damn well and i am convinced that she has a successful future in acting ahead of her
4,i cannot believe how good this is for a teenage tv show loved it after waiting a while to see something different on netflix this comes along although i didnt think to much of it in the first seconds it started to surprise me i loved the angelica hustonraul giulia adams couple a lot but the new ones exceeded my expectations actors great plot great settings awesome the movie was actually filmed in romania and looks amazing it has the goth it has the drama it has the mystery and of course it has the magic give it a chance when you can it is completely worth it go go burton
4,i think that each episode is very well made and a great experience in itself but the story in general felt a little bit rushed to me each episode jumps from point a to point b to point c and so on but with nothing in between it was supposed to be a very long journey but it felt kind of fast to me other than that i think the show was really good a must watch ive seen a lot of people complaining that it was different from the game but i really liked that they went much deeper and did a great job in developing the characters and bringing other characters as well i actually felt that they could go even further and generate their own story and i hope they do that in the second season
4,i am very happy with this laptop there is no problem to carry it anywhere and it is very easy to operate it would have been better if it was given windows system but still android system is also very good in this laptop

4,we tried this recently as i have a surplus of zucchini my boys loved them i had no problem with the frosting as is make sure you let it actually get down to lukewarm if you are having problems with the consistency setting it in a pan of cool water can speed the process i baked mine for min for the first then the second as i found them a little dry

4,this top is really pretty i think i will be happy when i pull it out in the spring to wear it the only complaint is that the front is very sheer you have to wear an under shirt of some kind
4,its been to days using this laptop first of all the designs of the laptop are fabulous and talking about the performance i have gb version its performance is good i havent tested any game or something in it but i can say that its performance is of top notch because of the processor i gen h now the very dissappointing point of this laptop is its battery backup its very less it only gives a backup of to hour which is ok as compared to gaming laptop at last i would say read more
4,super cute but a bit harder than i was expecting this was due to the mechanism inside but not as cozy and cuddly as my daughter wanted
4,cute blouse great price

4,on the hanger this looks like a great lbd on me not quite the bell shape of this dress made it appear that i was carrying extra weight in the middle for reference i tried a p and im and a
4,good conditions
4,everything is good except the battery its a small capacity of whr for someone who uses alldayyou end up charging multiple times
4,works great in my modern phone and tablet however i was unable to use it on my pcs sd card reader it appears the older card readers are not compatible with class as both my new cards could not be written to without the operating system win reporting write errorsi probably should blame the card reader but it never failed me until trying to write to this card
4,im a size xl and im busty so my review might not apply to everyone i really wanted this jacket to work however it did not i tried this jacket on in my usual size xl and it was nowhere near the correct size this jacket runs small i dont see how anyone with a bust is going to be able to button this jacket the jacket is not lined and it is very fitted so putting the jacket on and taking it off will require a very thin shirt to be worn underneath the style of the jacket is very
4,tommy shelby is all i gotta say this show is an amazing show
4,cute staple in classic style overall fabric weight is good will be able to get by with nude bra many wardrobe options with this staple
4,this is the best thing disney has done with the property could it be better sure but at least were on the right path
4,this is a much more efficient computer than the rated price this is a must buy walker laptop is an amazing machine thanks
4,it could just be my phone a galaxy s but i have this microsd card in my phone and a gb microcenter version in my wifes phone and the th version benchmarks faster than this card not by much but it is slightly faster again this could just be my phone one thing i do have a problem with is the fit of the microsd card in the holderadapter it is a very tight fit if i put the card in a different holderadapter it slides in and out with out problem the one it came with really holds onto the card
4,i use in last month it a good products desine battery performance sound its have fingerprint senser
4,i am a so i ordered the s slipped these pants on and i couldnt get them zipped up i thought perhaps i ordered a nope a s im not even sure a m would fit these unfortunately are going back tomorrow the material and color were beautiful bronze but the sizing is very strange
4,very good the only change i made was to cook the dumplings uncovered over low heat minutes then cover and cook minutes longer as instructions on my biscuit mix instructed this makes sure the dumplings are done and tender it also thickens the sauce a bit
4,initially when i inserted the card into the samsung galaxy s it recognized it but it wasnt able to format it correctly after doing some research i found a free program easeus partition master that will format the card into fat since windows no longer allows you to do it by default after formatting it into fat the phone recognized the card and it works great now i hope this helps anyone else that might run into this problem
4,so i am guilty of changing my score from to a after finishing the entire first season i had previously rated the show a after watching the first two episodes as those were quite possibly the best pilot and follow up episodes ive seen since breaking bad the walking dead or ozark in my mind i always like to think of films as being scored out of rather than and if i had those options i would likely score this between an and the first couple episodes lived up to the hype and i completely understand why the reviews exploded however after that the show looses some of that momentum which led to people calling it over rated for a while it was holding steady at a and rightfully so the current score if i think suits it much better where things went wrong is that they devoted two full legth episodes to flashbacks which did nothing or very little to progress the story and found themselves playing catchup in order to tell the whole story in episodes which constituted and entire game now i have not played the game but if you actually add up the runtimes of all the episodes youll notice that they actually spent a little over a full quarter of the first season to these two episodes you dont have to play the game to know that when you waste that much screen time on filler youre going to be rushing to finish off the story with of a seasons runtime episode has me in a lovehate situation the episode contained on its own was splendid the acting could not have been better and it was very interesting to see a preppers take on a post apocalyptic situation where things crashed and burned is that it was a complete derailment from the momentum the first two episodes built up and it progressed the story none i think they should have either kept one of the characters alive to fit them into later parts of the story or added another minutes or so of runtime and released it as a movie sometime between season and in order to fill the very long gap that were now faced with this way they would not have left viewers scratching their heads and wondering why they just watched a minute filler episode so early in the season and it would have avoided all the unnecessary debate and flame wars between people who didnt want to see two latemiddle aged and hairy men lock beards in a homoerotic love story which takes place in a zombie apocalypse and those who were enthralled in the wokeness of it and praising the show for doing it i mean the acting and story was good enough for the box offices by far and it it seems like it would have just made so much more sense lastly i know there was a lot of controversy when bella ramsey was cast as ellie because she has a completely different look about her than the video game version of ellie i will say that i can understand peoples surprise and hesitance given the totally different demeanours of and types of characters that bella has played before but also that she did a great job this season i had no problems with her acting at all and it seems that she has won over more than a few skeptics alike now the first season has ellie as a young teenager and if the show follows the game there will be some considerable time thats passed since leaving off in the story and ellie will have grown into an adult in her s and has developed into somewhat of a lara croft tomb raiderlike character who is as gorgeous as she is lethal and bad ass honestly i think i will have a hard time seeing bella play that type of role as effectively as she played young ellie it will certainly be a first for her and legitimate questions about miscasting may come seeping back into the conversation as a result so to conclude i would say that it was a little bit over rated and the criticisms of the show were completely valid and skepticism of casting was understandable but overall the season was a great run and has me eagerly awaiting the next as to what it brings lets hope that things hold up and we get a good follow up but that the show runners learn from the mistakes made in season less filler less rushing and for the love of humanity more zombies
4,love the nautical vibe perfect for summer wear the knit top with cap sleeves is easy to wear and not clingy for those with limps and bumps the asymmetrical skirt has a flare which again makes this dress easy and comfortable to wear im usually a size and the medium fit my hourglass shape perfectly
4,nice laptop with affordable price
4,under budget good product
4,value for money product you can use for havy load also greate gaming experience in this price range lenevo gives always best in low price
4,lite weight good performance keyboard keys are arranged upwords that may allow some chances to enter into key pits
4,i found this during the tag sale this year great classic hacking jacket that still feels modern thanks to the cut a bit shorter and bright metallic buttons i got it in a light grey which will work well with many outfits heads up to curvy short waisted girls this blazer really worked well for me due the shorter length and great waist placement really flattering it does seem to run a bit small particularly in the sleeves and shoulders so i sized up which also allows for layering underneat
4,very yummy i made this recipe from the cookbook and didnt see these reviews online until after making it so i used the squeezable container of smuckers sundae topping cookbook recipe doesnt specify the topping in a jar turned out with a gooey caramel layer under the pecans on top of the cheesecake instead of at the bottom like the picture shows and like they say will happen if you use the correct product it was still yummy im only giving it four stars though because i wasnt blown away and because of the confusion
4,its a good product under kits display is the most impressable part of it offcource you can buy it without and doubt
4,good in this price
4,its just amazing the amount of storage you can get in the size of a pinky nail i have this mounted to my phone filled with music documents pictures and all of my mobile phone records and messages from the past phones still have plenty of room left and no issues
4,in general if you were a fan of the turtleneck swing dress youll love the overall fit tts and fabric of this the patternscolors are also great my issue was the armholesthey are a bit too large and the opening comes a little too far forward which makes it a little unflattering in the underarm area i may reconsider when it goes on sale but its a pass for now
4,i purchased this top on sale and its almost perfect the pleats under the rib cage make the bottom bell out a little bit not enough to make me want to return it but im glad i didnt pay full price
4,what temp and time would you use for x cake or is it x sounds great
4,excellent acting fasinating characters that are all different interesting and a life of their own plot is great with twists and turns that keeps viewere anxious for next episode always has subtle but intriging cliff hanging episode endings never ever boring and cant wait for next episode all actors seem to be made for their particular roles especially costner keepem comin one of my favorite tv series
4,its a wonderful product i like its value for money the first time flipkart has a great value
4,i bought this vest to add more versatility to my wardrobe i love it i got it in navy and since it is one color it goes with a lot of different things tanks long sleeves short sleeves pantsskirts etc i like the bow in the back and the vest makes a plain outfit look much more elegant and exciting the vest itself is a little longer than i would have liked
4,after purchasing three of these one for myself and two for gifts to others i read reviews that said they sometimes just quit and its difficult or impossible to recover data i have only been using my own card for weeks but it hasnt failed yet after having this in my phone for almost months the phone started chirping every few seconds telling me it was either mounting or unmounting a card the sandisk ultra gb microsdhc class uhs memory card apparently just decided to fail thank goodness i only had info for one small app on it and only need to access it about once a week so its not real critical thanks to amazons day return policy though i will probably just have to eat the cost of this one unfortunately i read the other bad reviews about this product after i had already purchased mine of them but my wifes hasnt failed yet my advice is to stay clear of this product and maybe sandisk in general
4,this sweater was cute and comfy and was true to size
4,this is a very unique piece it seems to be easy to wear and it is very comfy but i normally wear a mediumsize and it was too big i might size down to a petite medium of just go for small it seems this might be a trial and error type of outfit
4,i love my this productso i am happy
4,these jeans fit great but i think getting the right size is key i bought my usual denim size and at first i thought they were too tight but as the day wore on they softened and conformed to my body and fit like a glove if i bought them in a larger size im afraid theyd bag out like jeans tend to do i think its the legging style that makes them so form fitting i wish they were ankle length like on the model but im and they are quite a bit longer on me than the model
4,i really want to love this shirt but the small is just way too big on me for reference im a d which is why i didnt want to size down much more than a small and and im drowning in this im going to try it with different bottoms and ultimately will keep it because i do love the quality just size down a couple of sizes
4,best in this price range
4,this lovely skirt absolutely hits the mark for quality it is a substantial weight for fall a deep vivid blue color and just the right length to wear with boots it was a trifle snug in the waist i would have kept it anyway but the oversized pockets stuck out on either side in an awkward way at this price it just wasnt right for me
4,i recently found out that i am sensitive to gluten and wanted to make a banana bread after reading the reviews i decided to make this one and it was pretty good the only changes i made to the recipe was i used cup of brown sugar instead of cup of white sugar and i used pecans instead of walnuts it wasnt the best banana bread ive had but it was pretty good im going to make it one more time following the recipe exactly and see if it comes out better
4,good recipe but on day you need to serve the rest or freeze it chicken only tastes good for max of days
4,nice and quick access very faster start
4,i ordered this jacket thinking it would look good with so many of my current outfits im usually between a small and medium in jackets so taking the advise of the other reviewers i went with a medium while it fit in the arms just fine the torso was tight i couldnt even zip it up i guess i should have gone with a large after mulling it over i decided to just return instead of exchanging i felt the jacket had a much harder edge to it than my style is i was very impressed with the qu
4,this was a great recipe to use up zucchini i would make this again
4,this is fantastic perfect for anyone who is either familiar with the games or books or has never met any of the characters before as i hadnt at the time when i first watched it henry cavill is absolutely fantastic showcasing how good an actor he is and how diverse his different roles can be if anything is confusing at the start give it a chance for the rest of the season and you will be rewarded highly recommended for everyone
4,good productgot at good price so no complaints
4,my rating is entirely for the first season because it truly deserves it i believe it was an innovative series that masterfully delivers sharp awkward humor the conflicts in the first season were between guests and staff all somehow interconnected and very well written season already starts to force these conflicts maybe trying to replicate the success of the first but it doesnt come close and season dont even get me started zero humor zero emotion zero storytelling completely senseless if youre thinking about watching the series just watch the first season and thats it i was honestly surprised to find out that all three seasons were written and directed by the same person mike white it feels like the first season was a result of a creative exercise carefully crafted with time and intention the other two on the other hand come across as rushed productions made just to capitalize on the shows initial success
4,i bought the red motif for my summer wardrobe ill be on the road for most of the month of august and wanted to create a super comfortable capsule wardrobe that would launder without ironing this top is well made super soft and works well with jeans capris skirts and leggings due to its longer length over my posterior i should have read the other reviews first though this is a tad large and i needed to us invisible tape to keep everything from hanging out the front i ordered a medium a
4,i didnt really like how season was mostly centered around cure i mean i love her but i felt like it was mostly about her and other characters didnt really get to shine i wanted to see more of geralts story and him fighting more monsters but most of the time he spent babysitting cite i love my girl yennefer but i felt like she did not really get her moment in season as she did in season it was all mostly centered on cire but it was still a good show i just wish other characters could have shined more
4,what a great sweater the pale pink is sweet but the grey was more my style im c and the xs is perfect i know everyone is saying this sweater runs large but i believe this style is meant to be a bit oversized so i would call it true to size with that in mind the arms are long the shape is boxy but not short and i love the way it hangs on my thin frame its super soft cozy will easily be a goto sweater this fall
4,good laptop performance great display a bit mesh overall great
4,the battery lasts about hours on balanced mode the display is awesome watching content quality is good max tb ssd available microsoft lifetime free speakers are good for a room not evo certified thunderbolt port not available metal build looks premium and slim type c charger no heating problem using it for casual office work and content watching
4,very good ive been looking for really good recipes that i can use repeatedly and this makes the cut very versatile easy to change up the ingredients with good results
4,this product is good in price range
4,this is a beautiful dress considering it is made from polyester that being said the material has a nice finish and looks like it could be silk its a flattering cut other than being a tad shortwaisted and hangs well it was also a bit tight through the bust unfortunately if you are on the taller side it tends to be high waisted and short in lengthmy daughter is and a size the medium fit best although because of the length she is reluctantly returning it sad because it ha
4,i was unsure about the color when i got it in the mail but it is very flattering it is roomy for sure with a pair of slim shorts or pants it looks great though creasing may be an issue ft lbs dthe xs looks good with room to spare nice weight fabric for fall
4,such a fantastic show just love it not many westerns around nowadays sadly but this is just great love all the characters just disappointed that there are many native american actresses out there yet you used chow to be your head indian woman the acting is powerful and the story lines put me on the edge of my seat great work keep going looking forward to season sadly they dont show westerns here in australia so i have to order from amazon when its finally on dvdmakes me so mad
4,good series eh love cillian so much
4,i like the pointelle feature in the front i end up wearing a lot of black but this at least gives me the option to do a bit of color underneath if i so chose ive worn this with white black and blue jeans w boots looks great im and lbs i got a medium but i could have possibly gone with a small my only complaint is that it might be a tad bit too long since im on the shorter size i cant imagine it would be too much of an issue for others
4,the series is too predictable tomas shelby might have done a good job but for my personal taste his character was undeveloped he kept making opposing decisions in similar situations i just cannot understand why is everyone so attracted to this series for me it is really boring with undeveloped characters and poor storyline
4,this arrived just in time for the winter snow storm i was glad i had read previous reviews advising that it ran large and that the gray sleeves are surprisingly attached to the sweater and do not represent a separate top beneath the sweater i got a size small and it fits perfectly its big and boxy but doesnt make feel like i look fat with slimfitting trousers its super stylish
4,cake is absolutely awesome prepared according to recipe without modification no issues with batter running over cake pans although one pan came close suggest using deep pans cook time was minutes frosting is a separate subject although it turned out without issues was not runny or grainy and did not have strong flour or shortening tastes i will not make it again the only positive thing i can say about it was that it was not a terribly sweet frosting which i liked i did not like all the fat and hydrogenated oils and will look elsewhere for a frosting recipe to compliment this outstanding cake
4,with this card i picked up for amazons black friday sale i increased my gniis storage to gb it transfers data at about mb readwrite which is well below advertised however this is very similar to the speed that my gniis built in storage transfers data at so when running large applications off of this sd card i see no difference in speed than running apps off of the phone itself
4,this was a hit in our house i followed the recipe exactly but next time i would double the amount of meat and half the amount of potatoes but even as is everyone enjoyed it and the leftovers got eaten the next day for lunch
4,these wide cut stretchy demon trousers are so flattering im and which translates into curvy territory i didnt need extra length and the size was bigger than i need but not too big these are very classy looking and go with sandals to booties for every type of look summer to winter with a breezy top or a cozy sweater the revisitation of bell bottoms and culottes had me slightly down those cuts are not the most flattering for most people these jeans are smart but trendy
4,this dress is very pretty and would be nice for a summer wedding you will need to go braless or wear a strapless bra i am sending it back because as it runs very small i am a a and the size was too snug across the top
4,such a breath of fresh air the first thing i always want to know is if a showmovie is infected with the woke mind virus not this one secondly had it got good writing and production absolutely simply a brilliant throwback to quality entertainment fantastic
4,very good but the icing makes this cupcake complete
4,the colors of this dress really caught my eye i was hesitant to try it in the store because they only had a size and im normally a size when i tried it on i was pleasantly surprised that the dress fit around my hips success but like the other women that commented there was something funky going on in the midriff area the dress didnt accentuate my curves the stylist was available at the store i was at so she recommended that i belt it to add that extra umph the belt definitely di
4,i cant give that much feedback on this because i ended up returning it i was looking for the ideal memory mircosd card for a gopro and found a better model i did end up filming one event on this card and it did pretty good it did end up lagging after some time though just briefly
4,this is a very enjoyable recipie that is reminiscent of egg rolls without the rolling and frying it is a perfect recipe if a single person wants to bring an easy lunch with them for a few days and is balanced with veggies and protein the only thing is that it feels like it is missing something egg rolls arent the most flavorful to begin with and i dont know if for my taste if more garlic ginger onion or soy sauce needs added nonetheless a very good and simple recipie for my cooking arsenal
4,this bra is beautiful the lace is so lovely and soft and looks fabulous on my only criticism is it runs very small i am a a and order the size and it is snug just order a size up or two and it should be perfect
4,this laptop is doing the best work in this range
4,very cozy lounge tee but runs large i ordered a small rather than my usual medium and could of probably went down two sizes
4,everything is good except the battery and sound battery draining very fast and sound is very low
4,i like simple as a brand as it does feel very natural and not as chemical as other body washes this shower gel is really great if you want something less scented and more basic it feel friendly too skin and leaves you feeling clean and washed this review was collected as part of a promotion
4,this is a cute top that can transition easily from summer to fall it fits well nice print and its comfortable i tried this on in the store but did not purchase it because the color washed me out this is not the best color for a blonde would look much better on a brunette if this was in a different color i most likely would have purchased it
4,this is one of the finest if not the finest productions i have ever watched it scores high points from the writing to the direction and the acting hats off to taylor sheridan for allowing the audience to share his extreme talent and imagination to bring us such a lovely series comprising all five seasons the entire cast is absolutely amazing to be able to work with cattle and a ranch is no easy feat but they do a fantastic job in delivering it kevin costner as the patriarch is giving and shows us his growth as an actor but what blew me away was the acting chops and range of kelly reily who plays costners daughter she is one of the best actors i have ever had the joy of watching dawn olivieri plays her role as a villain convincingly while cole hauser is the epitome of a cowboy along with a superb performance as beths partner surprisingly primetime awards did not find yellowstone deserving of any awards which comes across as dubious and certainly unwarranted yellowstone is a must watch one you will want to binge watch highest stars for the whole team for a job well done with thanks
4,its all about the subject matter i dont like making heros out of criminals
4,its great value for money i purchased it around battery is around in heavy uses in watching movie of hours battery drop to percent some time my touchpad lags maybe after driver update it work properly maybe you should have to purchase cooling pads for heavy gaming otherwise its is very great choice no big issues there and every gaming device heats no issue and made for great high performing and its highly featured with great technologies speakers quality is excellent and i read more
4,very delicious tasted like doughnuts and were very sweet imwould modifynthe recipe to make it more diabetic friendly i added vanilla cinnamon and poudre douce which probably gave it moremof the dessert flavour no syrup required yummy
4,id say these are exactly aspictured and im happy with them they run a little big in the waist i most often wear xspetite in retailer sizes and can often wear xs regular but these are a bit loose i have a waist hips the drawstring tie solves that of course but its only in the front it doesnt go all the way around the waist the rest is elastic id also say these are highrise or long in the crotch but im only so theyre probably midrise on tall people i have them hi
4,kevin costner is brilliant in this s version to s dallas but so much better the filming acting cinematography location shooting and so on are all heads and shoulders above any normal tv show its like watching a great movie that plays every week with the plot and interest making us want to come back every week
4,hr batteryuse for small works
4,a good sweater but something about it was just not right for me just didnt feel like i would wear it
4,the lead actress has three expressions the constipated face the having a bowel movement face and finally finished the bowel movment face the constant closeups make them easy to spot the writing has gone down hill from episode it has been many years since i read the book i dont remember it being this bad
4,i love birds
4,i really love this show its hard to top christina ricci as wednesday addams but jenna ortega is amazing she really nails wednesday and she could carry this show all on her own fortunately she doesnt have to because the rest of the cast is also great emma myers is sure to be a breakout star from this show not since willow in the original buffy has there been such a wonderful sidekick gwendoline christie riki lindhome joy sunday and christina ricci herself really make this show work as well the writing and pacing of this show are perfect too everything moves along at a brisk pace and you never want to stop watching i really hope there is a season make it happen netflix youve struck gold with this show
4,i purchased the card in the sandisk packaging so i am pretty sure it is genuine i tested it with various programs on the web that apparently can detect whether they are fakes or not this one turned out to be a real sandisk card the card came formatted with fati read on the web about these micro sds and apparently they are not as fast as the full sd card version i borrowed my brothers sandisk gb full sd card to make comparison tests here are my officialunofficial test results using diskbench v and htestw test i will give the results as an overall result because after testing these cards over and over with speed writes and reads the results get mixed and varied to a big degree much larger than i expected but the numerous tests showed me a general trend the trend is that the full sd cards do write faster than the microsd card but also remember that the microsd had to be put into an adapter to do the test on my pc while the fullsd card was put into the computer reader directlythese are just my averages butsmall file writesboth sd cards wrote at close to mbsec the microsd was less consistent in the tests and sometimes dropped to mbsecsmall file readsboth sd cards read at close to mbsec at their fastestlarge file copies to cardmicrosd wrote at mbsec while the fullsd wrote at about mbseclarge file reads copies from cardmicrosd was mbsec while the fullsd read at about mbsecmy conclusionmy tests were by no means official for this card and showed much variance dependent on file size of the reads and writes but the fullsd card was faster in many cases but equal to microsd in most cases the small file writes and reads showed that they are similar enough but my only concern is with large file writes is mbsec good enough for rapid photography on a high pixel camera i dont know i have had no problem using these cards with h movie capture for hours i am surprised that mbsec is enoughalso never during the huge file copies to the card did i get any noticeable heating of the card itself by touch even for an hour ive noticed that it has been a complaint from many people on the web some stating that they felt they might burn themselves i copied files that took more than an hour with no noticeable temperature change other than perhaps a couple of degrees of course this was on a pc and not installed in a camerathe card performs well for video work and appears to meet many other tests performed by other people i never saw a read close to mbsec they were very consistent at mbsec at the highest performancei would get the card again if the price were right
4,the colors on this are beautiful i have wider hips and thighs and this blouse just looks too boxy on me i ordered a size down and from that aspect it fit however it is too flowy and boxy for my body type i considered keeping it for layering but even on sale it is too expensive for this purpose im so bummed because the colors are so pretty
4,missed half the dialogue due to the electric guitar background music and who in their right mind thought it was appropriate for a period drama
4,he is very sweet yet a little loud to put him right next to a baby
4,i added a tablespoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of cloves to the rhubarb next time ill add even more very good
4,first of all this jean fits really well but i usually wear a in mother jeans and i had to go up to a in these ugh because they just ran smaller or whatever i am curvy on the bottom but the s just felt too tight and pulled everywhere second the color is not quite right in this picture it looks more military green it is not it is a much brighter military green vs a moss green that is throwing me a bit not quite as versatile or neutral to me meanwhile the styling with the
4,wore this dress for easter dinner and received many compliments it is delicate and if not careful the diamond pattern can snag i loved the comfort and ability to dress up or down i ordered the regular instead of petite as i wanted the length at my knees not thigh high and it fit perfect at
4,im a big fan of paige jeans these are perfect for my petite frame at they were ankle length i tried my normal paige size and ultimately sized up for a better fit at the waist
4,very moist and denseyum didnt really taste the guinness though so easy to make
4,next time ill leave out the italian dressing it gave it a sweetness that i felt was out of place and ill use more beef and less onion between the salsa and the whole onion it was just about too much but in general a good recipe
4,my husband doesnt care for apple pie but he really liked this i will make this again i also put cinnamon in it because we like cinnamon in apple desserts
4,i liked the top it is cute but i didnt keep it as i have similar tops like it and i had better options however color it is true that htere are differentials in the coloring of fabrics in this top but that is not necessairly a bad thing it kind of gives t personality lace part this is where i have a similr one tank all alce like that darker ivory drkest part of hte shirt cut to neck is flatetering and different from the low lunging things we see a lot of body true to size i
4,the acting skills direction production quality of the show is top notch henry cavill is superb first being a avid fan of witcher books and games i was a bit skepticle on seeing the trailers etc but oh my the show is just plainly good some people comparing the show to got because they dont have any knowledge about the witcher universe and comparing mainly on the basis of swords and clothes they see a fan of witcher will truly love and enjoy the show henry cavill is the real witcher lol
4,i really like this jumpsuit it is long waisted on me so i hope that washing it helped love the material and washed up nicely should be really comfortable
4,no depth no nuances no point no substance just one cliche after another the only redeeming quality is the filming
4,i enjoyed this casserole and served it for easter breakfast at my house we really liked the combination of the cheddar and swiss cheeses i did add some seasoned salt and pepper to taste as i thought it needed some seasoning
4,i bought this in both the navy a more saturated blue in person gorgeous and green but both are going back it fit everywhere but in the upper arms even across my chest and i usually encounter the opposite i think it might just be the way its cut across the shoulders that dont allow for much movement so while beautiful and so incredibly soft it has to go back if you have slender arms i think it would be a great fit
4,superb laptop
4,i just received this in the mail today it is very cute however it will be going back if you look at the picture of the back it look like there is only one opening however below the knot there is another opening
4,i havent played the video game but ive seen other people playing the game on the internet and i can say that i dont think there is a better story than this when i saw the trailer for this series i was so happy and excited the series itself is very good the casting is also good i can say instead that im a little disappointed with the casting they did for ellie because the actress doesnt really look like the character in the video games but bella ramsey even if she didnt have the looks managed to sell us ellie through her behavior and her gestures also pedro pascal is the best choice for joel and he played the role incredibly well i cant wait to see season and the other seasons that will be made
4,value for money product
4,overall its a good product but for college usage purposes battery backup is poor battery it last around hrs max display its average design its good looking no backlit keyboard performance its good
4,i love this blouse the color is so pretty i might even wear this to a holiday party the tie looks great so many wayslove the versatility i think i will get a lot of wear out of this blousewith a pencil skirt jeans or under a blazer
4,i had been eyeing these for a while but as they didnt seem very popular i figured id wait for a sale i finally bought them at the off of sale price yay and i love them theyre extremely comfortable and very flattering id say they run true to size but maybe on the smaller end of the size for the waist the blue pants are more greenish in color than the picture shows but still beautiful im looking forward to wearing these now and into the spring
4,what the heck happened season is a joke no story development too much fluf and fillers script is so poor this season that im almost giving up i used to love this show i think season is phenomenal and i wonder what happened to justify the fall im really curious
4,season was exceptional they got reacher exactly right his style his mannerisms his violence when provoked so anything else would be hard to get right season misses by a mile radius its trite boring and formulaic the story is dull and the real richer is lost in dross such a shame season could have been exceptional tooit isnt season was exceptional they got reacher exactly right his style his mannerisms his violence when provoked so anything else would be hard to get right season misses by a mile radius its trite boring and formulaic the story is dull and the real richer is lost in dross such a shame season could have been exceptional tooit isnt
4,great easy to wear wrap dress rich colors are fabulous for fall the contrasting knit back adds just the right touch to make the dress more interesting as compared to your typical paisley print dress i ended up with a petite as the length seemed more flattering and the bust line fit better than the regular
4,my family liked this dish i might add less flour to the sauce next time seemed very mild to me in flavor but the dish went together well and froze well a keeper
4,i do not think that this show would be anything better than your usual teen drama show to be fair the characters were not the greatest and there were some pretty cringy moments that i didnt like there was some distracting product placement also but all in all this show was not bad and was actually pretty darn good jenna ortegas performance is what really brings this show to life it honestly might be the only reason i wanted to finish this show i suppose there was some suspense at the end but there were other times that reminded me that this is a netflix teen drama there was alot of fluff in the story that could have been avoided it felt like they were just trying to throw you off of who is involved really relying on using a twist at the end that honestly didnt really work out
4,build quality awesome only is missing there is backlit and
4,the first series was amazing but the second series is just awful the script is beyond terrible and the only thing that had kept me going is the the main character is called ciri high sounds very similar to another totally incompetent person no names mentioned but i imagine if you asked that half wit the story line heshe wouldnt have a clue either its awful just embarrassed for the entire crew normally goes at least a couple of seasons before becoming this bad embarrassing beyond belief no connection with story characters or anything else wheels have come off entirely
4,this recipe is really good i changed it up a bit i used ground venison and made my own italian dressing i also doubled the recipe and used one can of black beans and one can of refried beans i disagree with most of the people on here about this recipe being fast and easy i started it at and by the time i was done with all the chopping it was definitely a weekend meal
4,we did enjoy the fajitas but i like it better with lime as opposed to lemon and i add a sauce for a little extra zip
4,budget friendly
4,its a nice product worked perfectly with windows however it doesnt quite work when placed inside my att samsung galaxy s files copied into it are not shown in the ss file browser googled a bit for this problem and i concluded its my phones problem
4,most of the attention in season seems to be on the back ground music and the thailand setting production quality and attention to details for the back drops excellent but its just so boring sooo anticlimactic after season and my rating went from an easy for the first two seasons to frustrating watch ive never been so hopeful for a season its a slow burn but the burn is silly at this point if the viewer invested in so many episodes without any reward the acting is good and the characters were chosen well which makes it even more frustrating the hard points and lessons of the other two seasons are falling short for each repetitive episode of this season
4,the pattern while beautiful is on a much more yellowivory background than pictured the skirt is very voluminous and the elastic waist seemed very loose like it would not support the skirt while i did like it i didnt love it so it had to go back
4,i understand the style of this dress is swing but there is just so much fabric and it looked a bit like a tent on me i ordered the s and i just found it to be too loose all over the fabric is great and the colors are rich and lovely this style would probably look better on someone smallerchested because there is no waist it falls out from the bustline cute dress but i would size down
4,added a beer hot sauce extra cup of cheddar and chicken broth to give it the kick we wanted served with baguette
4,the show is entertaining but the story doesnt make a lot of sense there are a lot of plot holes and the dialogue is hard to understand theres a lot of talking and mumbling and twists and turns and turns and twists and you end up scratching your head because it doesnt make sense and the flashbacks add nothing to the story also somehow reacher is a super genius and an expert on everything yeah a real know it all he even teaches martha stewart how to bake while playing chess and correcting stephen hawkinss paper on astrophysics he also knows what everyone is going to do before they do it also where are all of the venezuelans coming from i think he killed the same venezuelans times throughout the show and he just leaves the bodies laying around everywhere
4,i used applesauce rather than oil next time i make them i will use half oilhalf applesauce to remedy their dryness at the edges they stuck to the baking papers
4,if you are looking for a nice vest this vest is nice enough comfortable and soft the cut is also flattering but i just didnt think it was as special as i wanted it looks like many other options out there so i decided to pass xs fit me at lbs
4,used in my phone its plenty fast and works just like it should unexpectedly comes with mini and full sd card size adapters which is nice foolproof packaging or whatever it was that was laughable packaging was decent it just shouldnt have bragged about being impossible to mess up when i messed it up
4,if you want to feel something like really feel something you watch this show it just such a good show but not for you if you cant handle the really dark concepts but it just makes you appreciate things and also makes you want to like become a lawyer and fight to make things better elizabeth moss is really such a phenomenal actress
4,i like this top a lot very nice i love the design style and fabric but it runs too small i have a curvy figure and it pulls in the front so you can see between the buttons and pulls at the bottom as well i usually wear l or xl in xl this one was still a bit fitted especially around the bust i am still keeping it hoping to lose a few pounds but it is a very nice top with the fabric design and style very stylish it looks casual on the model but can be dressy
4,i got this dress in neutral motif looks very cute and the size is perfect
4,the mandalorian is single handily saving the star wars universe this show in my opinion has not had one bad episode season really drove me to write this review and express my year of love for this show the mandalorian season truly brought tears to the eye of watchers not only because of the surprise at the end but because of the amazing acting the acting in this show is truly incredible and they have some of the best in the world in my opinion the only shows better than this all time are breaking bad and game of thrones when the mandalorian is all said and done im confident it will be above game of thrones but it will need to blow my socks off the way breaking bad did to pass it
4,my first ever laptop lets journey begin
4,holy crap what a show this is perhaps the best star wars has ever been since maybe even better in an era of star wars dominated by cheaplooking and overbudgeted streaming shows andor stands out with brilliant visuals acting writing and set design it truly has everything what started as a tv show about the nd main character from rogue one has become the definitive story about the fight against fascism the most obvious place to start showering praise is of course the technical aspects the visuals are unparalleled even by other star wars movies the set design and cinematography immerse you in this galaxy far far away and it has never felt more alive and wellrealised the score is masterfully put together and it would take a whole other essay to explain why for once a star wars tv show looks worth its massive budget the next aspect that is immaculate is of course the writing damn is this show wellwritten from character conversations to absolute topnotch monologues all the writing is full of subtext and nuance this extends to the characters as well almost every character is memorable and fleshed out in this show oneoff characters go through strong arcs and the main characters are absolutely amazing cassian andor is now one of the best characters in all of star wars in keeping with this shows high standards the acting is excellent diego luna genevieve oreilly stellan skarsgård adria arjona denise gough and kyle soller all give excellent performances this just a small list of the actors who bring their agame everyone plays their characters to perfection finally this show might just be the most politically relevant of this decade star wars has always taken its influences from the politics of its time but never has it been more apparent here this show is unabashedly about the fight against fascism exploring how fascist organisations oppress manipulate and consume people the true cost of fighting against it and the morally complex choices the characters have to make for the sake of rebellion all of it is done with care and nuance and it is all emotionally riveting overall this not only stands as the very best star wars has to offer it is one of the finest tv shows ever made it is infinitely rewatchable excellently written with no shortage of excellent spectacle a treat for fans and nonfans
4,someones making good star wars again this series is oozing star wars without relying too much on fan service it has fantastic locations actors story and dialogue too many series these days make the misstake not giving the audience any likeable characters to root for cassian is not the only one that you get invested in here theres bix mon luthen brasso to name just a few just look at the enormous difference between got and hotd where got had so many good and bad characters one cared for and hotd have none imho andor is what i dreamt of to experience after watching the original trilogy its easy to see that the creators with tony gilroy at helm absolutely understands and love star wars imagine what wonders we would have gotten if tony gilroy had been given the charge over the franchise from the get go a fantastic series and i envy those of you that have yet to experience it
4,laptop is very nice display is average
4,very quick and easy we actually had to eat this the day after due to a change in our plans and it was still very good
4,wasnt expecting such a good series started watching just for fun but it really turn out to be a fantastic series its really a worth watching jenna ortega as wednesday is just outstandingim in love with her performance emma myers as enid is too cute to handle all other cast is also wonderful also there is a surprise member the thingyou will only know if you have watched the series not for a second you are out of your seat the whole time it really keeps going interesting the plot is not that easy to predict you will get a lot of surprises the whole time just waiting for season to come
4,i started watching this show without knowing anything about it imdb recommended it for me that i trusted it i didnt know that it will become my favorite show for all times i watched only episodes for now but ive already become addicted to it aside from astonishing cinematography the story captured me i live in turkey and the situation is very similar to our countrys course of events it gives me goosebumps from time to time seeing that such a situation may also occur in here as well the change happens slowly nothing happens in one night and whatever happens women are the ones who lose the most there are strong opinions of some people that our sole reason for existence is to reproduce which is very common in turkey as well the show reminds me again and again why secularism is so important i highly recommend this show to everyone around me for those who are not from religious countries should also watch it because when there is need for change the religion seems to be the easiest way to influence masses and it is possible in even us or other developed countries regardless of their improvements on secularism or womens rights
4,it has you on the edge of your seat screaming at the injustice of the situation each episode finds you in brilliant acting totally original and disturbing storyline cant wait for the next series
4,performance of the product is so good and th gen laptop in this price is valuable
4,pros build quality you get quite solid build unlike other laptops at similar price point speakers loud and clear for a laptop laptops are not inherently designed to enjoy media consumption yet it offers reasonably good loudness and the clarity is commendable performance is impressive at this price point as far as multitasking is concerned this wont disappoint you suitable for office work schoolcollege work cons display tn panel if youre a first time buyer yo read more
4,i ordered a petite medium in black and it fit great great some of the other reviews said it was tight but i found it pretty loose and flowy also felt it was plenty of coverage wore it to work casual workplace and transitioned to happy hour beautifully
4,these are a great dark wash and they fit true to size to every other stevies i own for reference i am lbs size m and the fit perfect they are a bit long but i fold them up and it looks just as cute i highly recommend especially since they are on sale definitely a closet staple
4,season was ok but i wouldnt rave about it even the hotel manager was a total moron hard to decide which ones were the most unlikable guests and staff both however although season had a number of flawed individuals you could still empathise with them this season was quite creepy in parts and i hope there is a season so we can see certain characters get their just deserts speaking for myself this lot seemed pretty normal with the same types of issues us less wealthier mortals are blessed with they just handle them differently i dont know a lot happened in the last episode and i think theres a major loose end that need to be tied up update season deducting a star for season so far i think even minus but im giving it the benefit of the doubt for now nope minus after ep another minus for the finale i am afraid a huuuge disappointment
4,these jeans are so comfortable and they are made of the softest fabric i love that they can be dressed up or down love these
4,super cute and soft on the other hand the otters breathing mechanism makes enough noises and sometimes blocks so i disable it only negative point
4,looks like the budget is tight but the show is good so far after watching first episode ive noticed some say it keeps to the story but im new to this and its pretty enjoyable
4,material is kind of thick stretchy the orange i ordered was just too bright for me im and got the i think the wouldve worked better sending back mostly bc the color didnt look good on me
4,i am and curvy and this dress fit me perfectly its great for parties and weddings depending on how formal the only reason i gave it four stars is because the fabric is a little strange the ribbing for the squares is almost like a pillowy fabric and it feels a little bit on the cheaper side but luckily it doesnt look cheap nonetheless i love this dress and would definitely recommend
4,love this cream sleeveless topit goes with everything and you can dress it up or down this will be a go to top all summer long and probably wear thru the fall as well with a layered sweater if needed i typically wear small or medium size and got the medium hoping for a little longer length i am c and overall wt of approx lbsit fits very nicely thank you retailer
4,this romper was so cute and with the great reviews i thought i needed to try itbut once trying it on i realized it was an odd fit there is not enough fabric to make it look as relaxed as it does on the model also the sleeves were a bit wider than they look in the picture would probably work well for someone with a petite figure
4,very good gaming pc in this price range
4,great gaming laptop love it totally battery works only for few hours disappointed by battery but great laptop
4,my newborn daughter of months goes crazy has various functions from the tummy that lights up to the effect of the breath of the lullaby i really like that it is easily washable in the washing machine and it is really soft and cuddly as a play
4,i have been a fan of lee childs jack reacher novels i have read every single one of them childs creation of a unique american character doing good as he travels the country captured my imagination and i look forward to his next novel the amazon video version is as good as a book to video conversion can get it captures reachers essence and character ticks all of the things that make reacher reacher are here yeah he frequently takes his short off but that is for the women it certainly got my wife to stop complaining that i was watching something violent it also gives reacher a dry sense of humor i sat there with a big smile in my face during the two episodes i watched i am a fan this series follows childs first reacher story it was so long age i cannot honestly say i remember the details two episodes in i can say it works the best part of this series is that it helps replace the mental stain of a diminutive tom cruise playing the part of someone whose character is based on being a huge strong man i highly recommend this for anyone who like action or detective films
4,overall a good product from hp
4,good for normal day to day work
4,since the reviews are quite polarized for this dress i thought id throw in my first to clarify there is indeed a zipper its wellhidden under the l arm i didnt think there was one based on the reviews and got it on zipped fine once it was on i could feel the zipper not uncomfortably i just realized there was one dress does not have a lot of give so i imagine that zipped it would be difficult to get off because no give dont order down that said i found this dress to
4,its almost a week since i am using this laptop and i just wanted to say display speakers performance is good all over its good
4,one of my first rompers its super cute i need to get used to the puffy sleeves but my husband also really likes it and hes definitely got an opinion about these things
4,just good
4,overall this laptop is good at k display is good disign is good performance is great and battery backup is hr in normal uses decent battery not good and this product is value for money
4,the dress is gorgeous material is soft great design but runs at least one size small and very long im and even with in heels its way to long alteration needed
4,product is good but performance isnt much better
4,i love deadwood dont get me wrong but its a travesty this series isnt more widely known at its core its a struggle centered around some very heavy social issues without being preachy or heavy handed anyone who has history or a love of the west will most likely love this the settings are beautiful and will remind you of what you remember growing up or visiting this area growing up around deadwood sd its no secret kevin costner has a great love of this area and he does it justice in this series if you arent hooked by the second episode this isnt for you i can understand someone growing up in an urban area never having first hand experience in this country not taking to this series but having family in the rodeo relatives that used to break wild horses run cattle ranches etc there is truth to a lot that is told here obviously there is hyperbole and poetic license with some of the concepts but at its core i never stop being impressed how they make the plots and story lines compelling without preaching or explaining everything as if they were fishing for approval at the end of the day i am glad people like kevin costner take the time to put together things like this for others to enjoy had a friend not mentioned it at a party i would have never run across it and i literally drive through these settings every year to my parents place in the black hills in sd regarding volume issues i see reported i purchased on microsoft movies and have a surround system and it sounded great
4,nice creamy recipe makes a lot of sauce i increased the amount of pasta
4,i waited and waited for this i had to force myself to watch each and every episode i kept telling myself it would get betterit didnt slow boring and not worth the time spent
4,every thing is good about this laptop only thing which i feel that could be better is the battery rest of all is star
4,i struggle with finding a moisturiser which lasts all day without me getting mid way through the day and feeling my legs are itchy and dry ive always been willing to pay a fair bit if i find the right product this one ticks the box as its not expensive and is a really great cream i dont feel the need to reapply great find for a moisturers i will be buying again this review was collected as part of a promotion
4,yellowstone is a solidly written drama great characters wellcrafted that draws its tone from a few different modernday masterpieces it has the feel and cinematography of longmire the plotting and grim outlook of the sopranos and the dramatic dynamics of shows like dynasty or any of the other network dramas similar to that much respect must go to costner and cole hauser these guys bring it i did not expect to get drawn in to this show like i did its well worth your time
4,this is very good
4,overall working good but the only problem i m facing that the files transfer rate is very very slow
4,sleeves were a bit too long and the size was too big but its really cute and if they had a smaller size i would definitely have exchanged
4,i saw it without any expectations but this one is so much fun than we saw it in trailer everyone can watch this without any second though definitely you wont regret i saw it without any expectations but this one is so much fun than we saw it in trailer everyone can watch this without any second though definitely you wont regretsaw it without any expectations but this one is so much fun than we saw it in trailer everyone can watch this without any second though definitely you wont regretsaw it without any expectations but this one is so much fun than we saw it in trailer saw it without any expectations but this one is so much fun than we saw it in trailer
4,my year old helped me make these so she could take a treat to daycare they were a big hit they never knew that they were eating their vegetables great recipe
4,whats more to say this is the biggest microsdxc card at the time with the reliability of sandisk with great speed i have one in all of my tablets and both mobile phones i have yet to have an issue with this card and dont expect to
4,i have absolutely no idea as to why it took me this long to finally sit down and commit to watching this show after months and months of hearing amazing reviews and clips across the internet i finally went for it and man what a show usually it takes me two or three episodes to get into a show and really start to enjoy the characters and see the plot but episode one had me committed right off the bat i am so happy pedro pascal was casted as joel his acting is phenomenal and he has a lot to offer for the plot and script i genuinely enjoyed watching ellie and joels growing relationship on screen and loved the dynamic as well looking forward to the next season and cannot wait to see where the writers take it
4,great product and amazing working as well would have been good if had gb ram at this price but still its
4,thin and soft lays nicely formfitting but with enough fabric to move around and scrunch up without looking tight the doublev makes it shift downward so the cut in front is pretty low i have to keep adjusting it so it doesnt show too much not sure how itll hold up after a couple washes because the fabric is so lightweight
4,great writing acting directing production might have a few cringe moments but this show was well thought out it has meaning it forces you to pay attention
4,the back of this top is nice but it is very flowy i ordered a small dd normally a in retailer tops a smaller size would fit better but is not available overall nice but wish it came in a smaller size
4,very excellent productworking fine after one month no bad things happen
4,when i saw the serie i didnt know the storythe characters etc because i have never played the game or read the books so my critic is from the side that didnt know about the witcher i think the story is well scripted the dialogues are fun and the actors especially calvin did a great job by representing them all characters have an original language especially gerald and this makes the show more interesting furthermore it contains irony which makes scenes enjoyable i found problems by distinguishing flashback scenes with present scenes they should do something about it in general this show is amazing and i cant wait for season
4,i purchased this sweater in the grey color and loved it so much i decided to buy it in purple as well however when i received it the color was much much darker than pictured and even looked black sometimes decided to return
4,so when i first found this dress it was already on sale and sold out in petites for reference i am and currently weighing in at about and my bust is a d the store near my work has a petite shop thank goodness so i headed there after my day they didnt have it in my size but they did have the regular sizing in a which i promptly purchased the crossed part sits a little higher than my natural waist but i think for someone with a slightly smaller chest it would hit spot on
4,i have been looking for a soft turtleneck that can be my togo piece in the cold weather this fits the bill as far as the material goes the material used is very soft and even though it seems light in weight it is actually very warm and not see through at all i like the feel of this top it would be pretty accurate to say that it feels as if i am wearing a blanket around me it is that comfy however the one detail about this top that i am unsure about is the cut it is very boxy to the e
4,the color of this top is perfect for summer it is a light lilac tone the fabric is also light and super soft great cut too even my husband liked the cut of the shirt i ordered a large based on other reviews but found the arms to be a little tight but not enough not to keep the top the shirt does run slim being a d i do have to keep the top buttons unbutton but i am okay with wearing a little cami under the shirt
4,the dress is nice love the embroidery love the front cinch but why not all the way around the back is fast flat so cinching makes the sides stick outgot petite and the sizing was nice i just didnt love the overall look on my body type
4,wifi keeps disconnecting and display quality bit low budget wise ok
4,i love this beautiful summer dress i am tall and this dress is a great length on me sometimes with highlow dresses the high is too short but this dress is perfect it does run large i originally ordered a medium but had to return it for a small it is very voluminous my only complaint would be the arm holes are huge i am going to have to wear a camisole or bandeau top under it or you can see my bra
4,super leptop he
4,overall laptop is good few important points whoever is going to purchase ram is not upgradable typec port doesnt support display only datapower this means your typec dock will also not work for display you may try display link docks but they are too costly webcam and speakers are very average performance overall design keyboard and display are good in this price range i bought gb model around k tried fedora linux everything worked out of the box
4,ive never read the books but i saw the movies with tom cruise he plays a cool guy with fighting skills but is a miscast imo since tom is not that tall and not that menacing anyways the tv show looks great i love the casting not only the main character and is strange to see an actual good show with no woke agenda and quota filling just for the sake of it i got hooked after the first episode and now i cant wait for the second season well done
4,buy the laptop
4,while i have to agree with some other reviewers that this is not the most flattering coat as a size with hips it does my hips no favors but the comfort and warmth make up for it this coat is so soft its like wearing a puffy blanket unlike typical puffer coats it does not have any kind of vinyl feel to it but nor does it have any wind or water resistance at all with all that said the comfort and cosy feel won me over ive received several compliments as well so maybe its more
4,this is a great tee i bought this in the green in a size m im normally a small but because of the fitted look i opted for the medium i probably could have sized down to the small but the medium is still fitted just not too tight which is actually a nice look the only thing i wish was different are the sleeves the sleeves are just a little too puffy for me but its so cute that im keeping it
4,i got this in light green and its a gorgeous color first tried a small but it was a little too wide and long exchanged for xs looks great now i just hope it doesnt shrink too much
4,this was very good and very easy i did substitute italian sausage as many suggested and i agree that the finished product would have been way too bland with just ground beef my only thought on this recipe is that ravioli pasta is much thicker than sheets of lasagna so add more meat and cheese to compensate
4,every good except speaker sound of speaker in loud sound they sound like distorted and not so much good screen good battery just ok design is also just ok i got gb ssd for k so at that point it is value for money
4,netflix has a documented history of butchering characters from other sources i give tim burton credit for not doing that here i was not expecting a murdermystery series but this worked well the writers left very few clues so that you dont know for sure who the villaina is until closer to the end i personally prefer there to be easter eggs pointing to who that is but this leaves it open to be anybody regarding jenna ortega i think she did an amazing job considering she is and portraying a year old she brings a lot of experience and skill to the role at the same time it also makes you appreciate how well ricci did in the movie she was only and did a remarkable job and still portrayed some innocence ortega does a great job showing teenage angst and rebellion against their parents like so many teens do understanding the two are portraying the same character but at possibly different ages allows one to believe in a continuance of the character like the series the crown
4,we are a garlic family so this was a great recipe for us my kids had seconds so this momma was thrilled the meat was fork tender and the sauce was a nice mix of sweet and savory between the sugar and the soy sauce would make again plenty for meals this this family of
4,i absolutely fell in love with the design of this dress the colors and cut are easy to wear but unique enough to stand out i was between the medium and the small and ultimately went with the medium the dress hits right above my knee fits nicely at my waist and is well made the top does seem a bit loose as pictured on the model but i prefer a slightly more fitted look a padded bra would probably have filled out the extra fabric but it was an easy alteration and will allow me to wear the
4,laptop was good but hp have a heating problem
4,i had purchased other sanctuary black petite leggings in the store and found these on line they are very flattering and wellmade runs a little small i am and lbs small fit more loosely which i prefer so i can wear them to work thanks retailer for carrying great petite selection
4,quick and easy makes for a wonderful weeknight dinner when you have kids with sporting events or other things going on i also like to add green chiles to spice it up a bit
4,i was bummed about this dress i saw it online and loved both colors i tried it on in the store and it did not work for me i am tall with an hourglass figure and it was too shot and too loose it looked like a babydoll nightgown i wanted to love it but i think this one only works on smaller frames onto the next
4,great build quality and display
4,the h series chipset is indeed a powerhouse designed to deliver topnotch performance that can handle demanding tasks with ease its no surprise that its the goto choice for those who prioritize speed and reliability in their computing experience however the tradeoff for this high performance is the increased battery consumption a common challenge in performanceoriented laptops the oled display adds to the visual experience with its vibrant colors and deep blacks but it also contri read more
4,got this is not but its a very entertaining fantasy series with interesting characters situations and monsters the corny dialogue hacky metaphors and excruciating song lyrics are awful but the action moves along briskly enough that you can overlook it and enjoy the ride
4,i know everyone is obsessed with this show and i can see why the acting is really good not only by the main actors but all supporting actors i didnt play the game so cant compare but i have heard its exactly the same the storyline is decent but id say that i enjoy every second episode it starts off well and gripped me but some episodes are just too slow for me i can do slow if its gripping like true detective or breaking bad at times amazing shows but for some reason this just didnt do it for me thats not to say its a bad show its well made and shot but i didnt get super excited each week when the episodes came out to the people bagging episode it was the most beautiful piece of television ive seen and im a straight female you need to get a life if youre disgusted by it
4,best laptop under k in offer
4,wanted to love this dress the fabric is very nice pretty colors great quality and style it just didnt work for my body type it would fit great on someone with narrower shoulders probably want to size down
4,cute top in theoryended up looking a little sloppy the sleeves are a bit too blousey for my taste and i really wanted the laceup to be cuter somehow still a cute top received several compliments but not for me
4,dont really use this for speed tests or anything but to hold music and everything it works great would recommend doesnt fail a lot and lose files
4,oh my goodness creamy and comforting will make often this winter
4,overall the product i received was value for money but the only con i faced was its speakers
4,its a memory card that simply worked when i plugged it in not the fastest but not the most expensive
4,got this laptop at k with card offers everything is good except processor it is not as good as intel and hangs sometimes but if you are a normal it shouldnt create any issues
4,made it for a family get together casserole did not last very long the men loved it
4,ok lets start with the only good thing i can say the acting of ortega was amazing probably the best wednesday weve ever had so far the facial expressions were top mayers acting was also very good and gave very very good contrast and thats about the only good thing i can say first that monster looks like rabid gollum who was created by ai via loony toon generator it looks bad neither scary nor interesting and with all the good cgi troughouth the movie the monster was plain bad you cant take it serious when you see these huge eyes like that storywise mediocre tho not terrible buuuut besides the few twists everything was so predictable and obvious incl the twists camerawork was decent ok cant say its bad but its not superb either its ok there were some well placed and executed shots editing was also decently good now about the characters wednesday as i said was superb thing was also good tho you cant screw his character easily enid was also solid character alongside bianca the rest nothing good or interesting many random fillers and clichés thornhill christina ricci as a character was very out of place up until the last episode you see her there just for the rating because heey thats the original wednesday not the original ofc as theres s series as well but i felt her presense there was just a plain nostalgia play she didnt bring anything to the story at all lurch was short what the hell was that lurch is supposed to be slim but very tall and intimidating this one was not intimidating at all gomez didnt have any proper vibe ok i get it it looks like the comics but gomez is supposed to be madly in love with morticia and he gave no such vibe at all morticia was supposed to have deep but very cold love for gomez and we see no chemistry between them at all no matter how many french kisses there are the spark is not there and you need not a spark but a bonefire with them two nostalgia elements were so tastelesly put there having fester there just for the sake of nostalgia no real good reason for him there having classic sentences like you rang out of place the signiture snapping with fingers just random nostalgia put in random place for the sake of the old one so if youre a fan of the s version you wont probably enjoy this one if you havent seen any addams before you may or may not enjoy it besides being predictable and mediocre its not the worst thing ive seen so its ok
4,in our cowardly new world is this what happens when artificial intelligence steps in all of the life and soul have been drained out the dialogue is wooden cliched and plodding largely centered on melodrama with occasional flare ups of trademark violence the plot is just a mundane exercise in bowling set up some bad guys and bowl them over repeat even reacher himself comes across now as a cyborg or terminatormaybe even an ai creation i will suffer it no longer and am sorely tempted to revisit season to see if it was even good to begin with and i had just had a lapse in discernment but i know it was good one exquisite moment was when formula bad guy robert patrick looking awful who famously played an enemy cyborg terminator in terminator years ago looks at a list of aliases and says who the hell is sarah conner nice its intriguing to me that the terminator series focused a lot on artificial intelligence taking over the world and reacher season has all the appearance of having been written acted and crafted by artificial intelligence maybe the writers strike precipitated this hard to figure out how season could be so bad in contrast to season its like the positivenegative of a photo
4,a wonderfully heavy weight piece opposed to all the swingy chambray of summer this piece will transition wonderfully into fall the only disadvantage is a relatively high neck which looks lovely but can be a little restrictive at times highly recommend
4,ok so yes it is true that the top part where the sleeves are can be snug a little especially if you work out but overall i found the top to run true to my regular size i only tried on the didnt try bigger the length was great for me being short i didnt think i need the petite i usually do for pants and skirtsdresses tops on and off the look of the shirt is also classic flowy and it looked great with e half tuck the embroidery is also nice though one part of it seemed loose a
4,im towards the end of series and i have enjoyed every one of them i love how they transport me to the locations with stunning pictures of scenery and authentic music from that country so much better than having to hear a familiar english sung pop song as other series churn out the actors are great and whether its an annoying character they are playing or not i love them all stifflers mum is so unlikeable in her selfishness but at the same time i was itching to know what happened next with her its also great how some of the previous storylines flow into the next series i am episodes away from the end of series three and i am itching to watch the rest and yet feel sad that it will be over i love christian friedel and its great to see him in this season and along side his brilliant acting i hope he gets to sing this has to be one of the best series i ve seen and trying to watch the last of us new series has certainly shown me that it is nowhere in comparison with white lotus so much that i cant watch it anymore i will be looking forward to series every season is great and i wouldnt want to change anything brilliant work from the writers and directors and of course the actors
4,the sauce is thick and very tasty the only negative i have is that as others mentioned the rice was not fully tender even after cooking longer than called for next time i make these and we definitely liked them enough to make again i will either try minute rice or else use precooked regular rice i got one and a half inch meatballs from a pound of ground beef
4,this is an allpurpose outfit wellmade good material it can be worn many ways
4,is this the most faithful version of reacher to the books sounds like it from other fan reviews but does it actually translate well to the silver screen thats the better question and the answer isnot really it could be because of the the forced dialogue which is often unnecessarily complicated and overly expositional it could be that not a single character is a believable human being even though the acting is mostly on par it could be that reacher himself is a marty stu with a mind like sherlock but with the body and facial expression range of a tree trunk it could be that the action sequences are fun though there is some overly graphic scenes that dont match the tone of the rest of the show it could be the romance is basically a paperthin case of attractive people existing in the same story and not much else it could be that it feels like an interesting lead stuck in the same mediocre crime drama thats been done a hundred times and it could be that thats what the books are really like in which case the best thing the show runners could have done for it would have been to be less faithful to the source material its too bad they werent overall entertaining but forgettable
4,he is a truly talented actor of our time bravo you entertain me to the fullest thank you for your commitment and dedication i really value your art i write this after watching the peaky blinders finale but base my comments on all efforts thank you
4,i purchased the blue one its a very brilliant royal blue nice color the patterned portion is quite heavy which provides a nice drape hangs really well without being clingy or too loose great top for jeans
4,it looks like the stores are finally receiving their supply of this really pretty dress ive been watching its availability online and was getting frustrated my local store had ample supply its a beautiful dress as per an earlier review it does run a little large i love that its made of cotton so it will be perfect in the summer and beyond its a full skirt but looks really pretty on my local store showed it belted which looked good too
4,impressive story about a woman forced to become a slave trying to survive in a distopic world a world where under the name of god crimes are being justified horrifying story has some analogies with the nazi period what i like is that the main characters are not one dimensional sometimes you hate them sometimes you feel sorry for them very well played ive seen seasons in days its very difficult to put the series aside this is the only series that keeps me thinking after watching imagining what i would have done if i lived in that world a must see series
4,i will try this recipe but definitely need to add garlic also i would use mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar cheese love cheddar cheese but pasta needs garlic and mozzarella
4,what an amazing production after watching a few episodes i was not surprised to see the vast list of nominations and awards they received or win this tv series reached a new level in balancing tragedy and hope they really found a great way to touch viewers hearts and keep us thrilled i lost count of how many times i found myself in tears of joy and sadness i can keep mentioning for hours all the reasons i consider this a great production i really cant found a single way for improve it it is simply superb
4,it arrived quickly was easy to install now if i can just figure out how to save data onto it from my device
4,i bought a new samsung galaxy note phone and needed an expansion card to boost up the memory for photos and music this is the cheapest gb card i could find works well
4,i tried this in the black and white in the store the material is very thin you cannot wear the white without a cami which defeats the purpose of wearing this tank in the summery the arm holes are cut very inconsistently some are very big which creates a very unflattering gap under the armpit others are cut fine i tried on different smalls in the black and found one that was cut just right this does fit snuggly but is more flattering that way
4,best for students really it is too awesome but only for students not for gaming editing or other perpose
4,this cream is light odourless and leaves the skin feeling genuinely smooth supple and refreshed i use it as part of my nightly routine applying it when going to bed after washing and drying my face it is light enough not to clog the pores or feel sticky on the face and in the morning my face always feels smooth and replenished i have also tried using this cream during the daytime and while it has all the benefits described above itus not longlasting enough in terms of the hydration it gives meaning you often feel the need to reapply after a few hours all in all a great overnight moisturiser if you have sensitive skin itus unscented and itus really gentle on sore patches this review was collected as part of a promotion
4,this is a beautiful richlycolored top fits well very pleased only negative is the button is covered in same material can be easily nicked with your fingernail
4,it is a pretty dress but not what i had hoped for i ordered it online i like slits on sleeves but the dress doesnt fit me well so i plan to return it ps it has pockets
4,im very happy with this sweaterits very soft to the touch and comfortable to wear i have the pink version and find the shimmer on the waist and arms to be a nice touch the only concern i have for this is that it feels like it stretches out a bit easily by the end of the day the arms feel a bit baggy
4,i love love love this show this show explores the themes of generational conflict race relations class relations gender relations and general power dynamics in modern society through carefully woven interconnected storylines while also managing to be hilarious the way the fates of the characters are interlinked and intertwined is nothing short of brilliant and is sure to take you by surprise if youre looking for feelgood storylines and traditionally likable characters that you can root for this show is probably not for you but if youre a sucker for social commentary witty dialogue and deeply flawed yet strangely lovable characters this is exactly the right show for you so dont listen to the bad reviews and give it a chance i for one regret listening to all the nothing happens its boring reviews so much happens in each episode if youre actively paying attention
4,a flattering soft basic im lbs and purchased the small on sale
4,im desperate for cute patterned shells to either layer or wear alone i wanted this cute print to work and it can but its just not great the material is almost spandexy which is a bit weird the only place it ran a bit small on me is the length of the straps making the neck and the arms higher than i like if i go up a size it might be too much fabric and pleated swing around the waist so close
4,i love the dress overall however found it a tad snug in the bust area overall a beautiful dress to own
4,had bought this laptop for coding and gaming i play cs dota and rdr which all run very well rdr havent tried highest settings but by default it goes to balanced preset was expecting high settings i then increased a few things in graphics and was still running very well but yet to try ultra settings anyway im hoping to be able to run gta when it comes next year overall i loved the design quality and performance and is best for the price oh also having office preinstalled is read more
4,and this coming from a lifelong trekkie i find discovery and picard great but hard work to follow this is simple classic and dollar movie entertaining keep it up mr favreau and could you ask them for k releases please
4,i love this designer and decided to give this one a try i ordered size large in black its a nice weight knit but not too heavy good for fall and winter the color is an intense saturated black thats really sharp looking i thought it split up both sides however its only split on one side and then angles across the back to the other side which isnt split and is shorter i carry weight in my midsection and this flows a bit away from the body but not in a giant oversized way i like t
4,good quality product value for money i am writing a review after days of delivery battery backup to hoursperformance is good but sometime small glitch are found
4,i love the look and design of this piece but the fit is awkward the m gapes open and is much boxier than it looks on the model but the s is too tight in the elbows i think i might have to return it
4,cute skirt and print but high waisted also was more snug so think it runs a tad small i wanted to tuck in a shirt like shown in picture but it looks goofy because the waist is so high also there is no flexibility there so size up if you want to wear it lower the models arms are covering her waist so hard to tell what proportion looks like on her im so might work better on a taller person sending back
4,so disappointing i had hopes for this as i am huge tim burton fan however the episodes seemed unresolved and me wanting to rip off wednesdays head for she was a spoiled brat that if she didnt get her way there would be hell what a pretentious little jerk i totally understand people trying to say that the character may be on the spectrum but teaching students that are actually on the spectrum they do not act like spoiled brats all i can say is beware for all the goth cosplay and teens and young people trying to act like her us elder goths are no longer get needed because of all the video recordings of us dancing at clubs that the actor can steal shame
4,i love the style the lightness and the fit but the fabric in the skirt just did not meet my expectations this might be something to find at a mass retailer i guess i simply prefer a natural fabric
4,although i want to support usa products and am so glad retailer continues to add these options i also decided to splurge with family coming home for the holidays a way to stay in pajamas but still look dressed i am only and these were just longer than capri length more like the closeup view online to get them ankle length you would have to push them way down on your hips not sure how the tall model did that i am lbs and considered exchanging the xs for an s these run
4,order a whole size down and this may work im normally a or a medium but this was huge ordered the small because i loved the colordesign hopeful
4,this sweater is wonderful for late summerearly fall or cooler weather over long sleeves the sleeves taper just below the elbow which seems slightly odd when first putting it on as though they should be a tad longer hence the stars but i quickly forget about this while wearing the sweater and it does look great
4,cheap and best laptop
4,all performances are quite good but battery backup is not satisfactory when you invest approx k on somethimg then you expect all performances to be satisfactory
4,battery is cell and all of them okbacklit keyboard not
4,use for office works
4,this top is very feminie i love hte pelats and flower details it can be however a bit boxy i think if you have wider hips i might avoid great to go with skinny pantsejans though could size down if shoulders are not too wide
4,a staff favourite at our parties it is always requested thanks for sharing the recipe
4,i may regret returning this sweater because it would be lovely had i been able to wear it as i was when i ordered it as i am in a wheelchair temporarily i find the sweater too bulky in a sitting position if you are slender and are looking for vertical lines that are slimming in a style so fashionable now this is the sweater for you the neutral colors and the bulky weave i also love because it goes with everythinga goto sweatercoat
4,i was going to return thistop i was really on the fence so glad i didnt it iscomfortable and easy to wear lace is a little restrictive but willing to over look it because i look so cute
4,i really liked this top the minute i saw it online long enough and elegant at the same time im ft tall and i like to wear my stuff loose have my back well covered i usually get ml depending on the fabric and style got this top in l this top however turned out to be larger than expected there is plenty of room on the sides and that bottom part is made of a thinner cotton material the fabric of the top is not as soft as it may look but the pullover is still very cute maybe after fe
4,i really liked the show and it was a nice change from the disappointing productions netflix has released lately jenna steals the show in my opinion and my favorite scene of all was definitely the dance one i found the song to be perfectly matching and her moves were great it did remind me of sabrina and riverdale at times but i dont mind because we are talking about different backgrounds i do hope that there will be more seasons and i believe that a second season is certain since it ended with a cliffhanger like that i would love to see more of the addams family and see how her relationship with morticia develops also i loved the thing all in all it was a great show and i am looking forward to more seasons
4,really enjoying this show characters have depth and flaws and are totally believable hope it continues and also is realeased in dvd excellent acting
4,nothing wrong with it so far definitely enjoying it going to turn it into a bootable card for emergency recoveries as well as store my device backups on it it will be my magiccomputerfixing key
4,andor is the best show since mandalorian and clone wars season seven the writing acting and world building are all phenomenal it is a great show for casuals and super fans andor is a perfect show for this time period of star wars it showcases why the empire is frightening in a compelling and mature way the mature tone is extremely refreshing in a star wars show the shows only misgiving is the name andor most casual fans arent going to care about some guy from rouge one like they care about kenobi or boba fett and it does the show such a disservice to insinuate that the show is only about andor when it is so much more than that the first two episodes are a slow build up but the payoff in episode three is well worth it and the show deserves so much more attention than its getting it really deserves a watch
4,i tried this top on with a pair of white shorts half tucked and it looked really classy and nice the fit was loose but flattering it is a tiny bit sheer but i was wearing a magenta bra so perhaps i am biased overall i think this is a good basic addition to a summer wardrobe can be worn with a nice skirt or with jeans as shown here the or xs cant remember fit me at lbs with dd chest
4,gorgeous piece although much longer than it appears to be in the photo the price however is a bit steep im not sure that im going to keep it because i just dont think it looks as expensive as it is
4,i love this show i cant miss or stop watching love the cowboys best thing on tv once you start watching you cant quit wonderful love kevin costner and the whole family everyone is tough as nails no wimps beautiful scenery and animals the actors act like theyre really related everyone can relate to that rip is so handsome and he doesnt hesitate to take care of a problem no matter what kevin costner plays in hes one of the greatest actor i know beth what can i say that girl can kick some ass luke another handsome man and hes tough too jamie is kinda a wimp start watching youll love it and be hooked
4,i thought this dress was beautiful and the quality is amazing i thought it was going to be black and gold but it has a lot of brown in it as well i ordered a petite im and the petite was just above my knees whereas the regular came below my knees this is a dress i can wear to many events
4,very nice doll for newborns and children not so young
4,the cupcakes were moist amp were liked by the crew of volunteers at the food pantry i did not like the frosting much too sweet so instead frosted them with cream cheese frosting
4,the only thing i want to say is please dont look some comments and false reviews before watching this series this series is mindblowing cast music camera works direction all amazing not even a minute was boring must watch so much hyped for second season
4,its fast i love it
4,very nice and fluffy my family loved it soft and spongy i added tablespoons of coco powder to theflour and it turned out really well thanks for such sweet recipe
4,these jeans are awesome i usually wear a in ag jeans as they tend to stretch but i ordered a p because i am only and these are a flare style i have a small waist but a larger booty and these jeans hug me in all the right places they also have a great dark color and are super classy so you can dress them up if need be the only thing i didnt like was the length even with the petite size i have to wear wedges so they dont drag on the ground but this is an issue i have with most
4,laptop is very good battery back up is best value for money in this price
4,i have used this for washing both our clothing and that of the grandchildren i have excema as does one of our grandchildren these products did not irritate our condition at all and it nice to be able to wash everyones clothing altogether rather than separately because of the excema both products smell fresh and clean although you get more washes in this pack than you do softener so you will need to buy more softener
4,its great to get a laptop so cheap in this market really great and perform well with ryzen as well
4,everything works fine except the battery it drains too fast only and half hours total sot
4,i used it on my sony as been using it for almost a month now and i have yet to encounter any problem
4,i need to start by saying im i think thats why i love this dress so much its not too short on me like so many it is a classic fit that is flattering on me the raw edge detail makes it a little more fun then just a strapless denim dress and the pockets are the best i love dresses with pockets they dont stick out weird or anything either the only negative which prevents the perfect star review is the bottom is fuller than i would like aline is a little misleading its defini
4,excellent product guys dont think go for it
4,this dress is adorable but it unfortunately didnt work for me i agree with the reviews that stated the fabric is very heavy
4,i ordered this top online i had been wanting an offtheshoulder top in a neutral color and when i found this one i had to have it i thought the price was great when i received it i was impressed with the quality of material it fit me a little more tightly than some of my other tops but was very satisfied with how it looked on my body i got it in a size small i do agree with others on here the shoulders were a little more difficult to keep folded downbut overalli am truly satisfi
4,i dont get all the positive comments ive watched the first three episodes and find it to be dull boring and sometimes even acting is dull i think its visually stunning certainly the best of the star wars series that are out there in that regard but theres just not that much happening after every episode i hoped ok the build up is done lets get into it but unfortunately that doesnt happen maybe its more of a drama series within the star wars world rather than an action packed series if so this might become better and more interesting moving on to the next episodes i just hope something will happen that grasps you and keeps you wanting to see more at this moment thats just not the case in my opinion
4,i see many reviews here applauding the series and comparing it with the book well maybe this series has adapted to the book pretty well hence they liked it but if like me youve not read the books this is almost a nothing show really at first it starts off pretty well and then suddenly you start feeling like its some c grade tv show with very limited budget streets are empty roads are empty neighborhoods are empty you dont see any crowds anywhere not even in the mall or restaurant its like only people live in the entire town even the police station has just people the sand characters you see everywhere in every scene over dramatic story line and is quite unrealistic we see nothing but keep hearing that person has been killed with the bad guys and that person is killed and then police chief is killed still the characters are chilling the police people are chilling over acting galore no plot low budget garbage this show could be so so much better
4,rompers are usually tough for me i am petite especially on top lbs a but have a healthy butt and hips which can make sizing difficult in this romper i tried a regular xs and found the fit very flattering the top was blousey on me but not overly so and the arm holes didnt gape which is usually an issue for me with nonpetite sizing the elastic waistband is also great as you can adjust it to hit you in a flattering spot and keep the shorts from being too short which
4,superb n light weight easy to carry
4,i bough the blue color and love it the neckline detail is fun and make you take a double take when looking at what is otherwise a relatively simple top it drapes nicely and paired nicely with dark skinny jeans and ballet flats for work im at a tech company so casual to business casual the ombre color is gorgeous the lavender is pretty too but seemed to wash me out and not fall as nicely regarding what other reviewers said yes it has a slightly vinegar smell when it came shipped b
4,one of the best one can biy in this price bracket
4,bought this top on a whim on a tops sale and am really glad i did its a nice twoinone piece that can be dressed up for the office with a blazer or down with jeans and a sweater striped portion of the shirt is a ponte stretchy material i am lbs c curvymuscular frame and the small was perfect and even roomy i dont like things too tight
4,these pants run large than the true size it is so comfortable and can be dress up or dressed down
4,i bought this laptop during the diwali bajaj finance offer for k after one month of use i can honestly say that the laptops performance design and display are wonderful however i am disappointed with two things the battery life and sound quality the camera is okay and we were able to play normal games but the battery drained in just two hours overall i think its a good value for money laptop
4,script and genre is all over the place in the first episode the following episodes are better however theres not a powerful connecting story and the characters get more annoying by the minute entertaining but some episodes are full of repetitive behaviors so it can get boring at moments disgusting characters cringe overallan awkward whodunnit with extreme personalities while vacationing
4,i saw this sweater online and had to try it i went to my local retailer to try it on and im glad i did i am usually a xs s in tops and i thought this fit best in a medium its very chunky which is what i was looking for and so soft not scratchy at all it has wide bell sleeves but thats very on trend right now i am b and it falls about an inch below the top of my jeans its not form fitting but so snugly i plan on wearing it with dark denim skinnies booties and simple jewlery
4,pro aspects of this plush for newborns musical plush but also able to reproduce the movement of breathing customizable music sounds various gaming experiences sensory and not washable in washing machine negative little padding high price above the batteries included are an aspect not a little but the big controller placed inside the plush is in my opinion too exposed being there little padding you feel too hard plastic of course we then go to feel strongly the product even for a matter of safety before giving them to a newborn or a small child we must understand if it can hurt or not risk that it is excessive to say exist but more padded would have been better
4,didnt change a thing turned out delicious next time i wont cut the potatoes too small like someone suggested
4,like others are saying the sleeve and bust are running small i found out that when i was trying the blue color one butterfly however before trying the blue one i tried the neutral color one at my local store in the same size s it fit me perfectly no issue with the sleeve and bust i dont understand why theyre different
4,i only say that this sleep top runs small because it shrinks a whole size after you wash it id recommend that you order up a size for that reason otherwise it is cute i am ordering the shorts to go with it
4,i do substitute beef broth and it could use more green peppers but it is yummy on a cold night i think that its funny that some folks substitute all of the ingredients is it still the same recipe
4,this card seems to work well enough speed and so far its working just fine good value for great quality lhb
4,this dress is adorable i found it to be true to size but i do have a small bust so perhaps that helped with the sizing issue the other reviewer encountered i love the embroidery throughout it beautifully constructed and feels lush im and the dress falls to my ankles but thats ok because it will look beautiful with heels or flats i love the dress and cant wait to wear but gave it a star rating because of the side zipper it is extremely hard to zip up past your waist because of th
4,every thing is okay but the display is a not smaller than i had expected which creates problems sometimes other wise its a fine laptop at this price i will suggest to go for display with same configuration
4,this chambray halter top is a good summer staple from cloth and stone but it is better for longer waists than mine and smaller busts fyi c broad shouldersback short waist normally i wear a m in cs and that is what i tried in this halter top oddly the overall length was okay but the armholes were very low in the m the bust area was tighter than it should have been for a easy summer top i think that this is due to the overall length of the bodice in other words the top ha
4,aside from some pacing issuesobfuscated by fantastic production values scripting acting and set designthis change of well everything in the approach to making star wars content is a unadulterated triumph no more stupid pandering and circuitous same stories no more terrible comedic timing and onefoot in the door to appeal to every demographic making it excellent in no way this is for adults and it is in part because of it probably the first actually good things to have come out of the property since empire strikes back rogue one was also good but pandering and stupid jokes with droids and crap also transgressed there too imperialism colonization oppression are all very serious things dressing it up in gloss and platitudes makes it a joke this has something real to say and it actually has serious people at every level displaying that difference in tone and approach at every aspect it is such a pleasure to consume from the very first cyberpunkaestheticesk minutes and it doesnt let go i was completely done with this franchise for years now im back in stop the fan service stop the pandering take your property seriously and direct content specific not made to appeal to onesize fits all because its crap this is proof of that lets hope they actually pay attention otherwise this will be the only thing of actual substance theyve made with the ip in literal decades
4,this dress is not only beautiful its so comfortable to wear its also very flattering i love that i can wear the dress with sandals or boots great buy
4,this dress is so light and twirly and the fabric is as airy as it is pretty sadly the fit was a bit off i am i tried on my usual sz and found the top to be saggy at the armpits but too tight at the waist seam going up to a only made for a saggier top most likely a great dress for lean or longtorsoed ladies which sadly im not
4,i wish there were colors id buy them all the white is super sheer but ill use it as a bottom layer for something
4,as a real rancher i was looking forward to a movie about ranch life etc instead we get a hokey spin on ranch life it is so bad its embarrasing i like a lot of costners work but this is a real bomb for him the rest of the cast who are these supposed writers no realistic storyline the way they handled the cattle eye roll cough cough then there is the supposed mustang who is really a quarter horse if you wish to refer to a horse as a mustang then i would suggest casting go get one so hokey and disappointing no more time wasted watching this bummer
4,this is so bad it was boring boring boring the actors are great but the choices the directing the scriptall so so bad wednesday looks like she is not having fun at all she is apparently good at everything she drinks espresso and she is also clairvoyant or something gomez who is gomez supposed to be ugly the chemistry between morticia and gomez has left the set morticia looks bored the school it was like a bad version of harry potter fester looks better than gomez the plot is boring and superficial as usual tim burton has focused on the hair and looks and missed the plot its fine because it made money anyways
4,i love wide neck offshoulder tops i think they are very flattering at first i thought the fabric was too thin but then realized since i want to wear this with a fuller party skirt its nice that ir is not too bulky i actually think it will be really cute with white jeans in the summer and great way to dress up a casual outfit
4,so first of all this is a fantastic show and one of the better new shows of the past couple of years if you couldnt already tell by my rating for some reason i really enjoyed the show through and through it is just unfortunate that some choices held back this show from perfection but i will first do the praises and talk about whats so good about the show and then ill get to the problem i have with it so first of all obviously the acting in this show from everyone except maybe for kathleen is fantastic and pedro pascal and bella ramsey are the stars of the show bella ramsey got a lot of unwarranted backlash for her being cast as ellie just because she didnt look as close to the character but she definitely proved why she was a really good choice for it the shows premise and story are nothing youve never seen before it wouldve been fairly original and fresh in especially for video games but it still tries to make itself more unique and more distant from your average zombie story which i thought worked out really well but there are still tropes and stories here you already know so nothing that groundbreaking and original here though not that this show has to be groundbreaking or anything but this show does a great job as a liveaction video game adaptation and i think its safe to say that this is the best video game adaptation to date the production is just topnotch and aside from the occasional obvious green screens and thats only if youre really zooming on it to find a flaw the visual cgi and makeup are just topnotch and i really enjoyed this aspect of the show that they didnt cut corners on the set design and makeup for the zombies and the special effects for the rundown postapocalyptic world of this show the production value is really high and the visuals are just fantastic and they dont cheap out on not showing the rundown cities and ruins the music is mostly the same pieces from the game especially the intro music which i have zero problems with and im actually glad that they kept it for the show too because its a fantastic piece but the rest are mostly licensed music which are really good choices too for the show but i dont think i noticed that much original new music for the show itself other than the finale but still no problem with it just an observation they didnt screw this video game adaptation like dozen others by ruining the world the characters and the story this show is mostly shotforshot recreation of the game at least for the more iconic scenes and i have zero problems with it they do a really great job of keeping what best worked in the game and adapting to the liveaction and adding and changing things to improve and maybe a little worsen it though i must say ive never played the game but i have watched a full walkthrough of it many years ago but my recollection of the story only extends to the intro and the ending of it so im not really reviewing this show from the perspective of someone who has played the game and knows the story well or trying to compare it overall i think everything in this show apart from the writing which ill get to it in a second is topnotch and i really enjoyed watching it and made me excited to play the remake when it comes to pc i just wish i binged this show instead of watching it weekly though because of the problem im gonna talk about now and also if you binge the show youll notice these problems and the rushedness of the story so the praising and the goods aside lets get into what i have a problem with in this show and what i think hinders the show from being greater first the second biggest problem in my opinion is neil druckmanns boner for flashbacks this guy loves his flashbacks so much that he dedicated two full episodes of this show to them he would make a whole movie and series that is just flashbacks if you gave him full control i just dont understand this guys fascination with flashbacks and why he thinks its a really good storytelling tool i dont really have much against flashbacks i dont care for them but i dont hate hate them either but when there are such big amounts of flashbacks in your story that it hurts the main storyline then i have a beef with it if youre telling a story you characterize your characters and develop them through your main storyline and plot you dont flashback every minutes so we could see what they did a couple of years ago sometimes flashbacks are a necessary tool to give your character more depth and i definitely prefer flashbacks to tell dont show but having entire hour episodes dedicated to flashbacks and then your main plotline getting minutes is not it now i think they did a great job with episode and the only problem i had with it was that it wasnt more connected to the present plotline that makes one think what was even the point and it was a filler but comparing episode to episode you can see that they actually had something in episode that they didnt have for episode they actually told a really good story in episode with good characters and great actors and it was interesting enough to warrant a whole episode but they didnt have enough material and also an interesting enough story to dedicate an entire episode to what we got in episode i dont have a problem with them flashbacking to left behind which is a dlc of the game i just think it wouldve worked better if the flashback and the main story moved sidebyside and the story didnt halt because we have to watch an hour of flashbacks now thats the problem with these kinds of flashbacks they halt the main story which is already barely developed to tell another story this leads to my biggest problem with the show which is how rushed the story is and the flashback episodes might be culprits even though i dont remember much from the game it is still obvious to me that they skipped a lot of plotlines to just do the main big events and be done with it most side characters dont even stay for two episodes they are introduced in the episode and they are killed at the end of that episode apart from some other side characters that survive two or three episodes but my point is whats the rush and whats the point of putting this much effort into the great production and set designs and makeup and all the effort they put into making the show just to rush through the story and skip on actual development this show wouldve been way better if we got more joel and ellie time and maybe not just jumping into the next plot point quickly without effective buildup and development hell i even thought i skipped an episode when i started watching the finale since everything happened so fast and they dont really convey the sense of time the last episode is so short that they couldve skipped a little from the first part of it and attached the rest to the last episode to get a longer finale since they like skipping this much and i think most of these decisions are most probably because of budget restraints and this is probably the best thing couldve come up with to compromise but then again they still couldve put all that effort and budget that went into episode which i guess was cheaper than other episodes anyway since it was all indoors and developed the main storyline more another annoying thing they do is the fakeouts well theyre not technically fakeouts but i dont know what to call the trope its when they dont show someone getting bitten until after it happens its just a cheap trick for a twist and surprise that gets old really quickly the first time it happens its great and works well for the story and characters its a great emotional gut punch the second time is whatever but doing it again and again whats the point of it if youre gonna show it seconds later and also characters not knowing theyve got bitten for some reason as if they cant feel being bitten and dont give me that adrenaline crap because they would definitely feel it if they were getting bitten in the middle of fighting i dont have a problem if they do it once or twice but doing it so much just cheapens the effect and becomes comical they deliberately refuse to show them getting bitten or react to them until the reveal it reminds of another example of this that was in moon knight which they just actually skipped action and not showed what happened literallly skipped the action even in the finale its just baffling also reminds of the uncharted movie where things just magically teleport into the thieves pockets and you have to believe they stole because the script says so even though the two people didnt even get close to each other another relatively small problem i had with the show is the character kathleen and how the shows writers try to portray her and actually the actress they chose for it since i havent seen her anywhere else before i cannot say if her acting is bad or the casting director made a mistake or she was intentionally miscast and misdirected on how to act as this character by the showrunner but i wont get into it much i think you can find many other reviews on the episodes she was in and see why people had a problem with her character other than these couple of issues i dont think i had much of a problem with the show as a whole and i enjoyed it overall and though i think with these storytelling and writing problems its probably an im still giving it a generous since they performed a miracle by not totally fking up a video game adaptation beyond recognition and actually delivered the best video game adaptation ever which is an achievement in itself
4,nice products thanks for flipkart
4,its without a sliver of a doubt the best thing to happen to star wars since well star wars or more specifically the original trilogy though in many ways its even better than that yes there i said it now do yourself something good and go and watch it if you havent already ps please dont milk this to death you got something real sweet going on here mkay be cool thanks
4,bought this sweater on sale off the website it fits perfectly nice length as some others said a little scratchy at the neck but certainly tolerable just need to wear a cami or tee underneath the collar is a nice shape fabric is a little stiffer than it looks in the photos
4,fit is okay the style of the shirt and the purple flowers are beautiful
4,it is a toy that we want to use since it is a baby because the songs are very tender and sweet it also has choice of heart beats or sounds from inside the utero it is pleasant to the touch but the apparatus inside is very large if it is not covered enough to be very soft
4,i like the action the subplots but the people the duttons are horrible little sympathy for their pain and loss except for kayce monica and tate no one cares for the innocents who die around them im in the th season my only hope is for the tribe to get their land back especially the yellowstone dutton ranch i hope jayce becomes governor hope jamie gets what he deserves like i said love the show but hate most of the people started thinking rainwater was bad but good so far for his people unfortunately its a forgone conclusion that most will not get what they deserve ill keep watching
4,i agree with the other reviewer on the slimming effect of this tunic and cant wait til the weather warms up so i can wear it im lbs and the was a perfect fit one thing i didnt notice in the images at least not the main image is that the slits on the side at the hip are pretty high not a problem but just something i hadnt noticed also for me i wasnt too sure about the color combo initially but it works in person
4,we liked the marinade i just added pineapple to it because we love pineapple chicken i added chicken breast along with the thighs
4,got the laptop it came one day before got it for on sale at the time of setup the laptop was kinda slow maybe due to first time use but then its working nicely no screen wobble while typing not even under fan or cooler its totally stable backlight is properly working speed is noicethe only problem im having is the weight because its heavy for everyday clg students every gaming laptop is heavy and sound disappointed me a lot being a music lover its a negative poin read more
4,when new hope came out i was years old and it was simply the most original and exciting thing id ever seen i fell in love for a lifetime but we are older now and weve read every book seen every film collected every lego model and rogue one was an awakening now andor brings our world to life grit and grime disney this is the future grasp it the world is grime and grit and kids are not like we were they get it more of the same andor is a revelation this whole new approach to what we all love is adding to the experience and we want to see more of all of it more of the empire on far worlds and the resistance struggling to commit insane heroism and those so desperate that in a future that offers them a new hope from their own sad existence with the empires promises of order you have broken the mould now forge a future for star wars
4,wtf happened first season was so fun action packed decent story and acting i was recommending the show to everyone i knew i was so excited for the second season and it turned out to be one of the biggest disappointments this year writing was amateurish story made zero sense we finished the season and we still cant say for sure what the whole point of it was actor who plays reacher is bigger but way slower and the crappy way the action scenes were shot made it painfully obvious also im totally okay with suspending disbelief for action driven shows but this was pushing levels of absurdity that ive rarely seen characters make sacrifices that were unnecessary the plot armor on the main cast was ridiculous and apparently reacher now has superhuman strength also there are some weird close ups of reachers face as hes delivering lines that were just strange and off putting but the biggest sins were in the dialogue repetitive drivel delivered with zero charisma or personality by the main cast by the third or fourth ep i was rolling my eyes anytime someone said details matter assumptions kill or dont mess with the special investigators none of these sound cool and it really killed my love for the show midway it felt like the writers knew that the story was stupidly hard to follow so they had several scenes where reacher and his crew literally explain the plot for the audiences benefit it was just an incredibly disappointing and frustrating watch all through the end it was so bad that i doubt ill be watching the third season
4,the design and colors on this sweater arguably make it a statement sweater it has a modified raglan type sleeve i found the sleeves to fit just fine for reference i am lbs dddd and the medium fit perfectly it is not a long sweater and with my height i wear a long tank top or cami underneath i love the way it looks
4,i used the product for days my personal experience with the laptop is overall fine it has a beautiful and immersive display with srgb and you can actually feel the difference secondly it has good sound clarity and the backlit is also good to use in a dark environment thirdly the boot speed is good but you need to tweak some settings like disabling startup apps and unnecessary services to make it even better fourthly build quality is good dont have any idea whether its metal read more
4,i was so excited for another fun white shirt this was fits the bill its cute it does run alittle boxy maybe a hair large it is also not white white has a touch of ivory still is a great top with skinny jeans received a compliment yesterday while getting coffee the lady was going online to get one for herself
4,this was pretty good i only used c of broth because of the soupy comments seemed like a good ratio i didnt detect any spiciness off of this and neither did my yr old so if you want it spicy i suggest using some seeds or some serrano chilies
4,tim burtons sense of the dark and ms ortegas surgical skill in deadpan delivery make this an explosion of smart fun escapism it is as effective at creating an alternateundiscovered reality as the harry potter series cliches approach and then are dashed lots of stereotypical characters are introduced then the cover is opened to reveal the book inside so aside from all the deliciously morose humor the mysterious monster and tension between the townies and cutters ref breaking away is the wonderful and sometimes painful interaction of the students as they themselves grow and sometimes grow together aside from the ones that die
4,star wars is slowly dying the mandalorian is a lost child in a mall crying for mommy while it goes into one store or another trying to find meaning this show used to be promising used to have a focus somewhere between luke skywalker and book of boba fett it took a detour and never returned the only people who enjoy this show are those who dont care about continuity or story or energy or anything they just like the logo and will follow it anywhere the rest of us will reward quality and punish garbage and this is garbage thankfully there are only more episodes so the misery will be over soon thank heavens this show is only instead of or or heaven help us
4,this comes as a surprise because shows usually created by netflix are mediocre but wednesday is pretty good first of all the story is interesting and makes you want to watch the whole season in one go which i did essentially but in two sittings then theres acting throughout watching a lot of shows with younger actors ive came to accept that they cannot do the same job as mature actors but this series changed my mind and i was impressed and i cant forget about the amazing music in this show from its main theme to other things all combined is a solid experience would recommend it to anyone
4,i do not see this as frumpy if you wear it with heels i think the bodice is very flattering
4,i love it but i dont at the same time sheer so sheer you can probably get away with a nude bra but not sure i tried on both colors and love them both love the shimmer i ordered btoh xxs p and xxs regulari think i would go with regular the petite seemed cropped on me so if i lift my arms hello belly so overall i would probably get this if it goes on sale color is either way but since i dont have an immediate need i passed nice turtleneck though reference
4,im and felt that it was just too short otherwise love it
4,very effective washing pods
4,laptops is awesome speed battery performance is nice delivery boy dont had patiencehe cant wait for min also first time i faced delivery problem from flipkart laptop is working very smoothly its nice one
4,i did not purchase because it was too low cut for my liking but otherwise really liked this top i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are for reference
4,i was looking for a dress that had a lot of color since i usually stick to neutrals this was out of my comfort zone but i found this one and loved it its comfortable not clingy and i can wear a regular bra bonus i wish the waist wasnt dropped but i think it worked well i plan on wearing it more in the springsummer dressing it up or down will be easy im usually a size and this fit true to size
5,if were true than the life of cowboys is not a bit a walk in the park strong will tough choices hard love all in one the conception that they hold the truth of living in such an archaic manor is a living body in this film about the cast always loved costner but this kelly reilly is a sight for sore eyes so beautiful so natural very down to earth but still the most committed to love her loyalty is the red string of her life none of the men around her could top that she is so powerful in her love and dedication that spreads that all around affecting the other women the guys sorry they exist to give her backround
5,i will be living in these this summer i couldnt find them in my local store so i was pleasantly surprised when i received my grey pair from my online order the fabric feels so comfortable with just the right amount of stretch and the cut is very complimentary to those of us with athletic thighs i was so pleased that i bought a black pair and discovered they look adorable with my tall boots and a black boxy sweater theyve already become my go to pants everyone should have a fun pair of
5,love this maxi gorgeous print flowy and romantic in my opinion runs a bit tight in the chest i sized up from my usual to an and it was perfect i am and it was floor length without tripping me up looks great on darker skin i am on the fair side winter skin and the beige color down the middle looked fleshtoned and washed me out a bit but with a tan this dress will be perfect
5,these were delicious my husband isnt usually a huge fan of fajitas he still didnt eat the onions or peppers but he ate tons of the chicken its a win in my book
5,excellent i grated fresh nutmeg on the top of the cupcakes beautiful and delicious
5,the first season was a blast the second i honestly dont remember but this third season is a complete waste of time nothing happens except everyone is constantly eating and drinking in a luxurious seaside setting looking good and having money although everything is based on suspense built throughout the whole season its still really boring and keeps you invested only because of the beautiful scenery bodies and luxury truly that is all there is i get the impression as if some dark hollywood forces somehow manage to blackmail the creators of successful shows to make this kind of garbage otherwiseno i cant understand
5,i am lbs and i got xs petite it fits beautifully and hits me a couple inches above my ankle bone as stated in my review title the material is quite heavy and great quality which helps it hang nicely cut high enough under the armholes and snug enough under the arms and across the top of my chest so the fullness at the bottom is proportional love it with my laceup espadrilles
5,this is such a cute top perfect for fall layered with a sweater
5,superb such a beautiful things
5,this sweater drapes beautifully but beware it is pretty light weight and feels more poly or nylon than wool i dont know if you could wear a top with sleeves underneath either it will probably work best with just a cami that said i love the style note the sweater is pretty long i am and normally p and the regular size came down to my knees the lp was perfect just covers my tush and has adequate room for curves
5,very comfortable im so i ordered the petite and its a perfect length no need to roll up slightly slim fit but not overly tight typically order everything online and didnt need to return ordered charcoal color which is simply a faded blackdark grey
5,bhalo khub bhalo onek kom dame payei bbd te

5,its perfect ive made this quite a few times one as a side to brunch lunch and the other as a decadent dessert when i add a vanilla lemon buttercream icing its wonderful i add a ts of almond extract and i suspend the blueberries in flour before adding them to the batter
5,i have used sandisk memory cards in the past and never had a problem with them so it is worthwhile to buy a brand name
5,i had a rating before after the th season i dropper it to first season was good it continued slow but had a nice story good cast nice cinematography good soundtrack then it got even slower episodes could be easily squeezed into one but the th seasona complete disaster a waste of time waiting for over a year for a lousy season that had no story moderate acting tons of stupid meaningless explosions no result whatsoever i wont be waiting for season and i wont watch it either

5,i love the loose vibe of this top the bold stripes are super cute i can dress this up or wear with jeans and sneakers get this top ladies
5,make no mistake this series contains a lot of action violence and drama however if youre going because of this youll likely bail out of this early and reading through some of these reviews i guarantee those rating this less than a seven have threw in the towel the first few episodes and thats a tragedy and injustice to yourself what this series really thrives on is its stellar writing incredible dialgue and incredible characters deeply written oh and brilliant casting this decade consists of truly amazing series and yet i am fully confident this is among the best you cant view this with a sprint mindset but a marathon knowing each season improves upon the last and believe me thats saying a lot once you become hooked you fall in love with many of these intriging characters and follow each of their journeys beautifully portrayed this show is profound simple as that theres endless drama beneath the surface and a world youll yearn to experience absolutely captivating and riveting believe me i am being as unbiased as possible thank me later
5,great price for a great product works great in my new samsung galaxy why anyone pays full price at the cell provider is beyond me keep up the good work amazon love you guys
5,i loved the video game and being able to see the game and book come to life in a series is amazing it pains me to write this but dialogue in season between characters was terrible and predictable at times the plot was all over the place there was no way of knowing when flashbacks happened there was zero background or character development with certain characters i love got and it would be great to see the witcher evolve into something on par with got i believe it has the potential so show writers if youre reading this please take your time writing the plot for season add more monster hunts as well please
5,used this conditioner for years others often comment when taking washing out how nice it smellsbut does not leave lingering fragrance like a perfume not chemically or overpowering like others does great job as a softener too notice when change brands or run out stars for the product but star for price consistence here on amazon as always amazon has price fluctuation for many different reasons but this particulr item ranges from to watch the price can easily buy for in shops when in stock i never buy when costs more here
5,this was so good everyone at the table was making yummy noises adults kids and toddlers all gobbled it up and went back for seconds i didnt have any leftovers will make this again for sure
5,my family loves this recipe i get asked for the recipe where ever i bring this dessert i use the whole oz package of cream cheese and cool whip instead of whipped cream
5,good product in under k

5,a thoroughly enjoyable reboot from netflix bringing the addams family to a new generation this time centering on fanfavourite wednesday fun and wellpaced the fantasy world created allows for a whole host of horror themes to be brought on screen in something palatable for a younger audience but still entertaining for those older perfectly inkeeping with previous iterations of the family this wealth of fiction within the spooky world gives so much opportunity for storylines and characters whether they be fleeting or vital to the plot whilst the plot can be fairly predictable wednesday investigating a mystery revolving around her town new school and own family it never becomes so outright obvious that it spoils the story episodes are split well each main character gets an opportunity to develop and the swift pace keeps enough excitement split up well enough ortega is an inspired casting for the titular character her ability to deliver deadpan monologues and retorts unblinkingly being absolutely perfect for the role the majority of the cast suit their roles particularly zetajones and guzmán and even though they may not be mainstays in the series their impact is felt whilst im not a fan of armisens uncle fester all of the children of whom the series is centred on plays their parts well and are more vital for the success of the show whilst costuming is great and the settings too very similar to s a series of unfortunate events style the main monster within the series has the worst special effects of all little cgi is used so this being looks a little goofy and out of place there are few large cgi moments but the involvement of this creature leads to a fairly unaesthetic fight in the final episode wednesday is befitting of its time a pleasantlymorbid modern update to the infamous addams family
5,so delicious made exactly as recipe states it was amazing the whole family loved it
5,this sweater is super soft and the metallic banding is a really nice detail the fabric could turn out to be a bit fragile though if you have a chest it may feel a bit boxier than you expect but i dont mind it for a comfy cozy soft sweater
5,this top is so cute i dont usually like crochet tops but when i saw this i just had to order it so glad i did my only complaint is that one of the button hooks broke but that can be fixed
5,this tank is well made and the top part is doubled partially so you can get away without wearing a bra if you wish im and tried on the standard xs in store because xxs was not available it was a little bit longer on me than on the model pictured the pintucked area fit well not too tight or loose and the bottom part was flowy which i dont mind i expect this top to shrink in the wash a tad which would make it perfect for me i opted for the white vs the black because i love the pi
5,i purchased this in white my normal size being a a size fit better on me i love the crisp white top with jeans and sandals so much that i just ordered the same top in the raspberry color would definitely recommend
5,this item works exactly as advertised those negative reviews for this product must be from people who mistakenly reviewed the wrong product or dont know what they have this sandisk ultra gb sdhc micro sd card is truly a class and works fine in my htc phone
5,i am a huge fan of absolutely everything tanvi kedia designs her clothing is intricate boho colorful and fits like a dream when i saw this online i had to have it it just arrived today and its everything i imagined it to be the fit is more like the studio pics and less like the first catalog pic the dress definitely has some room but it isnt quite as swingy as the catalog photo i have a lot of curves so it may be swingy on a more slender figure i ordered an xl mostly because of the s
5,im so glad i saw this in the store as the online photo does not do it justice its elegant detailed and a beautiful shade of pink it has a little silver sparkle which makes it perfect for a casual party when you want to opt out of the traditional holiday colors
5,one of our favorites just as is but being a tweaker i added a can of great northern beansyum
5,i have been using this ironing water for the past ten tears and i must say it is worth every penny i have never had an issue with my iron staining my clothes as it keeps the scaling away smell is divine as well and i highly recommend it

5,everyone should buy this product who likes to record with their dslr works great with my canon dslr great product
5,my dad made this when i was younger never really knew how he made it it is one of my favorites
5,arguably the best thing to come out of star wars postdisney the show brilliantly captures the politics of the star wars universe without resorting to the political transgressions of the real world like many other products of disney has done the production design costume design editing are all brilliantly done the acting was quality all around without any characters sticking out in a bad way season s episode and especially episode is some of the best tv ive seen this show is so good i now play niamos on loop as my workout music lol perhaps theres hope for star wars after all
5,i love anything fajita this was enjoyed by all

5,it is delightful dreamy and yes it is quite right perfect fit i wear a size and it was right on
5,this pack of bottles of laundry conditioner is really nice the scent is indeed what marketers would call fresh it smells nice but im not sure its what the sky smells of as ever with conditioner a little goes a long way but this is concentrated so you need way way less you get washes in a bottle so theres a lot of savings straight off the bat vs normal conditioner very nice good little bottles would recommend them
5,i added a chopped jalapeno texans love their heat fresh garlic and served with corn bread and had grated cheese and cilantro as toppers to add a little texmex to it very good
5,this is by far the best and easiest pie to make my whole family loves ittry freezing it for an hour and it is better as a frozen desert

5,the whole family loved this recipe
5,preinstalled os is not ubuntu and its completely command line so after purchase go for new os installation directly
5,season was ok for me not amazing or excellent but just ok unfortunately season is much worse the first two episodes are fine but then it all becomes ridiculous especially the fighting and shootout scenes the bad guys are always dumb and incompetent and cannot shoot straight while our heroic former military police can fight like bruce lee combined with jason statham never miss a target and in general are fantastic and flawless smart tough honorable and of course physically attractive the guy playing the titular character looks the part but his acting is poor hes basically a wooden plank
5,it stays on i mean off the shoulders the price is shocking love the low price but by no means id cheap really love this little beauty
5,i was a little nervous to buy these because they are such a statement piece but i love them they are so comfortable which is rare for jeans they create the optical illusion that i am a super model so i will wear them as often as possible very flattering and comfywin win
5,aaaaaaamazing tunic it was love at first sight and the detail is spot on the total weight is heavier than expected but that is due to the impeccable quality of the top
5,this card worked well with my last two smart phones and holds all my favorite music with enough extra storage for photos
5,i paid full price for these gladly the olive ones and was delighted when i was able to purchase the black on sale they are midweight soft flattering and stylish they stretch a little belt needed but not much pilcro are my goto pants and these hit it out of the park i wish they would come in a lighter weight version for warmer weather
5,thish is good product
5,very good a little on the tangy side from the italian dressing which i enjoy but if you have family members who do not just use a half a packet or less of italian dressing i usually uuse a pound roast so i just do two of ranch of brown gravy and of italian dressing in a cup of water when i thinken the juices for gravy i just add some corn starch or flour to some cold waterbefore i mixit in to the juices to avoid lumps the best part is it is so easy yet tastes so good
5,everything from the emotional callbacks the intense directing that felt so similar to the thrilling experience of playing the game in the very accurately displayed third person and the gripping accuracy of what actually happens in the game while still adding events that fed into the actual gameplay storyline made this an unbelievable start to what seems to be a great television show even if you have not played the last of us i highly recommend you start watching this show it has the potential to redeem both the videogame adaptation genre and continue to uphold the zombie horror genre in the walking deads footsteps
5,i use mine inside a dash camera which records continuously while the car is being driven no problems so far having the sd adapter included is nice
5,i doubled it to fit better in my quart slow cooker great without jalapeno peppers i used a ounce container of diced peppers amp onions from the grocery store yum
5,these are the most comfortable trousers in my whole wardrobe love them
5,display on performances out of battery backup out of charging speed out of heat management out of in this laptop every thing is top notch but battery backup little bit lower than company claim

5,this was a wonderful cake i say was since it didnt last the weekend i split the cake batter into two round inch springform pans and used a oz can of mandarin oranges all the store had at the time and it produced a moist cake that was light but paired well with the frosting i had enough frosting left over my household prefers a lightly frosted cake to do a five cup salad variation for dessert as well will make this again and again

5,nice product fast delivery
5,tts and very feminine and flattering looks same as on model love this style if you like style highly recommend armholes not too big yay
5,i bough this in the blue green color and its absolutely beautiful just as it appears online actually the shirt in general looks just like it does online its fitted up top and flowy everywhere else this may be because im fairly straightfigured its possible it would be less flattering on a bigger bust i agree with the other reviewers who say the fabric wrinkles too easily i am sometimes an xs and sometimes a s and i ordered the s in this and like how it fits note in meadow rue
5,tried this blouse on in the store and fell in love with this top i went down one size since i am a true petite they were sold out of the petite small but the regular xsmall fit perfect it is a little short so its perfect for shorter people
5,i was not in the market for a black blazer but saw this in store and had to try it on the quality of the fabric and overall aesthetic is fantastic love love love the gold buttons this will look great for work with jeans or even as a cover up over a cute dress i am a generally a size medium sometimes small and tend to fall between a and i went with the in this jacket
5,within few months number from keypd was not working however lenovo services are best came within days and replaced it not it is working fine and overall product at this price range is awesome
5,so i have just finished season and feel compelled to write a review i was hooked in season and thought it would wane in the second season as a lot of series do but was was happily surprised that the series kept getting better with each season the characters are welldrawn both male and female the acting is excellent the cast is splendid and the cinematography gets more spectacular with each season im not a huge fan of gangster films let alone series but this one has history great characters and great acting each season is devoted to a particular theme and introduces a guest character played by a charismatic sexy actor ie tom hardy adrien brody these awardwinning actors do not however overtake the main character storyline arcs but only enhance the stories and im sure youve heard about the music nick cave arctic monkeys radiohead pj harvey david bowie johnny cash to mention a few if youre into music youll be hooked at the theme song alone as a fan of the wire breaking bad the killing i have a high standard for shows this one is definitely worth your time im just curious as to why this hadnt garnered more buzz did i miss the attention it originally received do yourself a favour and watch it
5,at last someone decided lets just turn this video game into a succesful live action without acutally ruinning it just brilliant even the things they changed is so minor it doesnt effect anything even the soundtrack come on man its the same pedro pascal is just perfect for the role doing just fine bella ramsay too is a brilliant girl saying this again at last someone decided lets just turn this video game into a succesful live action without acutally ruinning it just brilliant really thankfull for hbo for this beautiful gift and at last a video game adaptation worth seeing so nostalgic
5,this dress is very flattering and tts i bought this dress for my brothers wedding at the end of june i love that it is machine washable which was the reason i chose this dress instead of another as another reviewer already mentioned it is brighter than photographed
5,the last few days i have been diligently shopping for a microsdxc card to utilize in my new smart phone i have a long term positive experience using sandisk cards i quickly became confused about the differences between the so called mobile ultra cards and the ultra cards the performance specs to my intermediate tech experience eyes were virtually the same the prices were also similar with the mobileversion slightly higher to finally resolve my confusion i contacted sandisk technical support to my surprise the mobile version is the older no longer manufactured version the ultra is the current model so i immediately bought the current ultra version which very fortunately amazon had on sale
5,this banana bread recipe is delicious i give it a star rating even though it was a bit too sweet next time ill try omitting or cup of sugar
5,good laptop with decent performance
5,this was really good i did add extra seasoning garlic powder onion powder salt and pepper
5,this show has been consistently riveting and the acting has been superb there are very few shows that can keep you constantly enthralled throughout its entirety i find myself anxiously awaiting for the next episode this show is definitely grim and can be too heavy for some i find it fascinating though and eerie how they show what religious fundamentalism could lead to if given total power and control there are fanatics in our current administration here in the us and this show doesnt seem like a far stretch to what they would do if they had total power to enforce their religious beliefs onto all citizens women are already losing rights over their own bodies by men in power inciting the bible for the reason to do so we need to watch this show as a warning of what could happen if we continue to elect christian zealots to office this idea they speak of to take back america and make america great again should be alarming everyone because its them wanting religious dominance over us watch learn and resist
5,ive made this for about years now and its become a winter staple such a easy recipe and all of my family love it thanks for a great recipe
5,waaaay too tasty it was hard for us to eat just one bar this recipe is a keeper i was going to try several banana bar recipes but this one turned out so well there is no reason to try any more thanks for sharing
5,sometimes if we as tv consumers are lucky once or twice a year we get a stranger things type show which is full of cheesy tropes cliches bad writing and huge plot holes but at least they are entertaining and make you feel something we are grateful for these blessings in the otherwise heaps of garbage however occasionally you get a show that you know you are gonna watch again two or three times in your life because it is so well crafted acted and cared about the last of us is one of those shows we are only half way through the first season but i can tell the people who make this show care so much i have every faith in what they are doing with the source material this is the best tv i have watched since about seasons of game of thrones i never recommend shows to anyone even the best stuff ever like the sopranos i dont talk to people about it because some of the storytelling can be a bit too meta for people this show i am telling every person i meet about watch this show you will love it
5,just like got writers lost the quality of the source material ended season was goodish but the ending is just so classic american stupid just makes zero sense and is up there with dexter for worst
5,this was very good both my daughter and husband loved it i did use regular lime gelatin because i couldnt find sugar free and i used regular whipped topping very easy to make
5,i made this over the holiday and guests really liked it i thought it was too rich with all the bacon and cheese next time id probably half the bacon and increase the amount of hash browns in the recipe i also used cottage cheese
5,well since gb is not enought for me i purchased this one specifically for my samsung galaxy note which by the way is far better than the iphone i have both so i can compare and i am not trolling in any casethe sandisk gb works perfectly with the note i transferred the original info from my previous gb sdcard to this in a heart beat now i have movies music everything works greatdont understand how people can rate it with a product works as described
5,i love the original addams family films and was curious whether this would be anywhere near as good and im pleasantly surprised by how brilliant it is so many shows nowadays are so predictable and cringe but this was really funny the whole way through the casting and acting was spot on love how christina ricci the og wednesday is in the show the camerawork and colour grading are excellent and the wardrobe and music are great too really enjoyed this series and want more i wouldve given stars if there were more episodes is not enough
5,this is so easy and with its dense consistency and exceptional flavor it will be a favorite for serving guests
5,lightweight slim comfortablethanks
5,best value for money product
5,i ordered this online in a m and l because i am usually one of those on the bottom i will be returning both for a s the fabric is great and a cool pattern but it runs large by far in addition to the large sizing the fabric has a decent stretch so that makes it even larger i think the small will fit well and the cut is flattering i am about and it hits below my knees similar to the model in the picture so i would definitely get this in petite if youre on the shorter side its al
5,we made this on vacation everyone loved it i changed the flavors around and made four different pies lemon strawberry orange and berry they were all very good the men like the lemon and key lime the best they didnt even know it was a healthy desserthehe i have been recommending this to everyone
5,its hard purchasing clothes online i was hesitant on this shirt wondering about the size and that it might be too plain or boring when i received it i was pleasantly surprised as its texture adds a nice bit of upscale to this basic tee if your debating on whether to choose a larger or smaller size i went with the smaller size as its a looser style and fits perfect
5,the only downside of this laptop after using it for days speaker quality is superb but the loudness is comparable to a phone speaker stars for speakers battery charging speed is excellent but battery backup is not even in balance mode battery backup is around hr due to the laptop resolution being too high x if you use this laptop at x resolution you may easily get hr of battery life stars for battery life slight heating its obviously read more
5,fast delivery good value for money

5,easy and delish the kids loved them too
5,we make this recipe frequently its a classic and guests always love it for a little more flavor i leave the seeds in the jalepeno i usually always double the recipe to feed six adults we prefer the cannellini beans because theyre larger and softer we love to serve it with cheese sour cream and tortilla chips
5,this recipe is amazing i used ground chicken and ground italian sausage about half and half and followed the recipe exactly for everything else cooking the sausage and chicken together adds lots of flavor its turnout delicious twice now i highly recommend

5,i found this top at the beginning of the summer and waited until it was on sale to snag it but honestly wish i had gotten it sooner and paid full price its perfect with navy shorts or white jeans and can dress up or dress down its a little bit short on the bottom but definitely still flattering i would recommend it to anybody looking for something to throw on for an easy outfit definitely worth the sale price
5,i was hesitant to purchase since this price is expensive for a tank but the quality and true shimmeryness are worth it it fits very well and goes with many different sweaters very happy with my purchase
5,i just loved this recipe i used green onions and used broccoli coleslaw in a package i also used the small shells and used oz of those i know i changed it up quite a bit but everything worked so well together i did not use the water chestnuts but this dish never lacked for flavor it makes so much i take it to our church dinners and any other get togethers yummy debbie in texas
5,taste just like snickers candy bar it all held together for me i put mine in freezer then took it out after about hour then cut it it cuts much smoother very cold or almost frozen

5,i made this recipe into an irish car bomb cake it was amazing i added jamison and baileys to the frosting very yummy
5,the actress abby was not what i expected but what disappointed me the most were the details at the time of entering the buildings they arrive totally clean without a pinch of snow despite the storm that was coming but the gameseries recreation is suitable for it no one expects perfection but it would be a little more congruent to have more detail i do not complain about the battle which has a lot of detail but there are points that are neglected that for the quality that max offers leaves a bad taste in the mouth likewise we just have to enjoy there are many chapters that perhaps noticed certain failures to reinforce lets have faith in max
5,its not very good its also lamentably predictable but i guess the point is that its a character study it seems to have been written forandby the nyc mediapolitics twitter types without explicitly saying so everyone from that orbit quickly divined from the interviews that the red scare podcast for example was the inspiration for the monotone exchanges between the two girls regarding the actors coolidges character seems to have been written to show off her comedic chops which granted are impressive and connie britton i thought did a bad pantomime performance the closest to a standout was murray bartlett
5,faultless i made this dish exactly the way its written and i wouldnt change a thing it was easy and delish a winner for my house and on the menu from now on cheers for sharing

5,the last of us is a gripping and emotionally charged postapocalyptic series that stands out as a truly exceptional piece of storytelling the series follows the journey of joel and ellie two survivors of a fungal pandemic that has ravaged the world and left humanity on the brink of extinction the writing is phenomenal with complex and welldeveloped characters that are both relatable and flawed the series delves deep into themes of morality survival and the human condition creating a story that is both thrilling and thoughtprovoking the acting is superb with outstanding performances from both the lead actors and supporting cast the chemistry between joel and ellie is particularly strong and the relationship that develops between them is both heartwarming and heartbreaking the production design and cinematography are also topnotch with a hauntingly beautiful and desolate world brought to life in stunning detail the score is equally impressive adding an extra layer of emotional depth to the already powerful story overall the last of us is a triumph of storytelling and an instant classic in the world of television it is a mustwatch for fans of postapocalyptic fiction and anyone looking for a powerful and emotional journey
5,perfect i wouldnt change a thing

5,i needed a tee refresher i had a good feeling about this one so ordered all three colors when they were on a promo and im not disappointed the neckline is different and works great to emphasize your favorite necklace the tee holds shape after washing and drying my favorite is the blue which i like to wear with dark wash jeans as styled on the model the white has a cream tinge to it and im able to wear it with a nude bra without looking indecent there is a cute little button detail at th
5,ive read the previous reviews about this dress and was hesitant to order it but im so happy i did i can definitely understand why certain reviews are saying that the fabric is cheap it is an extremely thin material as well as a thin lining however i think it depends on the person because neither of those things actually bother me i get hot very easily so i appreciate the fact that this dress is very thin and flowy i think its extremely comfortable and looks very cute on the zipper d
5,absolutely love this show only criticism is im not a fan of tommys love life thats the only part they ruined there other than that peaky blinders is amazing each season finale is epic and sooo tense production is definitelyyy a must watch
5,this is a very disturbing television series i did not read the book but had a general sense of the subject matter i have found that over time there are somethings that i watch in the evening which seem to come into better focus upon waking i consider myself to be broad minded and watch and read a broad spectrum of film and books there are two things which make the handmaids tale disturbing and difficult to watch the first is the collective insanity that was prewar germany up through the end of wwii and the revelation in the west of the atrocities of the holocaust the second is what has happened in the us since the last presidential election which saw donald trump win the presidency in the electoral college we not only have the lessons of the past to show that what we see unfolding in the handmaids tale is a possible outcome we also are watching in real time how the seeds of how such atrocities are planted no one should not sleep soundly after watching an episode of the handmaids tale nor should we stop watching forewarned is forearmed it is we the citizens of the great experiment in freedom that is the united states who will determine the future course of our nation and never for a moment believe that a future as depicted in the handmaids tale cant become a possibility i have learned over time that if the human mind can imagine it it can become a reality just look at the great body of speculative fiction scifi that has given birth to so much modern science and technology the same can be said for socialpolitical fiction the best example perhaps being george orwells yes this is a well crafted series in all its aspects but lets not forget that margaret atwood wrote this as a cautionary tale and cautionary tales are written for a reason as i write i am trying to quantify the horrific aspects of how the author a canadian of the source material depicts the abuse of various classes of women in this dystopian vision of america reduced to cattle chattel comes to mind but heres the the thingthe fictional world of the handmaids tale is not really too far off from the way women children and african slaves of the th th th and early th century america were actually treated the world of the handmaids tale is eerily close to the ethos of the early puritans only with ever present armed paramilitary thugs and the requisite vaderlike black suvs in some ways this tale is less about a future america than a past one one we would rather not contemplate reference jonathan edwards womens suffrage african american civil rights and rights of children are the hallmarks of social change on the cusp between the america that was and the america we wanta nation sensitive to the rights of all people regardless of gender age and color although there are signs that these abuses still occur as for the handmaids tale it is telling from the look on the faces of the commander the wife and the handmaid during the ceremony they know this is really screwed up but hey whatever it takesya gotta save humanity no matter how inhumane its become the last point i would like to make concerns our last presidential election a great many people frustrated by whatever demons haunt their minds voted for what they believed would be a better america an america somehow more suited to their needs and liking while i am aware that these souls are just exercising their right as americans to cast their vote for measure or man i asked myself just how far are some of these folks willing to go to have the change they envision many years ago i read about a study to determine how a select group of americans would feel about our constitutions bill of rights if the wording was changed but the rights preserved a majority of the test subjects were willing to throw out many of their constitutional rights simply because the language had changed i have been unable to locate the original study one other example is the revelation that many americans are willing to trade their constitutional rights in exchange for the illusion of safety from terrorism even though the united states has not been attacked or even under any real threat since as with the many disparate reviews on imdb of the handmaidens tale its all in the individuals perception what is tragedy and what is comedy

5,ridiculous so many ppl call this a star masterpiece these are the same people that think all the last seasons of walking dead are must watch yes i played the game and it was beautifully done but so much of this show didnt remind me of the game even though they were fairly faithful in following the storyline of the game thought the acting was pretty good but the entire show was very predictable and boring also wanted way more action less weak character development and a lot less flashing back and forwards the occasions they skipped ahead in time were the most interesting parts of the show too bad because the first twenty minutes of episode one were the most enjoyable and fairly mediocre from there on out
5,we used this recipe for an afterthewedding lunch for family it was wonderful

5,tried this on sunday and it was delicious the meat melted in your mouth and it had so much flavor i did however first season the roast with meat tenderizer salt pepper garlic powder and then browned it in olive oil and the put in the crockpot then poured the mixture in the fry pan scrapping up the browned bits from the bottom poured over the meat and added another cup of water cooked for hrs and it was falling apart so tender will definitely make again

5,very nice washable plush because the engine is removedmy son i loves glues cotre to sleep
5,update so my lovely wife bought me a samsung galaxy tab for fathers day and ive been loving it ever since just as other with samsung products the galaxy tab has the ability to add a microsd card to expand the memory on the device since its been over a year i decided to do some more research to see if sandisk offered anything new as of their product lineup for microsd cards from worst to best performancewise are the as followssandisksandisk ultrasandisk ultra plussandisk extremesandisk extreme plussandisk extreme pronow the difference between all of these cards are simply the speed in which you can readwrite data to the card yes the published rating of most all these cards except the sandisk regular are class uhsi but thats just a rating actual real world performance does get better with each model but with faster cards come more expensive prices since amazon doesnt carry the ultra plus model of microsd card i had to do direct comparisons between the sandisk ultra extreme and extreme plus as mentioned in my earlier review i purchased the sandisk ultra for my galaxy s my question was did i want to pay over more for a card that is faster than the one i already owned or i could pay almost double to get sandisks ndmost fastest microsd cardthe ultra works perfectly fine for my style of usage storingcapturing pictures hd video and movie playback on my phone so in the end i ended up just buying another sandisk ultra gb card i use my cell phone more than i do my tablet and if the card is good enough for my phone its good enough for my tablet i dont own a k hd camera or anything like that so i honestly didnt see a need to get one of the faster cards at this timei am now a proud owner of sandisk ultra cards and have absolutely issues with it in my samsung devices original review i havent had to buy a microsd card in a long time the last time i bought one was for my cell phone over years ago but since my cellular contract was up i knew i would have to get a newer card in addition to my new phone the samsung galaxy s reason for this is because i knew my small gb microsd card wasnt going to cut itdoing research on the galaxy s i wanted to get the best card possible that had decent capacity gb or greater this led me to find that the galaxy s supports the microsdxc class uhsi card which is the fastest possible given that class searching for that specifically on amazon gave me results of only vendors as of april that makes these microsdxc class uhs cards they are sandisk the majority samsung and lexar nobody else makes these that are sold on amazonseeing how sandisk is a pretty good name out of the ive used them the most i decided upon the sandisk because lexar was overpriced and the samsung one was overpriced as well as not eligible for amazon primebut the scary thing is that when you filter by the sandisk you literally get dozens of options all of them have different model numbers different sizes etc then theres that confusion of whats the difference between sdhc sdxcsdhc vs sdxcsdhc stand for secure digital high capacity and sdxc stands for secure digital extended capacity essentially these two cards are the same with the exception that sdhc only supports capcities up to gb and is formated with the fat file system the sdxc cards are formatted with the exfat file system if you use an sdxc card in a device it must support that file system otherwise it may not be recognizable andor you have to reformat the card to fatfat vs exfatthe differences between the two file systems means that fat has a maximum file size of gb limited by that file system exfat on the otherhand supports file sizes up to tb terabytes the only thing you need to know here really is that its possible your device doesnt support exfat if thats the case just reformat it to fat remember formatting erases all datato clarify the model numbers i i hopped over to the sandisk official webpage what i found there is that they offer two highspeed options for sandisk cards these are sandisk extreme pro and sandisk ultra sandisk extreme pro is a line that supports read speeds up to mbsec however they are sdhc only to make things worse they are currently only available in gb gb capacities since one of my requirements was to have a lot of storage i ruled these outthe remaining devices listed on amazons search were the sandisk ultra line but here confusion sets in because sandisk separates these cards to two different devices cameras mobile devices is there a real difference between the two or is this just a marketing stunt unfortunately im not sure but i do know the price difference between the two range from a couple cents to a few dollars since i wasnt sure i opted for the one specifically targeted for mobile devices just in case there is some kind of compatibility issue to find the exact model number i would go to sandisks webpage sandiskcom and compare their existing product lineup from there you get exact model numbers and you can then search amazon for these model numbers that is how i got mine sdsdquagas for speed tests i havent run any specific testing but copying gb worth of data from my pc to the card literally took just a few minutesone last note is that amazon attaches additional characters to the end for example sdsdquagaffpa vs sdsdquagua the difference between the two is that the affpa means amazon frustration free packaging other than that these are exactly the same if youre wondering what i got and want to use it in your galaxy s i got the sdsdquagua and it works like charm
5,very good i made this for a family breakfast and everyone enjoyed it i only used package of cream cheese and it was more than enough i will make this again
5,what a unique twist on the traditional cargo jacket the swing styling on this jacket is so cutenot too full you still get a nice silhouette from the front with the swing in the back this is a fresh take on this staple it will be a goto piece in my closet the quality of the material and tailoring on the jacket is wonderful as other reviewers have commented it does run large i am exchanging it for a size down i cant wait to get it in and wear it
5,a very magical music box is that win a cuteness price with me important for me you can adjust the volume well the viper makes different sounds like heart palpitations and soothing melodies it is very fluffysoft and shines also in color but not too much everything is individually adjustable the electronics are removable and the viper is washable cute cute cute
5,i am an retailer employee i immediately fell in love with this dress i tried it on and it was way to long as always with regular store sizesi am short i wanted to order but it was backordered for about a month i ordered it anyway my husband and i took a mini vacation to chicago over easter weekend and in the miracle mile store they had the dress in my petite size i was in heaven as they had an awesome petite area in the store there i purchased a petite which is the size i
5,it is amazing how much storage they can fit into such a small form factorremember mb floppy disks heck this thing is soooo small you might lose itits like pinky nail size smalland holds gb awesome
5,s is fresh and fun sharp dialog covers current social themes with wit and humor often showing the irony and contradictions of various sides while great acting especially by the hotel manager and particularly the familys teen son make the show memorable its funny and clever wrapped in an innocence i find endearing highly recommended s throws a lot of this away for a largely predictable drama with lots of hesaidshesaid between beautiful fit people in sex scenes against sumptuous backdrops what happened to fun unpredictability it seems they exchanged story taking risks for mass appeal its a bit disappointing imdb users rate s generally higher than s
5,ive made this many times great
5,its too hot here in ca to wear this yet but i cant wait for cooler weather i tried it on with skinny jeans and its darling love how its much shorter in front with the side splits and long back to cover the bum perfect for leggings nice slim but not tight fit
5,i bought these yesterday and i love them they are super comfortable and are the perfect length and size im and i tried on both the small and medium small for kicks but turns out they were a better fit the medium fit great tooalbeit a little baggy on the thigh these are now my go to pants for summer and travel i cant wait to start wearing them
5,how i did not notice this dress for weeks i do not know this is absolutely the best casual dress ive ever had the pleasure of owning and i hope my future includes acquiring the other sold out colors i was fortunate enough to buy the holly in m and taupe in mp and they both fit well and look flattering on my unproportioned body this dress goes well with many layers or on its own and is going to work for at least three seasons in my area the drape of the willa complements my over large upper
5,best build quality rocket performance good to go
5,fits nicely and made with highquality material it definitely makes you look very put together with some nice slacks for work the scarf is a very nice detail and actually doesnt look like it is a part of the shirt love
5,performance design display can play k videos smoothly battery hr depending on usage speakers decent backlit keyboard overall a great package in budget
5,it was a chilly september morning so baking was on my list the cookies are scrumptious but i didnt feel they had enough ginger so i added about tsp of ginger paste that was in my refrigerator aldi find i also use thicker coarse colored sugars in a rusty red autumn color they have the coarse sugar at tjmax or marshalls far cheaper than anyone i took them out of my convection oven when they were soft and voila the center is soft and the outer edges are crispy my house is toasty warm with the taste of home so reminiscent of my youth when my mama was baking up a storm
5,great intro the narrative is opening up i think it was a little to fast forward after the introduction most acting in the settlement is of varied quality in my opinion i had high expectations after seeing all the skyhigh reviews and i think the high rating is biased towards the fanbase of the game series the first episode is good but calling it a is quite a reach on the positive side we have a game to television adaption that finally seems to be good witcher rip pedro pascal carry the first episode and is the absolute highlight of the episode we learn to bind with his character trough the most of the first half and after that the focus gets more wide it ends with the start of a great adventure and all in all the pilot look very promising it still has a lot to proove though and as the series opens up the general review will be easier to settle the production budget good not over the top but certainly not dissapointing it could at times remind me a bit of the walking dead with some upped cgi and great tension all in all a positive experience a recommended watch
5,yummy my husband loves it i mad it twice in the last weeks
5,the photos do not do this skirt justice im so glad i picked it up in the store as i would not have given it a second look online it is soft stretchy forgiving and one of the most versatile pieces in my closet i dressed it up for an evening event and cant wait to throw it on with a tee and jean jacket love it
5,great production have enjoyed every episode so far reminds me of classic tv westerns mixed with the wide scope and variety of the star wars franchise
5,what can i say its a memory card bought for my blackberry z some months back oem quality the price was right arrived in retail packaging i recommend this seller and this product
5,it amazes me how some think their way is always the only way i grew up with a southern georgian dad and a northern canadian mom the flat dumplings versus drop dumplings fight was settled early northern drop dumplings won hands down even my soulfood loving dad admitted the flat dumplings which were like mushy noodles to me werent as tasty as the light fluffy biscuity drop dumplings made from scratch i dont know and it may be good but mom never used boxed mixes of anything

5,this is a beautifully designed jacket that everyone will love and wont want to take off i went with the gray wool i always worry about jackets that are too snug as i am busty but this fit is superb the arms are unusually long though maybe this is good for you i had a dressmaker shorten my sleeves by one inch so now its perfect for me i bought the regular medium my usual size size or medium top f i tend to wear my blazers and jackets open but its nice to know that i can but
5,this dress is beautiful i cannot begin to express how pleased i am with the design and timelessness of this dress in my mind it takes me back to the s and s more so than a flapper dress as it exudes the simplicity yet elegance of the early th century the champagne color is light and airy and it is incredibly comfortable to wear i am wearing this to a musical at the tuts theatre in two weeks with pearls
5,i thought this was very good even though it was a little too spicy for my daughter i doubled the sauce ingredients and was glad that i did
5,i needed a memory upgrade for my phone which is a galaxy s the time i got it was on sale and it has yet to fail me once it stores a good amount of media for my device and can hold a number of movies and full resolution pictures i have taken very handy for those long distance trips

5,got this going in the oven now i have made this in the past and it doesnt last long around here i use a bundt pan to cook it in and comes out great
5,none of the movies since the originals even came close to just a sliver of this show the action scenes are far more intense the cgi is sparing and used to accent the story not be the story its intelligent heartfelt creative and it lays a foundation that left me craving the star wars world thank you jon favreau part of my childhood was just restored and i have faith in the franchise for the first time since seeing jar jar binks
5,thank you sir
5,this is the absolute best blueberry bread the lemon juice and zest very nicely complements the blueberries regardless of the size of your loaf pan i suggest setting the timer to minutes then checking thereafter as minutes is too long as a starting point
5,in nature pilco fashion these jeans are amazing i wear them rolled down they have a slight boot cut but not overly i am and the bottoms fall right to my heel meaning the hem doesnt drag on the groundfinally the perfect pair of jeans they also do not stretch out and keep shape after wearin all day highly recommend although a little pricy for pilcro worth the splurge

5,tried on a size regular and it fit well felt incredibly soft and airy and is handwashable im currently or with narrow shoulders and torso somewhat longwaisted but petite from bust to shoulders i often wear a size p or in retailer dresses and tops the arm holes were a tiny bit low but not terrible a petite would have been shorter but also more of an empire waist the pink really is more of a red like the online photo great color

5,im not sure it lives up to all the hype that comfort is clearly a leading brand in the market leader and if you want to use fabric softer inspires confidence we personally only use fabric softener and on towels but this certainly did seem to lead them very soft and was a nice fragrance value for money this is an excellent product definitely better and cheaper brands some of which just dont work or smell very harsh

5,got the laptop for k at offer cons that i found are battery and speakerbattery lasts about hrs while watching moviebut it has rapid charging which charges the laptop within just minutes nbcheck for battery drain while gaming even though the laptop is charging i faced this issue while playing rdr in ultra settings the problem is with the w adapter which is not enough for this machine just ask customer support and they will send w one i had asked for replacement and they read more
5,we loved it making it for the second time because my daughter begged us to make it again
5,the show is ok but falls really short compared to the games and i cant imagine compared with the books since i havent read them netflix failed big in some aspects the most important being the representation of the huge and complex witcher universe they were looking to make the next game of thrones which seemed fine to me and they could have done it but somehow they managed to reduce this fantastic world into tiny situations especially in season its pretty dissapointing it just feels so small the characters are mostly ok but you have to ignore the progressiveinclusive netflix agenda im ok with strong female characters but not so much with putting ugly actors on purpose pretty much all of the elves are ugly af where have you seen ugly elves
5,i is a must buy
5,love this coat it fits very well im and typically wear an it is a bit broad in the shoulders like the other reviewers mention but thats part of its tailored look this gorgeous coat breaks up any boring winter outfit so happy with this purchase

5,love tanks and this one is sweet and flowy great with jeansshorts or slacks with a jacket for the office beautiful yellow floral with fun straps in the back that you can wear with a bra front neckline is cut narrow so bra straps show but with nude or plastic straps its not that big a deal
5,absolutely beautiful quality is worth iti agree with other review and also sized down from large to medium for a more fitted look the color is gorgeouslighter shade of brownso thrilled material does not contain dreaded wool lol
5,similar to the previous reviewer im also between sizes and for pencil skirts its usually the larger size that end up fitting whether this skirt runs large or maybe because it has a slight stretch my smaller size fits perfectly and seems comfortable enough to wear on a long flight or road trip the fabric is wonderful the skirt length is great for work and the styling is really nice with added detail of buttoned loops at the waist if i had one negative comment it would be an itty bit

5,this shirt is awesome i absolutely love the style of this shirt its super flowy and is a really breathable fabric ive been wearing this shirt a lot lately with printed pants the only downside is the quality of material it kind of feels like this shirt could have been made myself with a plain t shirt and some basic sewing skills it also feels like its going to start falling apart at the arm seams nonetheless i adore the shirt and will be getting a lot of use out of it this season no
5,love this top the color is very pretty great for the holidays i havent washed it yet but it says machine wash which is a plus for me

5,this color rich pattern will transition nicely into the fall season it wears well with a bare leg and will look great with opaque tights later in the season the higher waist and gathering work well on my figure
5,this coat is gorgeous the minute i saw it online i ordered as fast as i can type when it arrived it exceeded my expectations in every way the lace detail is exquisite and the fit is so flattering i have the beatrice coat of last year and i so love it and this is equally beautiful a must for retailer shoppers i ordered my usual size and it fits to perfection

5,finally some smart people got together and actually cast the perfect person as reacher alan ritchson is so perfect for this role he may struggle in other roles kind of like james gandolfini being known as tony soprano and no one else i had given up on the reacher stories ever being portrayed well on the big screen after the insulting tom cruise movies when i first saw the trailer my excitement grew but i had to temper my expectations i was still so insulted by tom cruise playing reacher that i didnt want to get my hopes up i did a little research and was happy to find out that lee child the author of the jack reacher novels had been praising ritchsons portrayal of reacher saying he nailed it child also felt that reacher would be better as a tv series because it wouldnt be rushed ill try to keep it simple and without spoilers this show blew me away if youre a fan of the punisher series on netflix it reminded me of that series in a way i loved the setting the supporting cast no outlandish plot just good storytelling i felt like i knew the characters well after a short time and more importantly i was fully invested im telling everyone i know that they should be watching this show i was also excited to learn that it was very quickly renewed for a season which is great news if youre on the fence about watching this show either as a fan of the books or not i think youll be pleased
5,i ordered two colors and was happy with them both i wear tanks under many tops in the warm weather as so many are sheer i like a layered look and having layers to peel as needed these tops are great on their own as well i recommend them to anyone wanting swing and extra length really love the fabric too
5,i absolutely love this top i bought the ivory color and i am definitely considering buying the black as well it feels true to size but i did size up only because i like my tops to fit a little generous and flowy i cant wait to wear this top all season long
5,i tried the neutral motif one on when it first came out i didnt buy but it stayed on my mind bc the colors were so pretty i got it at sale on sale and am so happy i did it is sheer but i think it would work fine in a casual setting without a tank as long as you have a skin tone bra great buy and tts

5,andor episodes quick review first off watch all three episodes backtoback together theyre more a movie setting up the series separately theyre quite short and believe it or not can be a little slow they fit better together and run better as a backtoback that being said its good its very good this is a darker more adult take on star wars with a pg rating the set pieces are spectacular and you can see immediately that its filmed in the real world with real settings and not in the volume if youre familiar with rogue one then you know why youre watching this if youre not then you need to watch it itll set the scene for a less black white version of the star wars universe which andor has so comfortably taken over with no spoilers being given here its a dark and gritty spy thriller where the good guys step over the boundary line when needs must great start after episodes
5,not only a beautiful knit but can be worn as both tunic and dress on my short frame it does not look like a sack tent when worn very soft and flattering collar is styled well and can be shaped different ways pattern and color combo is the similar to the exquisite eira dress i am and i chose the regular over petite i only wish the sleeves were longer
5,the best product
5,if you played the gameread the book you would probably enjoy it geralts voice is spot on story wise its not perfect of course but what is objective point of view amazing action scenery cgi dialog can improve and the potential is vast so dont hate on it straight away remember that people invested time and money to make this especially for us fanboys so all of you trolls out there in a parallel universe there might not even be a witcher to binge watch on netflix yours truly a guy who appreciates cinema
5,works well and is exactly as advertised i havent had any issues with the product i am enjoying the extra capacity it offers in my samsung galaxy s phone

5,theyre great i saw them featured in one of the marketing emails they looked comfortable and cute different with the leg warmer type bottom i went to the retailer near me but they didnt have them in store this was a slight disappointment because i wanted to try them on for sizing purposes but i ordered them because they were affordable in the range cute comfortable and stylish they also ended up fitting perfectly as well nice job
5,delicious i cut the recipe in half for the two of us and it was the perfect amount for our evening meal along with a warm bun i did use sharp cheddar just as a preference

5,my family and i love this recipe so easy and sooooooooo good

5,this year i was trying to opt for soft gingerbread cookies as my son just had his braces put on and cant have anything too crunchyand what would ruin the holiday mood than biting into one of your favorite cookies and damaging your bracesteeth i found this recipe and wanted to try itwow we just finished baking these for the first time about minutes ago and my family is already hooked what a great recipe
5,omg i had very high expectations and these cookies exceeded them ive never made macaroons before and my absolute favorites are sold at juliennes restaurant i made this recipe exactly as stated and they were perfect i did use parchment paper as recommended i also lightly beated the egg whites and vanilla to just blend then added them to the dry coconut mixture i used a cookie scooper that a friend gave me many years ago and the size was perfect yielding exactly cookies like the recipe states the egg whites never ran i did leave the cookies in the oven for an extra minutes until they were more golden but not burnt oh the cookie scooper measures appx measuring tablespoon i loved them and will add to my recipe keepers
5,i will also only be using this recipe from now on finally a banana bread that is moist and that i can taste the banana in added a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg and bananas hubby says instead of trying to eat the bananas before they get overripe as usual well purposefully leave them to brown just so we can have this bread as often as possible
5,this recipe it was amazing as is i doubled the sauce recipe and then added it to a crockpot for a few hours just because i ended up having people eating at different times next time i will double the recipe for a family of five even my picky kids gobbled them down the chicken just fell off the bones the sweet and sour and spices were just perfect i was worried the pepper flakes would make it too spicy but it just added the right amount of flavor my kids want me to make this again

5,suffering from mild ezyema my skin has always been sensitive and dry so im very careful when using skincare products preferring brands who use no nasties ive been a fan of simple for a while now using their moisturisers and face wipes and have just switched to using their kind to skin face wash weeks in and ive noticed my skin is more radiant and less dry than it has been with my face left feeling clean and fresh after each wash its light refreshing non perfumed and best of all kind to skin but still cleansing a great every day mild cleanser that you can introduce to your skin care regime a great product at a very affordable price range this review was collected as part of a promotion
5,really nice green blend of colors fun style but not especially figure flattering as it is a very wide peplum i still love it and goes with many outfits and as a fall jacket is a bit itchy need to wear sleeved top or dress underneath
5,i love this shirt the pictures do not do it justice intricate detail lovely
5,i have made these several times and as long as i dont over cook the chicken its delicious my husband is not as wild about the dish as i am but thats only because he prefers using chicken breasts rather thighs i serve the sauce over riced cauliflower rather than rice to save carbs and pair that with steamed broccoli for a healthy meal
5,this show has become the new got for me in that i start watching the minute it is available for streaming like and good zombie media the show is really about humanity and the choices we make in impossible situations everything about this show is excellent from the costumes the editing the camera work and of course the acting and writing to truly appreciate the show you have to play the games not watch someone play them the interactivity adds another layer of immersion which is bordering on traumatic both games for me were like schindlers list as in they were all masterpieces but the experience was too difficult to repeat this live action adaptation perfectly captures what made the games great and i believe it has much to do with involving the incredible team that made the game my hope is that this show will convince more people that games like the last of us and other games are art and among the greatest stories ever told
5,i rate this product i have used so many products in the past few years and i got to say this is my favourite productit does what it saysi would absolutely will be purchasing micelles cleansing wipes againi will recommend everyone to once try this product your money will be worth it and you wont have any regrets of buying this pack of wipes your money will be totally worth iti have already received a feed back from my friends and family when they tried it at the make over eventthey absoulutely are going to stick to using this product as this wipes are so soft on the skin and does the job this review was collected as part of a promotion

5,this top has great detailing and color does run a little big but adds to the style and movement of the tank the stitching around the bottom makes it cute for layering
5,i love meatloaf but wanted to try a different recipe my husband and i love cheese so i decided to give this one a try it is delicious but do agree there is a bit much brown sugar in it but that can be fixed thank you for the idea and love that they are mini so you can pack them in your lunch box for work and have a little hunk of meat to munch on will definitely be making this for years to come
5,not much more to say costners great and cole as well as the rest of the cast and a great story

5,i saw this jacket in a store and wanted it right then and there i bought a shirt and scarf instead but it was on my mind when i saw it on sale i grabbed it the fit is a little boxy but the length was perfect not too short the small amount of spandex is so comfortable it is versatile because the green arms can go with colored jeans well i am i can wear a med or large i bought the large it fits perfectly to layer short or long sleeves not a typical denim jacket looks great over a

5,yellowstone gets so much right it should have been and nearly was a tv masterpiece it managed to bring the western into the st century with a fresh concept and an epic family saga the cinematography was consistently stunning and if the performances were not all top notch especially in the cowboys quarters there was at least kevin costner bringing his rugged gravitas and kelly reilly making the sometimes infuriating beth consistently compelling and its here mr sheridan that we get to why yellowstone falls short of being a masterpiece despite having something worthwhile to say and a gift for epic storytelling the dutton family saga too often nosedives into cheap melodrama yeah sure bar fights and shootouts come with the genre but yellowstones action was often either insufficiently motivated or wildly overthetop when less might have been more or certainly more believable the worst of this excess is the duttons body count did anyone ever bother to count just how many corpses were tossed into that ravine just over the wyoming border the duttons dispatched enemies with barely a second thought one wonders why the montana police werent aware that there was a serial killer at large so many missing almost always in suspicious circumstances every good story deserves a little dramatic licence but the casual killings in yellowstone became increasingly implausible then dramatically counterproductive and finally ludicrous its not just wondering how this montana holocaust goes unnoticed its the more crucial question of maintaining interest and sympathy for the supposedly righteous duttons when it is increasingly obvious that they are all of them in the end coldblooded killers led by a patriarch who is a mass murderer some reviews attempt to excuse this by likening yellowstone to the sopranos but even if cowboys could also be hit men in the days of the wild west you cant really make a case for murder being so damn easy in modernday montana the point mr sheridan is that with just a little restraint here and there yellowstone could have been the masterpiece it deserved to be
5,this sweatercoat is great it super comfortable its perfect for my california winters it could be layered for colder areas this piece definitely runs large like really large i went with an xs instead of my usual small or medium it is meant to be boxy and still is but sizing down allowed for it to be more flattering id definitely say go in store and try it on youll love it
5,the slumber otter is a really great product music box and cuddly toy in one it is in use with us daily and so far we have no problems with it the motor to lift and lower the belly is of course heard when it runs but it is definitely not too loud also the sleeping melodies are very nice also as a gift really recommended
5,i love this tunic im and can wear it as a dress with bike shorts or leggings it is so soft and comfortable and i love the pink colorvery versatile my favorite thing about this piecei am a dd and havent bought a button down shirt in years until this tunic which fits over my chest and is so flattering many reviewers are saying that this tunic runs largei agree but for those of us who are busty its an opportunity to wear a cute breezy style with buttons and a collar

5,my husband and i absolutely loved this we did cut it in half because thats all the peaches we hadoriginally i was going to take the advice of other reviewers and back off on the topping especially since the peaches we had were very ripe and extremely juicy however i forgot to do that and instead just made it asis when it came out of the oven i was disappointed it was a big mess and there was definitely too much liquid i put all the leftovers in the fridge for another nightwhen i pulled them back out a couple days later i have to say that i fell in love with this dish it tastes a million times better cold and the cold actually helped it firm up it was no longer liquidy it reminded me of a delicious bread pudding almost i can understand why some people are disappointed but give this a chance asis if you dont like it then make adjustments for your next trial

5,coat is very soft and comfortable runs large usually wear an xsp could have gone with an xxsp if it came in that size the lining is very soft can wear a sweater or something heavier underneath if needed some small little pulls on outside fabric but might be part of the fabric outside fabric is very soft would not have paid full price glad it was on sale as i had been eyeing it for some time it is cute and felt like twirling when put it on
5,i purchased the red color in august after seeing it in the store it is cozy and stylishlove the coordinating pattern in the cowl neck i am and lbs and the s fit great noticed that it is now on special promotion and would advise you purchase now it is completely worth full price but if you can save and buy say a coordinating pilcro pant all the better right
5,amazing laptop you should really go for it
5,i have now made this yummy soup several times my family and coworkers all agree its a keeper
5,i doubled the recipe and made it in a xinch pan i needed to make it glutenfree so i used only gf graham crumbs increasing the amount to total both kinds of crumbs instead of hot fudge topping stirred into the chocolate layer i melted dark chocolate into some milk and stirred it into of the batter i left plain and i stirred the peanut butter into the other i layered them in the pan chocolate on bottom plain in the middle and pb on top i baked it about an hour and minutes tomorrow ill melt chocolate in milk again and put it on top as a ganache with pb cups chopped on top i used the recipe on this page to make gf pb cups i actually had some crumbs left over from doubling the recipe so i made a tiny cheesecake in a grabit dish and sampled it delicious
5,used mayo very good

5,i love this sweater the sky color is very flattering in person i love that it looks good open or closed i bought one for my mom and me i think it will be very versatile i think it runs mostly true to size possibly runs just slightly big
5,beautiful top but runs very small based on some of the reviews that i read i ordered two sizes up from my usual size and it is still a little tight in the chest and around the ribs i would like to exchange for the next size up but it is sold out in that size considering how small this blouse runs it would have been nice if retailer had ordered some extra tops in larger sizes as i am sure that many people will have to size up regardless i love the blouse and would definitely recommend it to an
5,i really enjoyed this recipe i felt that that the combination of ingrediants were great however i was not happy with the sauce itself i felt it was a little overwhelming and i am interested in other peoples comments and suggestions about the sauce i just felt it was a little too thick and too overpowering

5,very comfortable shirt washes up nicely with just a little ironing on the pleats cute detail of colored thread on buttons just a tad tight in the shoulders but not distracting no button placket chest gapping
5,theres never been anything like this before especially from disney star wars it checks all the boxs on how to make a damn good show its a must watch the acting the dialogue the choice of all the actors every episode is captivating beyond belief i dont usually write reviews but this one is definitely worth the typing lmao you dont really need to watch any previous star wars related shows or movies it does a pretty damn good job at being a show on its own without any of the lore but some of the moments in this show it would definitely help if you did i really didnt think disney had it in them to make a show but i was wrong cant wait for season
5,ive made this three times now and my family still raves about how much they love it full of flavor drives me crazy waiting for it bake i highly recommend this recipe the leftovers reheat just as tasty wonderful cold weather comfort food

5,i read some of the lee child novels with jack reacher the character in the series is dead on as opposed to tom cruise in the movie version the best part of the series is the depiction of jack reacher it is unusual for any film version of a book to cast a character so well
5,got it on th sep delivery was very smooth and the delivery executive opened the box first and the asked for the otp this laptop has another varient as well but it doesnt have oled screen and the charging is also little slower than thisi think this laptop has a great viewing angle and due to oled even if you work on it for hrs u wont have any eye pain or such i didnt get any cons till now will updateif u are planning to buying this laptop go for it i think no read more
5,creamy indeed i love the slightly sharp edge that the sour cream adds to this recipe it seems to lighten up the heaviness that mayonnaise can sometimes add to a recipe due to health issues i did not use any salt at all i used celery seed and i cut back on the sugar and to liven it up even more some cider vinegar some freshly grinded black pepper completes this tasty side dish one of our favorites during the summer i know my family is really going to enjoy this one its a keeperjanietaste of home volunteer field editor
5,love the material it is a thick cotton but it is structured enough and thick enough so that it doesnt cling to me in a bad way its like wearing a sweater my only beef with it is that the seam where the black material is stitched to the gray material creates a bump in the silhouette the black material is the same as the gray and it also has a herringbone pattern thats not really visible in the pictures i would have preferred a uniform material rather than a panel sewn in not a huge d
5,this was a fun and easy recipe they taste just like a from the store ive melted chocolate in the micorowave before and it is always a disaster but the peanut butter seemed to keep it from getting hard i as well did not add the salt and it was fine
5,this top is gorgeous in person i got the small because at pounds and a f chest you never know how a top will fit however this one is big i definitely needed the xs which is now sold out ill be taking in the sides because the arm holes show too much bra and theres a ton of extra fabric that makes it way too blouse love this shirt though and am not willing to part with it
5,this gathered jersey dress is beautiful and flows in just the right places however it runs large i normally wear a small in many retailer dresses however i ordered an xs petite in this dress based on other reviews im glad i did because it fits perfectly the dress is very flattering in the bustand the rest of the dress hangs and flows nicely this can be dressed up with statement jewelry or down depending on the occasion im happy with my purchase so much so that i bought one in

5,i recently finished season of andor and i have to say calling it anything short of a masterpiece feels unfair times been tight lately and i rarely get to watch anything but after revisiting the original star wars trilogy episodes ivvi andors second season dropped at just the right moment i quickly refreshed my memory of season with a youtube recap and dove in what i found was a whole new layer of storytelling within the star wars universe no jedi no aliens not even a whisper of vader instead andor focuses on the raw political mechanics of a galaxy slipping under the grip of imperial oppression the parallels to certain realworld regimes are chilling and powerful what really stands out is the humanization of the empires enforcers stormtroopers arent just faceless soldiers here they have names pasts and inner conflicts it reminded me of the clone wars animated series where clones were given distinct personalities but andor takes it even further yes there are some time jumps that feel abrupt likely to bridge into rogue one but its a small price to pay for such rich worldbuilding and emotional depth it recontextualizes the events of episode iv in fascinating ways in fact watching andor rogue one a new hope episode iv creates a seamless powerful arc even for those unfamiliar with star wars lore highly recommended for fans and newcomers alike final verdict kyber crystals out of
5,this jumpsuit is great i recently had a baby and am still trying to get the last lbs of baby weight off and this jumpsuit is very forgiving and super comfortable im usually a medium i wasnt sure if i should size up i ordered the medium and it was the right choice great light material for summer and nice neckline

5,as usual sandisk does not disappoint the speed is incredible as is the price although you can get a variety of different manufacturers none are as reliable as this one
5,this looks great with the pilcro lace bottom white jeans i bought the yellow and blue and it is flattering on longer in the back i love the style of the sleeves very flattering style and fun flirty and feminine slightly see through depending on your modesty level a nude bra may be just fine or else a nude cami a really fresh look for summer i do not think it looks cheap i do think it is overpriced but i have a hard time finding tops that hit me at the right length in front and are not

5,absolutely amazing my family and especially my inlaws scarfed this down mind you my inlaws are and years old ive made a mexican variation of this recipe i subd diced green chiles for olives and mushrooms cream of chicken for cream of mushroom taco seasoning for oregano and mozzarella for parmesan cheese i cooked the pasta al dente in water with tbsp low sodium chicken boullion tbsp onion powder a pinch of kosher salt never table salt for cooking and tbsp olive oil i used can of the noodle broth to dilute the cream of chicken soup the hot water helped blend the soup quickly and evenlyplus the water was already flavored this is a definite make again hot dish bon appetite

5,family loved it
5,these are such quirky pants theyre a lot of fun well made and i love the wide cropped legs they do run small though most reviewers say they are true to size i wear a or and in these i had to get a size very tight at the waist even though the rest of the pant flows easily and is loose great color theyll be perfect for spring and fall and you can probably pair with boots in the winter just a fun staple to my wardrobe
5,i love these jeans they are very comfortable and do not stretch excessively after wear i found the cut to be very flattering and the material to be heavy enough to hold its shape while still having enough give to move around and chase after little ones they look great paired with a vneck and flats or cute blouses and heels a great buy like another reviewer i too found these ran a little small and went up a size

5,best pot pie recipe i have ever found made this last night for sunday family dinner and everyone raved about it one pie fed adults and small children only changes i made to recipe were omitting the thyme picky kids and adding cup half and half in with milk delicious will make this again and again
5,only episodes into the series at this point and the only thing that saves this from being a is the acting this belongs on a list of a few moviesseries in my humble opinion in which i sympathize as much with the protagonist as the antagonist this could be a sign of genius on the part of the writers but in some cases as it is with andor it just results in one thought in my head as i watch the mindnumbing plot detail can i just watch rogue one ill continue to suffer through and perhaps i will have the pleasure to post a more favorable review i am not all that optimistic however we shall see
5,this is such a good dessert and so easy to put together great for summer
5,soft and feminine pretty pastel colors very romantic the fit is flattering and feminine the fabric is light the lining is soft color is pale and i may need a little brighter colors but i might let that pass i am on the fence only based on color otherwise gorgeous dress the fit me well but the back touched the ground so i would probably order petite front is higher so no issue there dd in waist lbs for reference with

5,i found this recipe september its december th and im making it for the rd time the first time i made it my mom had some and loved it and has made it probably times since she tried it my wife whom doesnt really care for chili loves it its really one of those things that sounds strange in your head chili with chicken hrm i dunno just try it it makes you nervous to try it because it seems odd but once you try it its awesome no one in my family are huge onion people so i always get a small onion and probably only use of it and i chop them up really tiny this way the onions are not overpowering but i think it would be missing something without them so i wouldnt leave them out

5,i got this in the floral print before it sold out and i have never received so many compliments on a dress it hangs so nicely and is so flattering the neckline doesnt bother me at all i know some reviewers mentioned that but i am a very small busted woman so maybe it has something to do with that i find it super comfortable like wearing a nightgown i am so in love with this dress i just ordered it again in black it will be a summer staple i found it runs true to size im p
5,i made this cake and brought it into the office along with the sauce which reheats in the microwave beautifully and a can of whipped topping the cake was inhaled by my coworkers in what seemed like a matter of minutes ive made it using a combination of tart and sweet apples when that was all i had on hand and it turned out just as well what an awesome recipe
5,this sweater is the reason i shop at retailer unique cute comfy the yellow really isnt one of my colors but its so different that i had to get it and the cut is so flattering that i had to go back to get the purple it may run a tad bit generously im lbs d and originally got the small i wound up returning and getting the xs that sizing was slightly more formfitting without being clingywe had a hint of fall weather in colorado so i immediately threw the yellow versi

5,my grandkids that dont like fruit salads loved this thanks you its great
5,i purchased this lovely blouse to go with slim cropped stretchy pants good for bum coverage while still looking sleek and tailored i purchased the medium instead of small as this is a true fitted button up style and i wanted to avoid the gaping at bust the arm holes are fitted nicely as well no bra exposure looks very nice on on point for sure for reference im dd ruler shaped figurenarrow shoulders and usually a small or medium at retailer
5,first season wasnt great but seconds goes far bellow that its way too stretch all that hourlong episodes with just a few scenes each could easily fit into or it feels like its a filler nothing is happening until very last episode casting is below any mean many actors do not look slavic even a bit
5,my kids have texture issues so we grind down the oats to a flour and they love this recipe a new family favorite
5,i have been making these bars for about years and my family and friends love them the only difference in my recipe is that i add c chopped walnuts to the batter and instead of the cream cheese frosting i make orange frosting t melted butter c powdered sugar t grated orange peel and enough juice from one orange for spreading consistency both are good my family just prefers the fresh orange flavor

5,and does what is says it will what else can really be said about memory cards they either work or not
5,i fell in love with this dress when i saw it in the catalog and ordered it immediately i was a bit disappointed that the dress is a little lighter than the pink showed in the catalog but it didnt deter my liking it because its still a lovely shade of pink the fabric takes a bit getting used to though i thought it would be silkier but its really a thicker fabric i ordered a size small and i usually wear size the dress drowned me so i returned it for an xs which fit me beautifully so
5,i really love this top they show its as a bathing suit cover up in the pics but i will wear mine as a top over a cami its beautiful and looks expensive it is had to exchange my usual size for one smaller
5,yellowstone season yellowstones character john dutton i believe is the most perfectly matched role kevin costner has ever played i almost feel like if he could have chose a life as a second alternative to being a movie star he would of chosen to be john dutton even with all the pain that hes endured through life yellowstone for me conjures that excitement of peering into a world im not apart of like watching the classic night time soaps like dallas dynasty the only difference is yellowstone is the night time soap for tough guys that women will enjoy just as much the characters are phenomenal with so many different angles at play the power shifting between the native reservation the ranch the law and the political pundits creates a vast storyline thats very entertaining to watch play out of course with a big production like this its not surprising the acting music videography and beautiful landscapes leaves you in awe everytime you watch but nothings ever guaranteed just because a big pile of money is behind something doesnt mean it will succeed but viewers have shown praise and appreciation for a show that provides a pretty big bang for every single buck yellowstone hands down is one of my favorite shows
5,i purchased this laptop on th aug only and i think its a great buy give very luxurious vibesslim aluminium body got for k compact laptop easy to carry

5,lately retailer tees have been misses for me but i was intrigued by the reviewers comments about the shaping of the tee to enhance the illusion of a waistline that drew me in because i have a short waist and some shaped tees just cling there and emphasize rolls more than my waist but not this one it is more fitted along the back waist and looser in the front i generally order size large in tees as i did with this one i dont think the fit is too big because its cut not to cling anywhere i h

5,while the white version is a tad more twee this one in black is edgier more sophisticated tts for my chested broad shouldered self in a all the unique details add up to an outstanding versatile piece how it blouses out in back opaque enough to wear without a cami the scallopsi may keep both colors
5,delicious i added in thinly sliced kielbasa green onions and used garlic salt instead of table salt i also covered the top with another layer of cheese after the first hour of covered baking so when it was done there was a nice brown cheesy crust on top will definitely make this again

5,best laptop for students go for it its very light and best battery backup upto hours real honest review
5,after the end of viewing the ninth episode i think this show will become one of my all time favorites highquality drama the acting in the show is the highest class the young generation will not like it but those who have already understood what it represents will receive excellent pleasure the game of actors deserves another paragraph i especially want to emphasize the acting of jamie wess bentley although this character himself is contradictory the series is clear interesting kevin is still good and one of the few actors who continues to be invited to quality projects
5,i had this at a pot luck at work and a coworker refused to give me the recipe only thing different is she used crushed butterfingers on top and it was awesome thanks for the recipe
5,good prodact but display
5,i made the recipe with only one slight change i sliced the peaches squeezed a little lemon juice amp sprinkled sugar amp let sit for minutes i drained the juice amp added it to the water i took it over to my neighbors amp her husband started eating it out if the pan they both said it was perfect it seemed a little off pouring the syrup over itit just worked amp turned out beautifully i put the pan under it thinking it may bubble over but it didnt great use of fresh peaches
5,its a good easy to make recipe based on other reviews i only used a third of the white sugar and of the brown sugar came out great the right amount of sweetness ill make it again
5,seasons and was good and a bit closer to the books season geralt now are a baby sitter aesthetically the show feels like its taken a step backwards costumes seem worse than even in season with many quite cheaplooking season also had great establishing shotsbig overhead shots of lots of different cities and places theres a bit of that here but not much aretuza gets a few but it feels meager compared to what were used to in fantasy jaskier hes now suddenly bisexual weird flirty stuff between him and radovid the writing way too many modern turns of phrase i dont mind some of this but its constant and gets worse and then there are weird choices like geralt not killing one of the bad guys hes been trying to kill for no reason whatsoever he had a perfect opportunity to quickly lop off the bad guys head and he just runs off like obiwan and vader in obiwan kenobi so dumb the elves i just despise how they portray elves in this theyre literally just humans with pointy ears
5,this is a lovely spring blouse with a touch of linen the color and fit is exactly as on the model there is a sweet touch of trim around the waist in a steel blue i can pull the top over my head without unbuttoning it it is tts in my opinion although the buttons on the back add a nice flair they are very fine bottons and tend to unbutton on their own i just tightened the buttonholes with white thread and the problem was fixed so thats why i gave it stars for design
5,good products thanks flipkart
5,my husband and i think this is as good as the mexican restaurants in our area if not better
5,fabulous laptop in this price range
5,i made it first time the way the recipe suggests for a breakfast with my son and grandchildren it was well received the basic rescipe lends itself to variations of your choice so ive used smoke cured ham bulk breakfast sausage smoked sausages and even crabmeat and shrimp i added fresh sliced mushrooms red bellpeppers and even the long green chile peppers seeded and diced small i made fresh salsa with cilantro and served it on the side ialso made fresh biscuits with butter and honey and a fresh fruit or melon great breakfast

5,i love the fit and feel of this shirt the fit is narrow but true to size the stitching details are beautiful and make this shirt really versatile
5,i made this recipe incorporating some changes recommended by other reviewers we are just two unless our grown children come so we halved the recipe except for the rice and green peppers added onion amp garlic and sauteed them with the green pepper amp ground meat used beef broth instead of water added the rice right at the end despite the changes i am giving this as the end result is so delicious and it is so easy to make we loved it and the leftovers as wellnext time i will try it without brown sugar and adding some smoked paprika for a little spicier taste
5,i had ripe bannas so i used all of them in this recipe used cake flour i did not have butter milk but made my own with heavy cream and white vinegar which turned into a sour cream consistency used banna extract and vanilla omitted the nuts poured into bundt pan for some reason some of it stuck to the sides of the pan so will try loaf pan w parchment next timemade a frosting with heavy cream powder sugar pinch salt cinnamon this was a hit i will definitely use this recipe again
5,i was a bit skeptical about this lovely sweater but now that i have tried it on with a pair of skinny jeans and tall boots i am sold it is so soft and full of movement it has a very unique design the purple color is gorgeous and inviting i will enjoy this sweater all winter long i am usually a smallmedium and the medium fits a bit big but looks beautiful on the neckline does fold in and adds to the appeal

5,this is a wonderful product i have over movies on my phone not including audio and i still have gb left this is absolutely wonderful
5,tasty easy to follow recipe my family definitely approved yum delicious
5,season one was kinda cool the invincible drifter rambo is always a good start add a plausible story good chemistry in the casting and watch the hero outsmart and overpower evil but what the hell happened to all that in season two first of all the lead is ok but he doesnt have the chops for prolonged shots of his mug at the end is scenes in an effort to add tension or dramatic effect that should have already been there in the writing its uncomfortable next the exposition sequences where our four heroes all stand in a line and each take a few sentences to describe the next bunch action were about to see is mindbogglingly lazy amateur writing show me dont tell me its the number one rule finally as good as lombardozzi is and he is great im sorry were supposed to believe that he believes he can kick reachers ass maybe this was an attempt to pump up the show but its a fail i wont return unless i read somewhere that producers decided to return the original vibe which was basically a modern kung fu reacher should work alone

5,this sweater is so unique not for the faint of heart but its beautiful hubby thought pattern looked southeast asian inspired the colors are saturated vibrant love the raglan sleeves and the tweed on the sleeves and in the back the front material is slightly stiffer i feel like i have a little bit more bulk in the stomach area than i want but im willing to overlook it will be a great sweater for the holiday season wear it with a skirt jeans skinny cargos endless possibilities
5,beautiful pajama bottoms i purchased these as a special treat for myself luckily i found a review on another site stating that these run small before pirchasing no one wants tight pjs order a size up also im tall and the length is just right if you are taller you may find this style too short i havent ordered the top because im not sure of the fit but im guessing it also runs small based on the photo

5,i use thawed frozen mixed veggies instead of the carrots and celery i have also made it using cream of chicken soup instead of broth very rich and easy
5,this dress is just beautiful color fit length style stretchy fabriceverything about it seems to flatter all body types it also passes the armhole test no issues there the back closure detail adds a little something special to it i tried it on with black leggings and a black leather jacket just for fun and it looks surprisingly cute for multiseason wear is it overpriced absolutely but so is of the stuff at retailer i will be keeping it anyway though because i think its a tr
5,i started this series slowly taking days breaks between each episode but very soon i was addicted to this show and i completed the second series in a day this series has it all a brutal reality of our future it depicts the truth of our society consumed by extreme right wing politics it demands the need of feminism liberalism and equality in society it encourages the youth to be aware of the current political migration and protest while we can coming to the show its suspensful thrilling dark violent and often disturbing nothing less than amazing the strong politics inside it is what i like about this is the kind of shows i demand more because this is the reality
5,stunning cardigani love it they only had a size l on sale so i purchasedim so glad i did could have gone with a m though maybe even a s but that would be cutting it especially since im ft in lbs compliments keep coming and such a great piece to have in my closet
5,best performance and design
5,this has quickly become my favorite sweater i am thinking of getting another one in case mine wears out its comfycozy and soft love it layered over tshirts or long sleeved collared shirts and am looking forward to trying it with a dress and bare legs once its warmer out it runs kind of big im and usually a size and i got an xs the s fit too
5,rompers are my fav so im biased writing this review although they are a little tricky with the fit i definitely can say that this beauty makes my body look amazing the cut of the fabric makes for a great shape yes the first couple of buttons are tough to get on but im guessing that after a couple of wears it will get easier i got my usual size and it fit like it was made specifically for me im very happy with this purchase
5,i fell in love with these bottoms at first site i was a little worried they would not work for me because im a curvy size but to my surprise they look great i tried on the large as that is what i usually wear at retailer but i was able to size down to a medium which was great cause it minmized some of the fullness for me they are light and breezy and will be the perfect alternative from shorts which i hate they are so worth trying

5,i was looking for long vest to go with skinny jeans this is exactly what i was looking for the color is better than the pic to me the style is flattering the size is just right cant wait to wear it i strongly recommend it
5,very pretty and delicate top it is fresh and with a delicate embroidered bib style the fabric on the front is silky and the back is a blend of silk and cotton just that part the back could be a little thicker so more durability still as it is its a niece piece and good quality i find it you can wear it with dress pants for office or formal gathering and to dress up jeans and either to leave it our or tuck in since the bib is focal point you can skip any necklace and war dainty earrin
5,this soup was easy and delicious i took the advice of a couple of reviewers and made a roux of the onionbutter mixture before adding the broth there was no flour taste i used more onion than called for and also used baby bella mushroom hubby liked this soup and suggested a splash of sherry next time will definitely make again
5,i really enjoy a good gangster series this show is all that and more from the moment you start watching the series you are treated to great sound track shocking violence twists turns thrills humor flirts style and addiction if your looking for a authentic drama realistic depiction of england this is it the story evolves around the street gang from birminham peaky blinders a family trying to take over the criminal underworld each character are charismatic memorable and played by fantastic actors to help tommy was my favorite character played by cillian murphy stands out the most obviously due to being the head of the family cold ruthless sharped dress and unpredictable tommy is focused and driven with an veteran background this show is a rare gem i really enjoy the time period portrayed accurately costume designs and characters i recommend taking the time to watch this series beware it is addictive
5,beautiful dress perfect mid length dress for the colder months i tried a size regular first my normal dress size but it was a little baggy so the fit perfectly
5,it is ultimate in performance
5,i read the books and played the games and i must say its still very refreshing to watch it the story line is great the actors do an amazing job sure there is still some room for improvement but thats what we will hopefully see in season
5,seasons were the best by far seasons was still good but season was pretty much a bore which was surprising considering they had an extra year to work on it literally the last episode in season was the best i sure hope season has a lot more to it or i wont waste my time on a th season overall i have enjoyed the show more than not
5,havent made i yetbut it looks good
5,excellent bread easy and quick to make
5,i made this for mothers day years ago and my family requests this cake for every occasion now we have diabetics in our house so i used sugar free cake mix sugar free gelatin and sugar substitute and its still delicious the cake is moist and well flavoredive even used a sugar free frosting and added in chopped strawberries for the diabetics this cake is just brilliant

5,i found this skirt beautiful for year round wearing its lined and tts i usually wear a size and this fit well some might say it runs big but i like skirts to sit a bit lower on my waist and this gave me a good inches in length im and and it hit me just above the knee i paired it with the back tie embroidered top by akemi kin because the blue of the embroidery in the shirt was beautiful with the blue in the skirt it will also go with a cropped creme turtleneck i have
5,these jeans are very comfortable i really like the high waist just what i was looking for
5,i love the people here we dont worry about carbs fats etc we seem to be home cooks with a family to feed amp please common sense suggestions to make this more flavorful amp realistic serving amounts i really love you guys because we do home cooking not the modernday always healthy stuff that our families dont enjoy ive made this salad since it was in toh in amp its been a favorite with our family of eight now up to i too add oz of sharp cheddar cheese amp any garden produce we have on hand it changes a little every time i make it amp they always enjoy it
5,love this top it is a beautiful shade of blue and the buttons at the bottom add a nice touch it is light weight and not too long or wide i have other tla tops in small but the xsm worked better for me with this top
5,yummy and easy it was the perfect size to feed a large group this will be served at our home
5,there is a lot of conflicting info on the we about whether cards larger than gb work in this phone the phone specs say that it only supports up to gb i put it in formatted it and got gb of usable space which is exactly what you would expect i have been using it for weeks now and it has worked perfectly good price too
5,what started as a joke between my mom and my cousins turned into an amazing joke i made the bread today and it was delicious easy to follow and amazing taste definitely a keeper
5,this is really a lovely top but the color online is not quite what the color actually is in person this was a find in my store today and it is a little more lilac than the picture shows the cut is extremely flattering and the fabric is very soft as is the case with most one september items the one recommendation that i have for this is that because the main fabric is a soft knit the proper undergarments are really needed i tried it with a lace bra and you could see a lot the details of the
5,this dress is adorable and professional at the same time i was worried that the print would overpower me but its a nice fabric im and the petite small is perfect i dont like to wear form fitting clothing for work and this fits right for me plus its hand washable i havent worn or washed it yet but ill easily wear it to my creative professional workplace
5,love the product looks a premium prodcut at such low cost very nice product feeling so happy to use it
5,very flavorful does take awhile to prepare but its worth it
5,it is so beautiful and just as shown in the pictures very elegant i normally wear a small and it hung off me just a little
5,this series has everything a successful series needs great writing interesting characters intelligent dialogue and amazing direction and cinematography yea the last two are just perfect the actors are also excellent with some of the best performances youll ever see on tv including cillian murphy as thomas shelby paul anderson as arthur shelby and tom hardy as alfie solomons peaky blinders is if not the most unique certainly one of the most unique productions out there and im not exaggerating at all its one of those shows you will watch and never forget warning this is not the classic gangster show you may have in mind this is a poetic masterpiece
5,this sounds wonderful does anyone know if it can be put together and then frozen for later use
5,these are so good i have people over after evening church services a lot during the year and these have always been a huge hit my recipe however doesnt call for horseradish which is a good thing since i dont really care for it instead of swiss cheese i sometimes use gouda which melts so well
5,purchased this item for a lepan tc tablet all i can say is works greatokay and so i have to type more words on this review so that i can post it
5,i purchased this sandisk ultra gb microsdxc class uhs memory card with adapter for use in my samsung galaxy note i under android apparently my phone had no problem with recognition of this large sd card this makes it possible for me to save a lot of photos and videos i had some feeling its even possible for me to get the gb version to work as well on this phone to make sure that it is fully compatible i did a reformat using the phone of the sd card the phone was able to detect and utilize the full capacity with no problemoverall i am extremely satisfied with this product
5,well at first i have to say i never watched the adams family so i cant talk about any cool references to the old show i only can talk about that series its to be fair a teenseries what isnt a problem for me i liked the main actress i like her sidekicks i like the camera the music and the artdirection its also a comedy series for me that doesnt worked it just wasnt my humor but thats no problem humor is different so thats no con whats for me is a big problem is the structure their are a lot of stupid decisions made through the series some actions of the characters are forced and doesnt work for me and my biggest problem is the mystery side of the series so the howl series is about solving who is the bad guy and i see the bad guy after the second scene with himher and then watch seven episodes of ahh damit who was it is terrible for me its not really good but also not really bad i saw a lot of people having a lot of fun with the series so go ahead and try it
5,armond played by murray bartlett resonates of basil fawlty both in appearance and his hapless circumstances in his tragicomedy world where the hotel customers disturb his world and life would be so much better without them the setting is more exotic than torquay but the basis for the plot is the same with the guests living their own tangled lives within armonds crumbling empire distinct characters some with happy endings some with tragic the series hooks you in as each guest moves towards their final inevitable ending dark in many ways but with that thread of comedy prevailing throughout murray bartlett plays a true herovillain and as with his character armond and as with basil fawlty you are increasingly drawn to hoping he succeeds but fate constantly works again him very watchable very enjoyable and an easy binge watch
5,this top is perfect for a weekend casual look you will love this it fits true to size
5,i use this for my family samsung flight ii phones we have not experienced any problems the kids take a lot of pictures with their phone
5,i love this dress i was apprehensive about it at first because of the light material and boxy style turns out the material is very flattering and it hangs very well the style isnt as boxy as it seems it still flatters the figure without showing all your imperfections and it doesnt fit like a tent i am and i ordered the petite its short enough to show off you legs but not too short for being less fitting i like the balance of the short length and it looks great with heeled boo
5,i am a terrible cook and i found this to be easy and delicious i would definitely recommend it
5,as a true tv nerd i can tell ive seen it all from comedies as friends to horrors like the exorcist or fantasy as game of thrones scifi like star trekto dramas like the crown etc after all these i can say that without doubt there is absolutely nothing that matches handmaids tale the maturity of it the deepness the emotions soundtrack scenario everything every scene looks so real and flawless visuals are masterful i honestly do not have words good enough to describe this masterpiece thank you for every tear and pride and goosebumps you gave me i am a lifetime fan
5,purchased this sweater in an xs grey pattern for reference small frame and was worried it would be too overwhelming this is not the case the pattern is the perfect scale and the sweater hit just right it seems to be true to size i especially love the bracelet length turned back sleeves its a little pricey but i think it will be worth it because it is so different
5,i am lbs and purchased the petiite small the dress is very flattering and can easily be dressed up or down the fabric is a medium weight and does not cling to trouble areas
5,like pointing out its perfect my daughter washes by falling asleep with it every night
5,these pants are great the color is beautiful the fabric super soft fit is slimmer than expected but sill nice
5,love these pants super comfortable but feel high quality i am usually a size and the xs fits perfectly
5,i found that rd full was a little to much next time ill use less tastes like spice cake very moist and everyone loved them
5,best in the budget the design is just killer performance is also good for basic uses but if you want to gaming or editing in ae then i wont recommend but after best for normal use and i personally ordered this for chart analysis
5,it is the best product for freelancing and creator performance is seamless battery backup is about hours during normal usage it is value of money at k
5,i bought this top last week and absolutely love it it hides my muffin top and falls in all the right places it does not cling but is very flattering for my size body
5,its a perfect value for money product has outstanding image quality super fast performance only one cons still noticeable is charger and pc heat up significantly while charging dont know whether it is really a problem or normal
5,finally a good tv show thats made for entertainment and not social messaging and written very well halfway thru the first season and loving it hope theres more to come
5,comfort is very important to me as someone who is not a skinny girl slimming clothing is important to me this top is very pretty comfortable and can be dressed up or down it does require dry cleaning which might be a con for some people
5,i tried this recipe over the christmas holiday as a brunch item for my guests the bread disappeared quickly they requested it as a must have for next year
5,this dress is gorgeous more ivory in person the crochet is amazing i sized up from my normal s to a m only bc i wanted a loose fit and after reading reviews that it fit a little bit like a shift i wanted a bigger size but a small would have prob worked as well depends on how you want this to fit i love it i wear mine now w a cropped jean jacket and leggings soon w just sandals great transition piece bc its a slightly heavy dress but not enough to be overwhelming or hot for the summe
5,i have been making this for years as a fall and winter staple we use ground turkey and double the recipe every time i make it a little bit different and it never disappoints we love to use chicken bone broth and swap out a can of corn for a can of the beans since i double it i use cans of beans and used whatever is on hand but always keeping at least can of black beans in this freezes well and everyone loves it
5,this gets rave reviews every time i make it everyone wants the recipe ive had my kids request this for their birthday cake
5,wow i was very impressed with the texture and taste of this cake it was great served with fresh fruit and next time i may serve it with lemon curd sooo easy
5,its very nice product and got at very good price
5,i got this for my smartphone after a steep price drop pleased that it is working as expected no signs of memory failure
5,these were awesome i did however fill them with a whipped cream and vanilla pumkin spiced pudding it just added that wow factor
5,love this dressfabric is very soft and flattering i paired it with wine suede boots great material i will be able to wear it most of the year with different accessories i am fairly busty so i sometimes order an xl but read the reviews and ordered a large and was just fine great go to dress
5,i made this recipe exactly as recipe said i tasted it and it was really really good i husband wanted cauliflower soup and this was the best dont leave out the celery because that really adds a lot of flavor i am on a kick of using almond milk because its healthier than cream or half and half and it can stay in my fridge for months whereas milk products need to be used the almond milk tastes no different the only thing i noticed was that it made so little soup so my review already said the recipe as stated is very goodbut i added potatoes cooked drained and mashed with a little butter and added to the soup with cups of water and t soup base and more cup of cheesewhen i go to the work of making a soup i want more than just a couple meals for the of us
5,excellent laptop with good ips display and performance moreover can be opened with one hand easily editing my review after one month still satisfied with performance and display but there are some cons as well ist built quality is below average while opening and closing hinge makes alot of noise keyboard is average webcam quality is not good they dont hve there charger they are giving rd party charger acer really needs to improve built quality and also some internal parts they read more
5,this dress is of great quality and design the lines and the way the dress shapes your body are perfect throughout the entire dress i am short and it is a little long on me it is between my calf and my ankle but the way it flatters in the bust and waist more than makes up for it with the right shoes it is a real winner i think this dress would be flattering on every body type highly recommend
5,this is a fan favorite in our house my kids ask for it all the time its a very simple recipe with a lot of flavor the only things i do different is use a lot more mushrooms and a little bit more of the mozzarella cheese because my family loves both i love to serve this alongside some fresh steamed or roasted asparagus and smashed redskin potatoes
5,value for money build quality superb display osm camera excellent
5,i really cant say enough about them they have the perfect amount of stretch are so comfortable and they keep their shape really well i would say that you could wear them times before washing also the color is perfect they are tts and even allow for a little extra holiday weight without becoming a torture device
5,i was uncertain about purchasing this dress wow so glad that i did im and lbs i can wear a small or medium so i ordered both the small was plenty big enough wore it to a family event and received numerous compliments so different from anything else and classy with the longer length thanks for a great dress i hope that it cleans well
5,i made this for a mercy meal and it disappeared almost at once easy to make for sure i used spinach and cheese ravioli and instead of a jar of sauce i used my own roasted veggie sauce definitely a keeper
5,the best tv show in a very long time the acting was outstanding not only for the main actress playing wednesday but by everyone the support cast were so strong catherine zeta jones was well cast and was great i loved thing heidi the sirene shouted for joy when heidi wolfed out good story and well paced episodes was perfect the cinematography was excellent all the young cast have a big future in hollywood give this a go hubby was also hooked he originally thought it was just a high school bit of nonsense and was pleasantly surprised it keeps you guessing pretty close to the end and the dark humour just made it fun to watch
5,i must say i was surprised how well this turned out every lasagna recipe ive ever tried always came out on the flavorless side but this recipe did not everyone was surprised that there was cottage cheese in the lasagna which i feel helps the taste granted i had to adjust the ingredients a little since a person in my family has sensitivities to what is in italian seasoning but a pepper and onion sausage and a little extra salt and sugar did the trick with the saucedefinitely a keeper
5,exllent laptop under k
5,very good pie plus it makes two of them
5,realistically not a by any means and its not a either i rated it a based on cinematography music and acting the story itself is more of a because its dark depressing unrealistic and infuriating its slow moving and it never makes you smile or feel good for the reviewers that said this is what our world is coming to you are out of your mind maybe people upset with government and such but this is a whole different crazy messed up kinda world its way too extreme and sadistic even north korea is nowhere near as bad as gilead i wonder what kind of person comes up with this hit
5,im listening to music stored thereon i read books plays etc from the gutenberg project that are stored there i download podcasts from itunes and transfer it to my tablet it is wonderful i always expect great things from sandisk would replace it if it stopped working
5,when you buy a memory card what are you looking for additional storage higher transfer rates and good prices this card is often on amazons lightning deals and this is the second one i purchased i use it in my nokia which is my phone and camera storing mp photos needs a speedy drive and this one really works wonders the additional space is also great for storage the second one i bought for my laptop it just stays in there in lieu of an ssd because my laptop only has an gb internal drive if it were possible i would definitely install windows to it but this laptop will not boot from a memory cardbottom lineneed space problem solved gb is currently the max you can getneed faster transfer rates for a microsd card its about as fast as you can get and if you can get faster itll cost a lot morecost well wait for a lightning deal if its too much but the current price really is not bad starsadditionally the sd adapter works perfectly including the little lock switch to make it read only if you want
5,tried this recipe for christmas dinner i did make a few modifications i used pound of maine lobster meat lb of sea scallops cut in quarters and lb fresh maine shrimp i also increased the lasgana noodles to noodles abreast for a total of on a scale of to this meal was a my husband the red meat eater said it would be a toss up between my notorious prime rib meal or this new recipe it was easy to make and the flavor undescribable he even mentioned he wanted to lick his plate you will not be disappointed if you try this stars in my book
5,i was pleasantly surprised by this beautiful sweater being that its a wool blend i thought it would be itchy against my skin to my surprise it is quite the opposite very cozy and soft with plenty of wiggle room im very tall and having enough length for my arms is always a concern the sleeves are long and comfortable this sweater is quickly becoming one of my new favorite go to pieces
5,i am hearing rumors of cast changes hopefully this is not going to become reality looking forward to how the story continues based on the ending of the last episode great work you all
5,i have been making this since its a favorite for the whole family and others who have it here for dinner ask for the recipe
5,i got this sweater in navy and it is much cuter than online it is a great transition sweater and also i can see it used on cool nights at the beach i have worn in professional environment to work as well as with a tee and jeans i love it
5,i purchased this top in an antro store last week the quality is wonderful and the greenish blue color is very unique the blouse has a beautiful stretchy camsiole that is attached at the shoulders but can be removed by snaps i tooks great when worn two different ways i wore it with the campole out and it peeks through the blouse at the bottom it also looks great when the camisole is worn in my only wish is that it would come in a petite size as its a touch big at the shoulders and neckli
5,best laptop for better performance performance level is op off course battery drains at lot faster than the other laptop but comeon guys its a gaming laptop its drains battery in order to perform critical task reminds me of someone else
5,looks like an awesome product packaging was too good
5,such an adorable top very flattering despite its rather full style just be sure you get the correct size since it does indeed run quite large i normally wear a small sometimes medium i ordered both sizes to be sure but they were both too large i sized down to xs and that fit perfectly
5,so our son got his otter with months and immediately grinned he gets him during the day as a sleepmate and then draws him affectionately towards himself although it was still quite difficult for him he also lifted up to cuddle with him of course it is dangerous to let him sleep with it unattended at the age danger of suddenly child death but this is well known for all cuddly animals blankets and pillows the music is now after a month still not annoying but still really sweet however breathing is a tick too loud for me but does not bother at all when falling asleep because it is regular i just dont find it nice the staggered switch it off i find great first breathing then light then music also that the volume can be regulated is great because it is quite meh on his head many toys for babies are dangerously loud here no longer in fact he does not get any more at night we had it taken away after falling asleep anyway first because he doesnt sleep with it again
5,the show is an inferior remake of the existing games with horrible casting the makers are aggressively and unfairly targeting people making reviews and anyone with valid critisims towards the show unfortunately this is nothing new on shows released on streaming platforms the show got of to a good start thanks to the great story told in the first game but is currently loosing views and getting bad rating for obvious plot twist of the second game only positive thing i can give the show is that some scenes are presented more dynamically because the game engine has limitation on camera angles espcially during scenes that are part of the gameplay apart from this the dialogue changes and character dynamics are mostly cringe
5,these pants are uhmazing i love that they have a seam in the front of the leg and in the back of the leg i didnt notice it in the photo online but in person it stands out more and anything vertical on my petite frame is a way to go these are my new favorite pantsi wish pilcro would make this style in more colors and fabrics i wear a p or a p and im glad i got the p because its true these are tight in the leg but i think thats a good thing since cords look awful when the
5,this sweatshirt is the perfect solution to chilly mornings or evenings sundrys lightweight fleece is never too warm or cool the fit is true to size the short sleeves look even cuter rolled up once or twice i know i will be getting a lot of use from this top once early summer comes along
5,its a gb microsd card so there isnt much to say about it make sure you check that the device youd like to use this with can handle this much space it comes with an sd adapter so if you have an sd port on your computer you can use it there happily have this plugged into my galaxy spros lots of space durable little buggercons price per gb ratio is bad but considering the tech this is probably as good as itll get for a while
5,i have made this lasagna for years no other lasagna compares to this one i follow the recipe to the letter every time and it turns out perfectly every time
5,i made this for our christmas day dessert it was a hit i loved making this beautiful cake the chocolate swirls were so easy and beautiful everyone was in awe thanks for such a great cake
5,i bought this impulsively to wear to a wedding and im so glad i did it is so soft and comfy and gorgeousand has pockets its loose but really really flattering somehow i would typically get a size in a fitted dress but the medium was perfect for me
5,this is every bit as lovely as shown the shade of blue is delightful with the pintucks lace embellishments and covered buttons for me tts i bought the size b my normal size i can see where it could be a problem for bustier women because the pin tucks tightened the upper chest area and it is fitted in the shoulder area going up a size may help some but if your smaller like me it is tts i think its a wonderful rendition of a denim top this would work in any season of the year
5,this was a great deal that i would purchase again if i need another just like it my galaxy note is great for videos games and movies so it needs a lot of storage this sandisk had just the right amount of gbs and price to make this a great deal its almost filled up already so i might buy another one soon dont hesitate if youre interested in quality storage
5,i tried this on in the store and was sad that the small was a little unflattering around my mid section couldnt stop thinking about the dress though so checked reviews online from homemany said to size up i ordered a medium and it is perfect fits so nicely now and the fabric is so cozy i thought the top would be too big in a larger size but it still looks good
5,very very very good product at this price range best value for money laptop in my point of view
5,i have used this to store recorded video information from a dash camera i have had no problems so far
5,this is so wonderful everyone loves it it does tend to be sweet so feel free to cut the sugar back if you choose
5,good alround thanks
5,i was looking for a solution to consolidate all the pictures i had on my lenovo tablet comes with builtin mb and a microsd reader where i had a gb card full this was a great find and i have not moved all my files to this mb card i dont see any speed issue but did not do a formal test to check the capacity
5,this is a great alternative to a vest it does have some blue in it as the other review mentions i gave it less of a rating due to the potential for snags i am keeping it though for the sale price
5,i really liked these leggings so comfy they are so soft and the waistband is thickabout an inch wide i am a size in pants i got a size m i have a inch inseam and these came down to my ankles these leggings have textured stripes at the calf and hip
5,absolutely delicious i love this recipe this is of my favorite parts of summer coleslaw and pasta salad i never thought of putting them together this was an instant favorite in my house the only change i made was i grated fresh carrots and used fresh cabbage
5,i have had a lot of complements while wearing this dress i purchased it in the grey other reviews felt that this dress ran large i agree that it might be a little larger than other retailer purchases i have made but not by much i purchased it in small usually what i wear in dresses im very tall at mostly legs and the length is great also the neck line is perfect on me and i have a fairly average torso length i am very happy with the purchase
5,product is value for money best laptop in this price range
5,saw this in the store looked at the price tag and decided to wait for a sale got it this weekend with the off and love it thanks retailer wore it for my birthday dinner and received a ton of compliments as someone else noted it does catch on itself so take care when wearing also the slits on the side are semihigh but as my husband noted this makes it a touch sexy instead of just a tunic i went with an for this reasonyou could also wear a tank underneath and yes even on sale
5,valuables products
5,i have lot of these at work gb gb gb gb though i havent done real speed tests on these but these have been reliable all along used in music players cameras laptop sd cards these do sell at a little bit of premium because of their class tag but i would buy these any day if i need these for cameraslaptop extra storage but if you are using these for music players you are good even with class cards
5,everyone loved these i did alter them slightly instead of using cup pb with the chocolate i used tbs oil it made the chocolate very rich and creamy i also needed extra powdered sugar to get the pb to hold together and added a splash of vanilla as an afterthought a great basic and quick recipe that can be altered to fir your tastebuds

5,the subject says it all does what its supposed to do at a great price when its on sale buy it
5,bought this dress online in my usual p for a special event and liked the cut but found the area around my stomach and the bottom of the open area on the back to be a bit large this in the back created the potential problem of flapping open so that you could see down the back of the dress surprisingly they had p as well so i reordered that one and love it keep in mind that the style is very subdued and elegant especially from the front with a little bit of fun added to the back with the
5,this is an absolutely gorgeous sweater the colors are just as they appear online but the length stated for the petite version is way off i suspected as much from the picture but decided to try it anyway the petite small went down to my ankles too bad i would have loved this sweater if it were an abovetheknee or even atknee length

5,the show has gone from something so good and fun to watch to beth drama the show was epic and funny to watch but beth is dragging the show to ground that constant hate towards jamie has got too annoying in a point that every time there is a scene between them i just skip its a replay that plays over and over again in every episode beth just needs to stop being so annoying and desperate to ruin her brothers life the show has still a lot potential if they fix the things that dragging it to the ground especially the beth situation because honestly i cant stand her anymore and i think i not the only one

5,i made this soup and my husband loved it i gave my best friend a bowl to try and when her husband tasted it he made her make a pot of it the next day this is very yummy and very filling
5,its a great serie it really is but it doesnt come with its flaws the witcher starts of with geralt and you get to know him quite soon but then switches to an entirely different storyline with little to no explanation to why or what this is pretty confusing but as you watch on youll slowly see the bigger picture and everything becomes clear the action sequences are amazing but in the big scale battles it becomes clear that it isnt a big budget movie but has limits to how and what i would say that its always enjoyable with its ups and downs and i would highly recommend it
5,its a best and beautiful laptop
5,i recently noticed that my trusty black cardigan that ive had for years was getting thin in the elbows and just kind of ragged so out i went on the long journey to find the perfect cardigan with detail this cardigan fit the bill with a perfect fit and lovely texture making it not just your average sweater to go with my style cant say anything bad about it

5,whay a tremendous acting cillian murphy did hats off
5,good feature at the price product quality and features are very good
5,okso as someone who is very familiar with the games and booksi had high hopes for the show that being saidi thought that for the most part the show was entertaining i thought that henry cavill was awesome i also thought anya chalotra did a decent job as yen and was just as beautiful as she should be i did have a serious issue with a lot of the other casting that appeared to have been done for the sake of diversity when there was no need to diversify said characters how do you take a character like triss who is very specifically described in the books and the gamesand for the sake of what make her look different because why did the show creators decide that for the sake of diversitylets misappropriate an entire region for the sake of pleasing the people that would have complained about the show lacking cultural diversity makes no sense i also took serious issue with the way the way the stories were toldthe back and forth sometimes got very confusing and i lost track for a while of what was going on all in allnot too badbut lets hope the creators see some of the feedback and make some effective changes for season
5,bought it when the price was low excellent value good transfer speeds and worked on my phone camera and other devices as well

5,this is a great versatile everyday tee the fit is flattering and the material is soft and lightweight this like many retailer tops runs large under the arms i first tried the medium and although i liked the way the tee hung it gapped in my underarms there was no small in my store so i tried on the xs it still hung nicely and no underarm gap love the simple colors denim blue and gray is a great combination liked it enough to pay full price
5,i did make some alterations to this recipe first change was i used almond milk used original that is what i had on hand because i have a son highly allergic to dairy milk then the nd change is that i added about cup of a sauce to the ketchup mixture to add a little more of a kicki absolutely love the way it turned out if you need to substitute the milk because of allergies this is a great recipe

5,a good size and good price for a small camera or phone that takes micro sd memory this is fast but not hyped as aiiiighsuperspeedy because it doesnt need to be its good for all the standard usages of your average consumer photos ringtones games lightweight video etc
5,i bought this for a friend of mine to put some videos on it initially when plugged into the computer we couldnt find the storage in the directory however after finding a micro sd to usb adapterbingo worked like a charm after that install the videos plugged the card in the phone and we were off to the racesnot sure if we needed the adapter but we couldnt get the computer to recognize it we also used a linux os go figure
5,purchased this dress for a garden wedding and received so many compliments the print is very lovely and the fit was true to size i was mildly thrown off by the waffle texture of the material as it caused the dress to be a tad clingier than the picture led me to believe but it was not a deal breaker loved that it was lined and though feeling substantial was not heavy and thus comfortable in degree weather looking forward to wearing this again
5,this top looks so much better on than it does in the pictures very flattering cut and the fabric is amazingly comfortable runs true to size i got my normal xs

5,loved this recipe baked it longer than it said though and im wondering if theres a way to make it in a crock pot instead
5,the other reviewers have already adequately praised this very attractive sweater but id like to add that the sizing is large i fit perfectly into a regular small although regular medium is my usual size i am f size top the medium swamped me the shoulders and sleeves were comical and the body too big i imagine many of you are scoping out this lovely comfy piece youll want to hit the right size the first time my store didnt get the coral so i cant speak for that b

5,the shape is flattering on my postpartum body even though the material is stretchy cotton and the shirt fits well across my shoulders and chest the swing shape hides my stomach area the material doesnt seem particularly breathable so you might want to avoid wearing it in really hot humid weather but for my summers in the pacific northwest itll be fine

5,i love this item they hang flow beautifully like the weightlessness of a silk skirt the front peekaboo cut outs really make them a delight to wear show off some skin somewhat transparenti topped it off with a lightweight tunic length for modesty but the placement of the painterly design really works in my favor so i could wear them with something shorter if i choose to like the model heads turned as i walked by

5,this swimsuit fits exactly as i had hoped i purchased it in the teal dot and it is a little brighter than in the photos but i ended up liking that better it is well made with thick but not too thick lined material also i was initially worried that the deep vneck may be too deep for my liking but once i had it onit looked classic and not showy i love the suit
5,i loved it only used half the cheese and milk
5,all things are good please purchase

5,this is such a pretty dress it will look beautiful in the summer with a tan and lace up sandals for a very effortless look fits very fitted in the top and loose throughout yet still slimming i am petite about pounds and for reference i went with the xxsp it looks expensive and well made and the yellow color is stunning and cheery the yellow will look beautiful on darker skin tones as well as lighter skin tones who have a warm undertone if you are on the fence order it and you wont
5,i love these shorts they are thin lightweight and not see through however the reviews are correct i am usually a size or in shorts i am pounds and i had to size up to i was able to zip the shorts up but the fit wa a little tight the offered me the comfort of more room overall nice shorts
5,simply lovely to look at because of the fringe detail and its a joy to wear because it does not cling to my trouble spots very versatile as it can be worn and layered in many different ways i was lucky enough to buy this in petite but im sure the regular wouldve been fine looking forward to outfitting this because i got so much inspiration from instagram
5,product is very good and the performance is very very good but the screen is not so much goodbut the price is so much goodover all i like the product so much
5,i am in love with this top i saw it online and i was a bit nervous to order it because its a little pricy for a tank top and i was worried it was going to be too short on me i was so wrong the detail on the top is so beautiful and looks even better in person it hit me right at mid hip and looks so cute with jeans and sandals i sometimes get frustrated with the cut of the arms with retailer clothes because they are cut so low that you see your bra when you lift your arms but this top is
5,i absolutely love these pants i was really hesitant to try these on for fear they would look like a diaper ive always liked the look of these pants but didnt think i had the body type to pull them off being with some curves i tried them in my local retailer in the solid grey in both a medium and small i could have gone either way but the medium fit better in the he hips the draping isnt as exaggerated or bulky as it looks in the pic either so it didnt add weight to my frame the mate
5,this sweater is soft and comfortable its the perfect transition piece from summer to fall and in winter can be easily layered at its a little large and could have sized down to an extra small petite but still love it
5,i had purchased the black color of this sweater at full price and loved it so much that when i saw the burgundy color go on sale i knew i had to have it this sweater is very comfortable and elevates any look with its lace down the sleeve mock neck collar and slightly flared silhouette its so fun to find different shirts to wear underneath to get a whole new look highly recommend would have gotten all colors
5,so stunning i had to have it for my spring wardrobe fits true to size and fits well in the bust and is looser on the bottom the model weara it just as it fits on me if you have a large bust you may need to size up as the fabric isnt stretchy
5,made this recipe with two changesi used cup of sugar and cooked it in an iron skillet according to my husband it was the best cornbread he had ever eaten so moist and delicious this will be my go to recipe from now on
5,ive make this soup countless of time food day at work this soup is always requested i follow the recipe as written with the exception of adding what ever left over cheeses i have in the refrigerator along with the velveeta i am making this soup this week instead of buying the of potatoes im going to try using the cubed hash brown potatoes from the freezer section at the grocery store
5,very comfortable fit over my muscley and flabby arms very pretty
5,i am loving these new leggings and i dont even surf i just wear them to the gym and at home and to run errands with a cute tunic top etc they make me feel sunny and happy fabric is light and flexible but stays in place went running in them size is accurate i am usually a on retailer pantsskirts on jeans and the small was perfect

5,i am hooked phenomenal cast but jennifer coolidge steals the show still amazing performances all round so mysterious and quirky cant wait for season
5,i love this top the quality is excellent the blouse is lined and falls nicely i like to wear it with a pair of dark gray jeans the color is described as orange but it really has more of a bronze tone looks very rich and exotic its perfect top when you want to wear jeans but want to dress it up a bit
5,i used this recipe as a guide i had to remove the carrots as some of family do not like cooked carrots so i added corn instead i also added a tsp of worcestershire sauce and cup of red wine the alcohol cooks out leaving more of a rich flavor to the meat
5,i loved this recipe different great way to use zucchini flavors even better day and beyond enjoying to the last bite

5,was for a friend but her baby loves it when im ready i want it for my baby too
5,id been eyeing this for months loving the look but afraid itd be too young for me im i tried it on in the store and loved it with one caveat it hangs rather like a sack so i think it needs a belt for waist definition with a belt it looks great my measurements are and i wear a medium oh and contrary to what other reviewers have said i dont find that the fabric is too thin or transparent
5,i came across an article to use vaseline on acne scars and irritated skin so i tried it out never would i think to do this i would think that this would clog my pores however it did the opposite i have been using this for a month now and it is life changing my scars have visibly faded i have gone to so many dermatologist and couldnt find any product that worked this well this is a game changer my friends please try it out
5,love this dress it can be dressed up or down and its very comfortable i got the ps but could have probably fit into a pxs since the style is rather loose
5,i never faced any issues so farso good it works well with my tablet it is super fast and reliable
5,and thats about it sheridan was in soa and played the sheriff he then stole the idea from american screenwriter and producer kurt sutter the linson brothers partnered with sheridan to make this series which has become like a cartoon by the fourth season i own all seasons on dvd if you enjoy watching cowboys being branded by branding irons and beaten with them then youll get your jollies some scripts are ok but its mostly jaime duttons character who has the most interesting legal take defending the family ranch from developers who hire assassins lots of violence but also disjointed store line with characters that disappear with no explanation the scripts are geared for conservative cowboys with anger issues that think theyre smarter than the rest of the world lots of folksy philosophy and maga agenda schooling cant recommend it to respectable people
5,worth it
5,you need to see this one for your self and hang in there some parts are too slow but it was all worth it when you see season and i must say elisabeth moss is one of the best actresses alive

5,these have a perfect spice blend i never think ahead enough to marinate things so i just cut partially thawed chicken breasts and let them sit in the sauce mix just for as long as it took me to chop the vegetables worked great i also agree that lime instead of lemon juice is a wonderful swap my husband loved these
5,i purchased new samsung galaxy s phones for my wife and me we wanted to be able to take pictures and family event videos without constantly worrying about not having space on the phones the cameras on the galaxy s are wonderful but that means bigger files too these sandisk ultra gb microsdxc class uhs memory card are fast and we have not even begun to fill them up
5,saw this recipe yesterday and thought they sounded good my yearold son grabbed one this morning and declared them to be the best muffins hes ever had and hes not a muffin fan then grabbed two more hubby loved them and even though im not a banana fan i thought they were really good too

5,this thing is sooo cute really soft and i love how it breathes definitely worth it
5,i ordered the navy which is really stunning by the wayand the cream i asked my husband to choose the color for me and he asked me to keep both of them there you have it that should say it all it is a beautifully done lace with an attached camisol liner which if im not mistaken is on snaps so that you can remove it and wear your own cami if this one has a weird fit for you the navy is really pretty due to the stark contrast of two shades of blue as i said my husband saw the cream colo

5,just as breathtaking in person and in a totally comfortable soft stretch fabric im lbs b purchased the size and for comparison decided on size as the size was really tight in the chest areameant only for the tiniest the dress is long on me and ill likely get it hemmed up a bit so it hits just above the kneesbut im grateful its too long something i can fix rather than being too short
5,this will be a cardigan i will wear across all seasons if you want to layer a button down or another long sleeve shirt under it i would suggest sizing up one size as soon as i put this on it felt like it molded to me its beautiful and comfortable
5,first of all i was very doubtful when henry first got the role and i was thinking really superman but how wrong i was that the performance from henry is outstanding and i can feel that he is geralt i have read the first novel and played the witcher the witcher is such a masterpiece that immediately after finishing the game the emotion i felt was something ive never felt before felt like losing a lifelong friend but the show hasnt delivered that partly i think its based on the novel which consists of different short stories rather than one consistent story i think the writer should take more time building the characters and give more time for characters to interact with each other many things are missing from the novel and even if its not on the novel i think its worthwhile to let the characters interact and build emotion with each other because a lot of the scenes the characters are just full on emotions without blending into it and sometimes it just feels like staged not sure if its because of the writing or the acting i really hope season can take more time to build the characters and please take more time for audience to think and look at the lesser evil and greater evil choices not just full on throw it out there like its script
5,beautiful shorts make you feel like a million dollars love love love them the robe to match is also adorable

5,i cant remember when i first started watching this show and i cant even tell you what got me to watch it in the first place was it the actors and actresses was it the era was it the story i dont know but something peaked my interest i finally watched the last season probably a year after it came out because after watching the show i didnt want it to end this show is purely magnificent and different the characters are amazing and disturbing but memorable my favorites include aberama for his calm yet intimidating demeanor alfie for his humor and intimidating demeanor and isaiah for his loyalty thoughtout the show even if he had limited appearances the story main focus is pretty straightforward but dives into many different plots my favorites include season would be season due to the gritty revenge plot so many great performances from the actors and actresses and cillian murphy is expectedly the coal to this fire series
5,this dress fits really cute i actually think its cuter in person than on the site really flattering the skirt hits a few inches longer on me than it does on the model so its appropriate for work and networking functions im lbs i got the and its great

5,i love this dress as a taller longtorsoed woman the sleeves are long enough and the length is perfect the overall fit is also quite flattering but i can imagine it might not be if youre shorter the material is really lovely and luxuriouslooking for jersey it seems like it should wear well a great worktoevening option as well
5,i have been looking for a long jacket with personality for a while now i got one from retailer years ago and ive been looking for something just as great walked into the store and fell absolutely in love the fit is true to size i prefer my jackets pretty fitted the color seemed a bit rosey in the store but now that im home seems more tan and brown its not going to be super warm perfect for fall in colorado and warmer winter days its soft so soft not bulky at all if this is your s
5,i saw this in my local retailer and was blown away by how soft it was the minute i tried it on i didnt want to take it off for being a boxy cut it was surprisingly flattering i have a large chest and normally wear an xl in retailer clothes but i could easily zip the size large all the way up this is the perfect hoodie to wear running errands on the weekend or with a pretty blouse on under it at work i know ill get a ton of use out of it so i recommend it
5,this is the kind of weather i want to wrap myself up with a cozy and soft blanket but i cant really walking around with a giant bulky blanket this cardigan is as good as i can get its so soft comfy and well made nowadays most of the knitwear are made of dominantly polyester this one is mostly natural material with has a much better feel than the man made kind i like how this garment is not too bulky and not too tight warm enough for the breeze but not too thick love it

5,i put this on every night before i go to bed and when i wake up in the morning my skin feels so hydrated and plumped i love it i have sensitive skin and have struggled with eczema throughout my life but this cream has never caused me any problems i love it
5,fabulous easy recipe and i gave it stars because i copied amp printed about ten of the reviews with variations on the theme incredibly useful for the basic recipe and variations to suit my mood or the spices and meats i have on hand
5,i really dont know how this show deserves an stars rating crime story is solid ok but the overall acting is cringy and pretty artificial i would give it something around but there are too many highratings
5,easy amp yummy my husband loves this soup ive changed it up on occasion by substituting fresh green beans for spinach or add both use precooked thawed italian meatballs cut into quarters or roasted cherry tomatoes to add
5,this is my goto shirt perfect for layering perfect for around the house or perfect for topping an outfit with a scarf the white is a little sheer but its fine for me
5,the old western vibe here is obvious and could have been a good thing to sort of counter the direction of the later star wars movies it seems like this was meant to target ahem older people who are more invested in the original trilogy heres the problem the show is completely pointless each episode is basically a side quest to use video game terminology you know the kind of thing where you have to go over there and kill wolves in order to get wolf pelts just to get the npc to give you the next part of the story line no one wants to do that but youre forced to waste your time to make something short seem like something more epic entire episodes go by and you think to yourself they could have left the entire episode on the cutting room floor and that would have made no change to the overarching plot its like they had a hour plot and stretched it into episodes of pointless content if it was at least entertaining content it could be partially forgiven but it wasnt even that
5,super diplay
5,doubled this recipe for a dinner at work raves
5,theres one thing you can always be sure from disney a lot of mud dull colours cheap looking sets and poor acting from a host of bit part british tv actors so far so grey was looking forward to this show as i love rogue one but its pretty bloody gloomy and dull so far its episodes so lets hope its just a slow build to a much bigger better adventure it has the feel of a bbc drama a lot of talk limited excitement and a lot of english accents for a show set in an entire galaxy something i find really annoying as a brit i want escapism not south london it doesnt feel like star wars it doesnt feel like rogue one not sure what it feels like but time will tell is it good honestly ive no idea yet
5,camera quality is worst performance wise it is good ram slot is only one they should give slot for ram at the time of charging laptop heats so much
5,this is an easy wonderful light dessert i have made key lime raspberry and strawberry so far and plan to try more different flavors i used regular gelatin and lowfat greek yogurt and light whipped topping i didnt add all the whipped topping to the pie so i could put it on the pie along with fresh fruit when i served it delicious
5,i have made this coleslaw many times and even won our salad contest at work with this recipe its a keeper
5,i am obsessed with these shorts i bought blue ones last year and loved them so much i needed another pair i purchased the gray ones and they are a beautiful hue even with my pale legs i think they will be very versatile the fit is perfect hits at just the right length to be flattering and appropriate not too short super comfy i am fuller on the bottom so shorts are tough to find and these are truly amazing i cant wait to wear them when it gets warmer for reference i am about
5,these are gentle skinkind versions within the persil and comfort ranges the bundled pack is a practical suggestion that offers good value compared to the individual retail prices of x wash persil and x wash comfort making the fabric softener effectively free i cant remember not using persil nonbiological as my laundry detergent of choice its the brand i grew up with one that doesnt irritate the eczema and allergy prone skin of several members of my family it has a pleasant but not overly dominant scent and the fluid formulation means this can be used even on cold washes the comfort is a highly concentrated version in quite a small bottle in real life the bottle is rather smaller than the product photo makes it appear in relation to the persil but this doesnt represent poor value washes worth is washes worth regardless of the size container in which it comes and the small size does a good job of keeping the use of packaging materials down
5,this is an excellent product and left my skin feeling so clean and healthy great value for money too will definitely be using this for the foreseeable future ive tried other similar products in the past but have not gotten results as good as this this review was collected as part of a promotion
5,product and quality as well good brand is too good
5,its a little roomy but this shirt is spectacular ive gotten so many compliments on this one whether worn with jeans work pants or shorts allweather as other reviewers have said the material is sort of sleekfeeling not traditional cotton for me i love that as ive been able to wash stains out of this shirt more easily than i otherwise would i am normally a tiny tiny petite but i ended up buying this in the xs regular because the style worked even though its a bit loose
5,this small but big in memory will be the perfect gift for a samsung tableti am pretty sure she will love it
5,this is going to be my goto winter sweater for work this piece is super comfy yet a bit more dressy than just a regular sweatshirt it will be an especially great layer for the ups and downs of the office thermostat
5,if i may start offtopic for a moment i am male mid sixties and have watched like many others all the great and notsogreat horror films after watching the ten episodes of the handmaids tale i can safely say that this is a real horror story it makes the entire horror genre seem like cotton candy after each episode i find myself shaking often with tears in my eyes im not going to talk about the story i am going to tell you that the acting is beyond reproach in almost every movie every tv series there are at least one or two characters that dont fit or are poorly portrayed not so here i simply cannot find fault with the performances of the entire cast stellar the sets the direction the camera work the intensity all fit together seamlessly this is a story of a good worldgone very wrong this is a story about faith twisted by evil intent then thrust upon the common people for me it is truly horrifying im sorry i cant find better words to describe how this show affects me i will say this my daughter is currently attending university in the us and i can tell you i fear for her safety every hour of every day not because this story is happening nowbut because it is so close
5,i am always nervous when adaptions take place in all honesty every single video game adaption i have seen has been a disaster but not this one i have never been hooked on a show this early on after episode one i quickly became obsessed with this show and trusted that i wouldnt be disappointed i have noticed plenty of differences between the show and the game but i can understand why those changes were made and appreciate the differences i know many fans of the game are upset about some differences but personally i enjoy seeing new sides to the story that we didnt get to see in the game i thought episode was a great introduction to the world and liked how we learned a bit more information about the outbreak than was given in the game episode was amazing and what solidified in my mind that they made the correct choice for casting i really do see the characters i fell in love with from the game represented in the show episode was possibly the best episode of a television series i have ever seen this is probably where the show has deviated from the game the most but i am so happy they did it that way it brought so much depth to the character learning his backstory although it is different from the game i have learned to appreciate both ways a story can be told and i hope other fans can see that too
5,i disagree with reviewers who said the dress looked cheap cavernous or stiff quite the opposite i wore this to my nd anniversary dinner and two women stopped me to say i was stunning i am an average medium hourglass the dress arrived in weeks and was true to size i wore a nude lace strapless bra underneath the hem reaches the bottom of my kneecaps the lace sleeves were not tight on my fleshy arms the neckline lays flat the dress zips in back and the silver hooks in front are most
5,delicious this recipe is great and easy the only thing i had to change was the cooking time since i made it earlier in the day it had been in the refrigerator so i took longer than the minutes to cook so just make sure you adjust your cooking time if needed but a really delicious recipe
5,easy to prepare and really enjoyed the taste and texture i added ham cubes and parsle instead of bacon the hash brown werent totally thawed so i needed to bake it an additional minutes next time i want to add asparagus or spinach for added flavor and nutritional value will be part of my family recipe cookbook
5,i love this skirt its a denim material so its structured but not too heavy for warm weather the colors are bright it may run a bit big but i didnt have trouble with my usual size the pockets are actually usable great for casual and easy to dress up
5,the print and fit of this dress is perfect its very flattering and slimming
5,light and delicious
5,wowcooking lasagne is always a painbut now no problem
5,this recipe is outstanding
5,note the inseam runs a little longer than stated above if you are truly a inseam you may want to get the petite size i purchased the petite small my inseam is and the trousers hit the ground in stocking feet however the length can be changed depending on where you wearplace them on your hip ive worn these trousers at home and around town with ease they are a wonderful cold weather goto wardrobe staple i wear a nylon trouser slip with them to prolong the need for cleaning
5,it is the good value for money and for gaming good graphics like urltra hitman some heavy games can play in high graphics it is one of the beast
5,i am almost convinced that producers get off on starting shows with a great premises griping story lines and then ruining it this show has turned into a bad soap opera and i think the producers get off on it this and thing is fine seemingly on purpose to many others game of thrones as an example characters such as monica that viewers have hated since season one yet they still give her a large role and continue her character as someone the audience cannot stand the episodes are turning into pretty much nonsense gigantic plot holes and for sure they are making sure to put in an the modern day programming white patriarchy and the like
5,i make this recipe often and everyone loves it including the grandkids i even make it for bunco getting raves over it the only addition i make is a very small can of tomato sauce when i add the diced tomatoes its so delicious and comforting love this recipe
5,my family loved this dessert i have now made it several times by special request my only advice to be sure to fold the whipped topping the first time i didnt pay close attention and used a mix master came out runny but still tasted great thanks for sharing this new favorite for our family
5,the processor is really nice and the inbuilt gpu makes it more cool in playing really heavy games wva display does good work in binge watch at this cost comes with a good display and with the speed of ssd making it a x

5,this dress makes me looks curvythin and sexy i tried on almost every dress in the store in every style this one was a winner i bought others but this one was my favorite im dd sz fit perfect the picture online does not do it justice you must give it a chance and try it on for yourself it looks like an average dress on the model if you have curves youll love this dress
5,i bough this to replace an old gb card i had in my phone i am using this in a nokia lumia and it works perfectly
5,if youre a fan of the game this show started off on the right foot towards being another the last of us masterpiece the very first episode is an indication that this is probably going to be one of the greatest tv adaptation of all times they changed a few elements without losing the essence of the original storyline the dialogue in the video game series is so great that they were able to us most of it in the show which you rarely if ever see in tv adaptations if you have never played the game you probably dont feel the same way that thousands of others including myself felt while watching the first episode i urge you to use this next week to buy and play the video game before watching the next episode a real beaut
5,i got this in the brown and absolutely love it this is perfect for cool weather im super particular about fabric quality and this cardigan does not disappoint
5,very good product i like this very good for students and office work
5,had family in town and made this the only thing i did diffident was i put the cream cheese in the food prosseser because we dont like it chunky in the recipe every one loved it
5,this was my favourite show ever since the very first episode some seasons were a bit weaker s for example but up to the end of season they managed to really keep the spirit of the show the spirit of the books and beautiful storylines and character developments the x finale was absolutely incredible and would have been the perfect transition to the spinoff probably the best episode ever in a tv show for me sadly they decided to carry on in s and s with new writters and new showrunners who ended up sinking the ship quicker than the titanic s was boring and pointless lets be honest but at least bruce miller was still in charge so it still made sense overall but s was a total disgrace characters arcs made no sense total for shock value gilead is just like schengen now and the protagonist is totally unbereable they turned the feminist message of the book into a war or menwomen and if youre a woman with child its even better even if youre responsible of the most atrocities and dont even get me started on the gaslighting of these writers and all the interviews they have to release to calm down fans who feel betrayed its pathetic
5,bought this for a vacation to mexico with my boyfriend super flattering and soft big thumbs up
5,its great and amazing
5,im pregnant nd trimester and really wanted a beautiful nonmaternity dress i got this in ivory and its just perfect the lace on the sleeves is really comfortable i love the fit and i love the length i got tons of compliments on it my only regret is that i didnt also get it in slate and i really wishing it would get restocked

5,i love this dress it is very cute and comfortable and great for football games everyday wear it is a little long which is great for me since im taller
5,awesome worked well with the surface tableti later return the surface tablet since it didnt seem like that i needed it but i made sure to take out the memory card never had any issues with it though when i had it
5,those whove given this bad reviews are constantly claiming its trying to be game of thrones its not it is a dark fantasy but the magic is consistent as is for the first season the storytelling its its own world and its a good one i never knew about the witcher until i saw the trailers and then buzzed through the season not a bad performance and yennefer and geralt are the primary characters henry cavil shows his acting chops and the rest of the cast is really well done there is one dragon and its nothing like the beasts from got this dragon is more like a cousin of smaug and the more classical dragons well worth watching
5,this is indeed a wonderful banana bread recipe my sister who hates bananas even had to admit that it was good i did however read lots of reviews before making and i used only cup of sugar brown amp gran sugar and because i did not have buttermilk i substituted with sour cream as suggested and likewise with the walnuts i only had pecans the st time i tried the recipe i used an cup pyrex dish as i saw that it made a really big loaf i started to moniter the baking process at approx hr and tested center with a toothpick this time i doubled the recipe making the same adjustments as before except i used only bananas only had that many and baked in a x i also put a thin coat of cream cheese frosting it was crispy around the edges which made it taste even better moist cake textured bread definitely a keeper
5,so much prettier in person beautiful colors matched together so light and relaxing love at first sight
5,the acting the accents the story line useless if youre going to watch anything at all watch the knick or boardwalk empire something that wont make you feel like youve wasted your precious time
5,this is really good i usually make a potato soup similar but my husband has type diabetes this is a great alternative actually i think we like it better i wouldnt change a thing i serve it with crispy bacon and cheese on top
5,im so glad i tried this dress on to see how lovely it is definitely a keeper
5,i just tried these on today in the store im and found that they were definitely the right length for heels the inseam is correct however i had them ordered in a petite so i could wear them with flats these are super cute jeans
5,it took more cooking time then the recipe stated at least to minutes and i used seasoned breadcrumbs instead of oats and the recipe was amazing i will definitely be making this again
5,this pie was so yummy and amazingly easy to make we harvested our apple tree and wanted to try something new but were a bit intimidated by standard pie crust this came together easily pressed into the pie plate in no time at all and was so delish we added a little cinnamon to both the crust and the apple mixture yum
5,the product is awesome only battery is the main problem which will be removed in rog ally x i hope and thanks flipkart fully new sealed product i got within time
5,i just bought this dress today and it is absolutely stunning it looks so much better in person than on the model i think it runs true to size however it does have relaxed fit overall the dress has nice quality fabric and nice flow without adding bulk great buy
5,i boil the chicken with carrots onions astalk of celery and garlicthen shred it the chicken can be kept in the freezer until you need it for something like this dish if youre using the chicken right away use the broth instead of the canned stuff
5,added lots of storage space to my new nokia lumia very nice the package got here very quickly and i was able to install it easily the phone recognized it immediately i did turn off the phone before inserting the sd it came with an adapter that i didnt need to convert it from micro sd
5,huge success in my house of kids and a husband
5,i have to admit i tried this recipe because i thought the name was so cute i was going to a football party so i used wings instead of thighs it was a big hit they licked the platter clean
5,great first season second season seemed slow to me im loosing interest even did a fast forward to the end the last three episodes just me
5,i loved this jacket when i tried it on in the store and brought home a size med its a nice weight of material lined and very classy i liked the idea of adding it to my collection of suitjackets for business meetings but when i tried it on again using actual outfits from my closet i realized how much it looked like a labcoat i am not giving up if it goes on sale ill order a small to see if it is more flattering but at this point its a nogo
5,lovely shampoo
5,this sweater is super cozy and comfy and my new favorite sweater the green is a dark khaki and really pretty its long enough to wear with leggings but not boxy or frumpy
5,most powerful laptop out there
5,i have been having a few problems with other makeup wipes recently as i am pregnant and my skin has become more sensitive leaving me with a bright red rash after removing makeup i have tried a number of different wipes and these are the first i have used that have not left my skin stinging or red they removed all of my makeup and left my skin feeling great this review was collected as part of a promotion
5,i tried this on instore it is super cute i am waiting for it to go on sale because i wasnt sure it was completely worth the price if you are inbetween sizes take the larger size
5,as a dancer and yoga enthusiast i have tried my fair share of leggings these are probably the best ive ever found pure good makes top quality well fitting leggings that do not slide down shift around or become seethrough regardless of the physicality of your movement they breathe wonderfully and have survived one washing with no illeffects they are high enough in the rise that i never have to worry about revealing anything i dont want nor do i constantly have to adjust them to keep
5,such a lovely well constructed top looks great on petite frames free flowing but not too peasantlike the embroidery is gorgeous while it is pricey it is something you will wear for years as it is a timeless piece
5,this is so delicious and is now a family favoritei did cust the recipe in half as servings is a lot
5,i absolutely love this show and have been looking forward to this season watching the first episode so far i wasnt disappointed actually looking forward to getting more insight into the characters i heard there was an up and coming actress that joined the cast too and i am impressed by her too she is a natural and the dialogues didnt feel forced from her i liked that we got a glimpse of every characters personality and it gives us a glimpse into what could happen to them if they are not careful i am interested to see the development of all the characters looking forward to the next episodes
5,this is the softest cardigan i own perfect for lounging going to from yoga or dressing it up with a statement piece or a scarf ive worn it buttoned or open and receive many compliments i have it hanging on the inside of my closet door because i wear it more than anything else at the moment
5,loved this recipe i added a small chopped red onion and celery seed as i didnt have celery salt i will reduce the sugar next time as i personally found it too sweet but the rest of my family loved it
5,love this recipe not a fan of pinto beans so i leave those out and i use the petite diced tomatoes the kicker when we eat it add corn chips shredded cheese and sour cream omg making this right now it is nationaltacoday
5,i never noticed this sweater online but when i saw it in the store it was love at first sight i agree with other reviewers that the color description is odd the brown is a very pale gray and the blue is a light mint green the sweater is very delicate looking and fits true to size the sleeves are very long covering my hands and i have long arms it does have enough body to make a large roll at the cuff i do have a couple of issues that arent related specifically to this sweater even tho
5,all good
5,best value for
5,is what it says it is great chip fast reliable months so far not a single problem and lots of handling too
5,i bought pair of these in the store and ordered another color at the same time these chinos are great for my figure i like to think of myself as a diamond shape large chest moderate waist large hips and small legs these pants fit so great i bought my regular size and dont have to take in the legs the fabric is nice with the additional stretch so we women who arent or something any longer can still feel great and look good without being dumpy im not a teeny woman either
5,exactly as described and fast delivery very happy
5,this soup is wonderful i made it for several parties and everyone wanted the recipe it makes quite a bit
5,made this for th of july bbq after cooking the macaroni i realized it didnt make very much so had to cook up more cups so if youre bringing this to a party make sure you double the recipei added cubed cheddar cheese and a few t spoons of ranch dressing powder we thought it was very good
5,works great im not a techie kind of person hence dont know if the speed and ratings are for real but it works for me
5,i made this for mothers day desert fabulous everyone loved it moist and really quick to put together the icing is excellent as well not to sweet i put almost a cup of good raspberry jam on the bottom layer and put the icing on the bottom of the top layer shaped them together and it was perfect i decorated the cake with fresh raspberries the leftover cake is now days old and just as delicious as the first day i bake the cake a day ahead and iced in the morning this will be my go to chocolate layer cake
5,good quality easy to use does the job bobs your uncle
5,just made this recipe this morning exactly as written i cut the recipe in half and made large muffins as someone else had done as its just of us baked for minutes and they came out great yummy
5,delicious i put chopped walnuts on top of the frosting
5,i made this without the meat i didnt have any used vegetable broth not because im vegetarian but because its what i had on hand and i oven roasted about a pound of pumpkin chunks from a small pumpkin and pureed it i also used a can of rotel instead of diced tomatoes roasting the pumpkin made it really yummy
5,card is perfect for use in gopro writes fast and provides for super fast transfers to the computer price for two of these was the same as one gb card so the decision was easy id rather have two cards so that i can swap them out continue to record and have someone else transfer from the other one
5,i love this recipe i made as written many times but the last time i added the entire can of pumpkin tsp cinnamon and tsp pumpkin pie spice i added chopped walnuts and put the mix into smaller disposable loaf pans for sharing it was fantastic great either way but if youre looking to use up your pumpkin without doubling the recipe it will work i think its more moist and has more pumpkin flavor great recipe i tell everyone to use it thanks
5,this card has worked flawlessly so far i use it in my garmin montana and it allows me to load all my usgs quads us sw w s central n central and inland lakes i was at first concerned that the would not take gb micro sd but no problem
5,working well
5,the best laptop
5,this top is very pretty i ordered both xs p and xxs p not knowing someone wrote the word boxy in the review i tried on the xxs p first and that was fine did the trick to not look too boxy teh fabric is stretchy and softcomfortable not scratchy lace the lining is soft as well color is ivory and the embroidery is nice and fiery colors the sleeves are fairly flattering even on bigger arms arm hole was just right too never know with fluttery sleeves for reference i am lbs
5,like laura i used a variety of mushrooms lb a whole finely chopped sweet onion and then tsp thyme in addition to the basic recipe it has excellent flavor and texture and is so easy to make too
5,delicious made just like recipe except for the chinese spice since i do not have this will definitely make it again
5,as other reviewers mentioned this sweater is truly nice in person i love the different patterns from the fabric the cut is also flattering not boxy the collar on me turend the other way around dark showing and it also looked nice i wasnt planning on buying anything but it was thanskgiving weekend with you know discount not regretting it i will wear it many ways jeans and tshirt for weekends if i get out of my workout clothes but also could be worn over a nice black blou
5,super excellent
5,im not normally into fantasy films and shows but i cant get enough of this the characters are seen to be more than just characters you want them to succeed and are shocked at some of the actions made because of a connection thats excellently executed by the people who fill the roles and the team that so thoroughly put this series together its a must watch
5,how does a cake with trans fats in both the cake and the frosting get a heart healthy rating

5,lenevo laptop is good so far but battery backup is very poor it drains within max of hours display is good but sound is ok overall this laptop is good for normal use
5,just made this again amp wow it is fantastic i did some modifications this time to try some new things out this recipe is great as is but the additions were nice amp changed it up a little i added c frozen corn to the meatonions in the pan i added cloves garlic chopped to the pan towards the end of cooking i used c tostitos mild chunky salsa used a small amount to coat bottom of baking dish to prevent sticking which worked great i used cans black beans used c lite sour cream which i added to the meat mixture once it was done instead of using it as a layer i used c zesty italian dressing kraft used flour tortillas instead of amp put it all in a x baking pan i used oz authenic mexican cheese blend already preshredded amp more cilantro because we love it this is again amazing amp would be great for any family meal or potluck i would precut it for a potluck though cut with sharp knife first otherwise it will fall apart fantastic
5,very nice part recommended
5,i just love all pilcro pants they are great for any occasion any type of weather i am lb and i wear a in all pilcro pants and they fit perfectly only bummer is that i have to iron them but they iron easily length of these pants is just a tad long but i can wear wedges with them and that solves the problem
5,i made this over years ago for my kids i would put the ravioli in individual ramekins and freeze when they got home from school just take a ramekin from the freezer and bake great little pickpickmeup before after school activities began this is also good with cheese ravioli leftover chicken and alfredo sauce
5,i bought these pants to wear while riding on the back of my husbands motorcycle i wanted something that was more chic than typical motorcycle womens clothing and these were perfect they block the wind but are stretchy on the back side so they are super comfortable to wear all day i also wear these to work on fridays i bought a size and they fit great i usually wear a in us sizing

5,my husband saw this in the store while shopping with me and asked me to try it on i dont normally go for patterns like this but i thought it was cute and springy i tried on a large first since i prefer to cover my belly and allow for my broad shoulders im tall big boned and pounds the large actually stuck out funny at the bottom and didnt do much for my shape the medium however was great it was long enough to hide my belly and cover enough of my waistband that i wouldnt

5,thanks flipkart for support and replacing faulty one purchased for my daughter class eight she is happy its sleek light weight portable and touch screen only issue is that my daughter got addicted to it so need to monitor her hours on it
5,since i didnt check my pantry before starting the recipe i used both crisco and butter in place of the latter one packet of dream whip in place of the instant vanilla pudding only one cup of chocolate chips since thats all i had and one cup of toffee bits to make up for the missing mixins despite all of these changes the cookies were chewy moist and very tasty ive added it to my recipe box
5,this is the best lasagna recipe i have ever had i will not make anything else make sure you put a piece of foil or a cookie sheet under the baking dish because this is filled to the brim and tends to overflow
5,i blended the cottage cheese and eggs eggs in a blender and added th cup of milk i also substituted cubed ham for the bacon i sauteed up a yellow onion and mushrooms to add i omitted the swiss cheese i also added salt pepper ground mustard and garlic powder this was supper yummy my husband likes to eat this with salsa would be okay with ketchup for kids
5,i found this cardigansweater in the sale room at retailer in navy thought i would just try it on the picture does not do this justice it is a basic piece but it is so soft and comfortable and when on it has a little bit of a whimsical swing to it i loved the way it kind of came to life i wear a ml and bought the m i have a d bust and it looked great it is a nice weight for springfall it is not a heavy sweater

5,this is home idea flavor not restaurant but very tasty anyway
5,i have made these several times and they are a hit every time they are so easy to make and only once did i have to add an extra egg white and that could have been due to small eggs
5,ive had nothing but success with sandisk microsd cards although you may pay a few bucks more than the generic brand you dont want to trust your pictures or video recording to anything elseas such i only buy sandisk microsd cards keep up the good quality
5,so far so good i use this with my mobil phone and the product run smoothly no issue as of yet overall im happy with this product
5,i have never read the books and only saw the first jack reacher film starring tom cruise a good movie and i look forward to seeing the sequel but this is the adaptation truer to lee childs vision for one its easier to adapt a book into a series with multiple episodes than a film of rarely more than two hour length so there is plenty of room for each episode to build on the details of the world for another and more importantly this version of jack reacher looks the part tom cruise is a man of athletic but still average physique and famously short alan ritchson really looks the part he is muscular and tall he also brings that likeable energy that tom cruise sometimes doesnt have i look forward to the following seasons i hope that they will produce
5,so easy and delicious my kids adored this meal
5,this mac and cheese tastes as good as it looks in the picture its definitely a keeper i followed the recipe as written but did omit the cheddar cheese it was plenty cheesy without it i also added panko bread crumbs to the top of the casserole when it came out the oven yum this recipe was easy to split in half i used a quart baking dish and baked it for minutes at degrees for half the recipe excellent

5,great sweet corn bread recipe ive made it twice sticking to original recipe it does make a large amount so i froze a few pieces in freezer bags and used them during the rest of the week you can defrost them or they reheat well in the microwave just a minute or less for a couple of pieces this recipe is very much like the krusteaz honey cornbread mix i usually buy if you like sweet cornbread youll definitely want to try this
5,this cardigan is very similar to the c keer wrapped asters cardigan from a few years agoi have this cardigan and have loved wearing it i think it only came in cream color unfortunately i caught the cutouts a few times and the cutouts are slightly ripped in spotsnot very noticeable but i know theyre there so i was delighted to see that retailer brought back this cardigan this time from meadow rue i purchased both the cream and gray colors in a size smalli am usually a s

5,i bought this dress for an all white event i had many compliments but it was the most fun dancing dress because the top layer spins out it is loose and flowy but the arm holes are rather large and sizing down might have been better i am and athletic and ordered a m and if i had time might have exchanged for a s you must steam out creases before wearing

5,love this soup such a easy one to make when its a fallwinter day
5,i always end up walking out of an retailer store with something very different than what i thought and this was one it drapes beautifully and the red color is rich and vibrant cool tone not orangey i fell in love with this one in person it jumped at me in the store but online i think the outfit that the model is wearing is not my style at all and does not do the item justice if you like to cover your assets you will love it
5,this is a crowd winner every time
5,at years old i still like fun hip fashionable items but i dont want to look like i raided my year old daughters closet this jacket hits the mark perfectly it looks great layered over a casual dress or with skinny jeans and a wedge the embroidery and the back tie soften the masculine color and shape ill be wearing this often

5,i have been looking for a pancake recipe that my children could not get enough of this is it they are perfect
5,love this cornbread followed recipe added just a little more milk because i thought the batter was a bit thick
5,purchased this top at my local store usually dont pay full price for clothing but had to have this top so cute and lightweight love that you do not need to wear a cami underneath and has material that covers your bra usually wear a petite size due to tops being cut so low but a regular medium was perfect suggest purchasing this top full price or if still around when it goes on sale definitely purchase i bought the floral design
5,best product best use experience best price range value for money go for it
5,this is the best item i have gotten form retailer the quality is amazing soft covers my butt classic piece
5,i saw this blouse and had to have it i ordered my usual size large and was shocked at how big it was it looked like a maternity top on me so i sized down to medium it fit much better and i was able to fully appreciate how gorgeous the colors were and how feminine and pretty the mock neck was i definitely recommend it but suggest to size down for a better fit
5,my husband has been begging me to make banana bread i found this one and im glad i did i used mini loaf pans and baked them for minutes at i made two without nuts for my year old two topped with pecans for my husband and two topped with walnuts for myself i didnt make the glaze because i didnt have any oranges thanks for the great recipe

5,these are my favorite tights i love how they are opaque i love that they are thick but not so thick as to be only appropriate for winter they are slimming without feeling too tight why dont you sell these any more please bring them back
5,i made these yesterday i cook for one me absolutely delicious you can trust the five stars on this one i only marinated the chicken for less than an hour and these were still delicious i would love to make again and marinate for the full hours i ate some with corn tortillas but ive decided im going to put this over rice tomorrow for a change yum
5,im not a fan of tv series as i hate having to wait until the following week for a continuation as i usually forget details of the previous episode but this show is very easy to follow and keeps you wanting more this is a great genre and done very well with great casting directing and amazing cinematography if you have been considering watching this dont wait any longer i would have given it if the pace was a little faster but still a well deserved from me
5,i can only assume that reacher was originally written as an imposing giant and physical specimen the former being the most noticeably absent with mcquarries tom cruise entry so ritchson definitely looks the part and were reminded of it by a slew of height jokes some welcome levity with a slightly wooden lead actor and a standard story reacher an exmilitary drifter strolls into a small town and immediately arouses the suspicion of the locals and the fuzz if it sounds like rambo yeah but imagine rambo as a quiet observer astute keenly aware and intelligentlike sherlock holmes but perhaps hes too smart for his own good as trouble seems to seek him out despite his logical prowess i was torn whether or not to root for reacher because one could argue hes an antagonist a ruthless killer who fights dirtier than any of his foes his mastery of psychological guerrilla warfare turns the tides in his favor when hes outnumbered or outgunned while he usually has reasons to regulate the bad guys sometimes he does so impulsively moral ambiguity aside reacher has some remarkable action sequences and ties in mystery with some romance and drama the characters are well written and the story doesnt meander too much to pad the length it feels satisfying to watch a tactless reacher march into injustice and correct it with his fists but maybe that says more about me
5,just got the silver ones in the mail yesterday really great fall pants they are quite a bit more grey than how they look on my computer so i was a bit surprised but not unpleasantly im one of those people who always has trouble with pants because my thighs are bigger and my waist smaller than usual im with a inch waist and inch hips i ordered the so my legs could fit inside the pants but there is quite a bit of gaping at the waist meaning that i cannot go without
5,me waist hips tried the size the usual for me in pilcro they fit like a glove and i loved them i clearly needed a heel to do them justice and now i see the photos of my rear im a bit doubtful but pilcros always stretch a little and these are super soft and funky a win
5,i had to return my original order to size down the bottom half was fine with either size but the medium was baggy in the back torso area im i bought the tangerine version which really is more red than orange its versatile and can be paired with various third pieces and shoes i do have a long torso and this waist is a bit short on me however
5,quick shipment product as described comes with adapter which will come in handy sandisk is a great product it usually delivers quality item
5,only thing i added was cup worcestershire sauce and some crispy fried french fries
5,i much better
5,i purchased this in london early april and i wore it to a summer wedding it was perfect and hangs very nicely the colors are rich and the deep blue flowers have texture the front slit goes up to about the knee but doesnt split apart when walking which i appreciated the only thing that i felt was a little off was the circumference of the sleeves i have to keep them unbuttoned but thankfully it looks like just an interesting detail and not so much like an unbuttoned sleeve a definite keep
5,first i must agree with the other reviewers who said that this jacket is short because well it is that being said it is a perfect length for someone who is petite like me i am not a fan of lengthy tops or jackets which tend to make my short body look like a blob i love the length or shortness of this jacket aside from that it fits true to size is wonderfully warm and cozy and makes me feel fabulous when im wearing it it is my new favorite jacket
5,awesome recipe simple and delicious
5,delicious i have made it for church potlucks as well as picnics at our cabin everyone wants the recipe
5,this recipe was easy and delicious we made it last night for dinner definite keeper to make again on a chilly winter night i was slightly confused on the cheese because cups would be ounces but the recipe says ouncesi used oz bags and it was fine im not sure in our house there is such a thing as too much cheese
5,i want to hate these jeans because they are so expensive but every time i try these on they just look so cool they seem to be handmade so the flowers are not in the same spot on each pair
5,havent made this yet but i know it will be something ill make again and again
5,i love the look and feel of this tulle dress i was looking for something different but not over the top for new years eve im small chested and the top of this dress is form fitting for a flattering look once i steamed the tulle it was perfect i ordered an xsp length was perfect too
5,super nice
5,i took this to our churchs annual chili cookoff as an alternative for those who didnt want chili what a surprise when i won nd place people raved and were disappointed when the crockpot was empty i had not made it before but my family says that this needs to be a staple in our meal rotations i track points with weight watchers and even with the velveeta it only comes out to ppv not bad for a hearty and satisfying soup
5,i installed this in my phone to take advantage of extra space for downloaded movies and games seems fast cool
5,its got a luvly smell and it saves my carrying home from the shops much easy to have it delivered the only mistake was i ordered the wrong size i need the wash but not to worry il double check next x
5,this is a great coat very lightweight but warm the color is gorgeous it is fitted at the waist with fullness below and a great length i am writing this review to give a heads up about the sizing by usual retailer sizing this runs small and short waisted i am generally an retailer x small and i need to exchange this one for a small or maybe even a medium if i want to wear much underneath it as it is it fits too well like a dress not a coat and looks short waisted in fact when i tr
5,the price is amazing for this easy and flattering dress looks great as is or with a scarf sweater jacket you name it i just couldnt resist getting carried away with this one
5,ive never made mushroom soup before and im glad i made this recipe i absolutly loved it the only thing i did different is add garlic powder and thyme
5,the first half of the season captures the addams family vibe very well dark humorous and a little offbeat the end is transformed into a stereotypical fantasy teen drama mixed with mysteryrevelationbigger mystery dance that progressively becomes so fastpaced and over the top that i stop caring who is involved in what and why excellent play in the character of wednesday though her parents fall a little flat and without much of the soneeded chemistry the series has outstanding cinematography nice special effects soundtrack definitely onpoint a huge disappointment feels like a plothole is how a certain illintentioned individual is so determined to fight a special group of people without realising he is just as special himself as his enemies these series definitely feel targeted to younger audiences
5,great transitional top comfy and great fit i like my tops to be somewhat roomy and this was great in a small i usually buy medium
5,i really changed some things in this recipe but plan on trying the original when i have all the ingredients i used extra beans and cubed chicken did not have turkey didnt have yellow pepper so used frozen summer squash diced also out of tomatos so used salsa which made it so thick so used extra broth not done yet buy did taste test and its wonderful and soooo full of flavor the five stars if because i already know the original recipe is great without trying it yet i also sauted the chicken pieces in the olive oil then the onionsand garlic along with the bits of goodies left in the pan wonderfulthank you for the great recipe
5,when i mix up a batch of these i bake them using my muffintop pans then sandwich the tops together with the frosting these freeze well
5,excellent i always cut the sugar in half and add a smidgen of stevia leaf powder in order to trim calories and fat from recipes especially from sugar filled desserts my bananas were small so i used and mashing them gave me a bit more than a cup i also use a nonegg egg replacer because of allergies to eggs some recipes dont turn out as well using egg replacer but this one turned out beautifully i also use an icing sugar made with tapioca flour due to allergies i used half the icing sugar and added about cup tapioca flour to help with the volume and did not add in any stevia there was still enough frosting to cover the bars and it was still plenty sweet some reviews mentioned that the recipe didnt make dozen but it does i cut into rows inch side by rows inch side they were the perfect size i took them to a large gathering and received many compliments on them definitely a keeper
5,i love this recipe i have tweaked the recipe a little i dont add the ranch dressing mix and i do it without beans taste good on corn chips or tortilla chips i had some on elbow macaroni and it was good my husband loves it too
5,i tried this on in the burgundy color in the store and hoping it goes on sale soon the fabric is not too thin like some of their tops i run the gamut in retailer sizes but lean towards mediums this top fit beautifully in a small it drapes nicely and doesnt hug the body nor is it too flowy looking maternityish i am and dd for reference it looks like it will hold up well and the bit of lace makes it dressy casual if it doesnt go on sale soon i might have to get it anyway b
5,very sleek and good performance got this for k value buy
5,i love this little number the quality is terrific the weight is perfect and the cut is superb i love the way it fits and looks in the arms i ordered my usual xxsp and it is perfect i like that it is cool and flowy without looking like maternity attire i have the bright turquoise and i am going to order another i was about to order what looks like a yellow one but i noticed the color is labeled chartreuse can anyone tell me if this is more yellow or green in real life
5,this is hands down the best banana bread i have ever eaten or made it is my new goto recipe since last year i get many and often requests at church to bring it to any gettogether and to make it for bakesales amazing
5,omg i made this i did add mushrooms instead of carrots and i did add smoked paprika but amazing im a vegetarian so this was perfect i used vegetable broth not water also i am in love with this and will pass it along yummy

5,this is a delicious recipe i will definitely be making this again the only substitute i made was replacing the walnuts for pecans the result was successful and delicious thank you for sharing
5,the best product in this price range
5,this was delicious i did make a few changes i used lb ground beef pound ground italian sausage and i also threw in jar of real bacon bits and added liquid smoke for even more flavor i used cups of ny sharp cheddar instead of velveeta i also used garden vegetable broth instead of chicken broth since someone i was cooking for is allergic to chicken very flavorful will definitely make again

5,when i say its slow i mean it it is incredibly slow if listening to long drawn out scenes of dialogue or watching buildup scenes that drag on for far too long is your thing youll probably enjoy this show more than i did anyway this is the first star wars content since rogue one that has actually been worth paying attention to story elements throughout the season actually matter its not a never ending barrage of video game side quest resolved episode by episode like the mandalorean and it doesnt have looney tunes scenes such as the one where a child is being snuck out of an imperial base under a trench coat in the obi wan show this one is far more grounded and helps fill in some of the blanks between the original trilogy and prequels without being disrespectful to what came before unlike majority of disney star wars if you want a disney star wars show that isnt insufferable or pointless this is your best bet forget the rest they are absolute rubbish in comparison
5,these jeans are really soft comfortable and flattering but only after you go a size down all the other pilcro jeans ive bought have been a consistent but when i got these they were baggy i exchanged them for a and they were just the ticket
5,this is very very good but as all entertainment there are problems with it first of all the acting is the best ive seen in any television show and it remains consistent for every season being a fellow brit i thought the accents where quite good a little hard to understand sometimes which it would have been at the time period the only persons accent i have a problem with is the leader of the billy boys i cant remember his name his accent was dreadful now season one and two where my personal favourites the pacing was excellent and knew when it had to speed up and take a break from the action which was so brutal and compliments the show so very well the characters are were the show shines the interactions they have between each other are son interesting and entertaining the dialogue for every season besides season three which i will get to is extremely satisfying the camera work is nothing too exciting but is grounded and works well for the nineteen hundreds were the show takes place also my oh my was the villain great every single action he did was so horrid and made me hate the character with all my heart which is what you want for a show like this its all due to the incredible performance by sam neill somehow the show makes you root for the alcoholic gangster murderers instead of an irish police officer it really takes a different perspective from any other television creation season three on the other hand was a bit lacklustre the show tried to grow too fast the peaky blinders all of a sudden had ten enemies and a hundred different problems to face and it all became a huge mess sometimes becoming difficult to follow the show also took a turn towards more buisnessy affairs which i didnt enjoy as much besides all this it was still great oh yeah tom hardy randomly showing up for a small part was amazing hes amazing in this show i just wish there was more of him season four picks it back up with a simple revenge story and it works excellently the villain is pretty simple nothing too special with an overall bland and cliché performance from alist actor adrien brody season five is pretty good as well the start of the season is really strong and has the shelby family in a feud but the show very quickly forgets about this and moves on to other more boring things the very ending is alright it still makes me want to watch the next season or film whenever it comes out i realise that i have been quite harsh in this review but the show is really good and has and will inspire plenty of other shows in the future i forgot to mention the absolutely incredible soundtrack that features my favourite artists radiohead which instantly makes it better
5,wonderful chowder although dont use packaged shredded cheese it curdles still tastes fab but doesnt present as well a definite keeper
5,excellent product having been using it for awhile now suitable for the whole family which makes it an obvious choice
5,for student learning its good
5,this cardigan can be dressed up with leggings and booties or dressed down with jeans and chucks i love the fit of the small and smallmedium build would highly recommend for a dinner out or lounging around at home
5,im rewatching the entire series which i dont often do with shows with such consistently dark storylines the stories of the characters are gripping chilling and in some cases horrifying this shows cast is the true epitome of an ensemble drama i cant wait for june for the return of tht
5,easy and goodwill make again
5,noticed this sweater as soon as i walked in the store i am lbs with an athletic build so teeter between a small and medium in tops i spent a long time trying to decide if i preferred the small or medium fit the sweater is a bit boxy so ended up sizing up as the longer length seems to off set some of the boxiness i am looking forward to wearing this with skinny jeans and boots as another reviewer suggested i think a denim shirt will look great underneath rated a good in quality b
5,wowtakes me back to mom made this a bunch make that grub go as far as you could
5,i love this recipe also my family and friends
5,this worked for me very elegant cozy and comfortable
5,i use this card in a galaxy note and i have been very pleased with its performance it is noticeably faster than the class card i replaced i use it for storing and then watching movies and it plays them back with no observable buffering time it is also fast for writing photos or videos that i shoot using the camera on the tablet and the cost was among the lowest for cards of this storage size and speed class
5,i have never made this recipe exactly how it says but i use it as a guide i dont add carrots i use celery and onions the biggest change i make is using homestyle canned biscuits i cut each biscuit into thirds and toss in flour which helps to thicken the soup my husbands favorite
5,great product under k super performance value for money battery capability it just hours but this is superbmore review may i update next coming days
5,this was very good i omit the nuts but it really had nice flavor i reduced the cook time by about minutes i did the toothpick test on my smaller loaf pan just in case then decided to check the larger as well they were both done
5,this is the perfect pencil skirt the pattern is flawless the top shown with it here online is outrageously expensive i paired it with a lace turquoise top that retailer has in stores and you can also wear it with a wine colored top i would not wear it with black because you just lose the stunning colors if you love fall colors this skirt is perfect

5,i bought this to increase the music capacity of my mp player as a bonus i can use the adapter with my old gb micro in my digital camera

5,this is a super good cake i use it for strawberry shortcake and it has always been a big hit at my home it is great plain too try it youll love it
5,keep hangs after to minutes of use and restart is the solution and ctrlshiftr not solving always any one has similar issues
5,write after month of laptop purchaselaptop is very goodpurchase it value for money
5,pi like other people prefer not to use sugarfree ingredients so i use regular pudding mix and regular cool whip tastes great ppalso wrong cklee im not sure why you felt the need to correct people a simple google search would have told you it is pig pickin not pig lickin i have no idea why youd try to correct people without first making sure you were correct youre notp
5,i love this jumpsuit its fun flirty and seems to put a smile on the faces of passersby it works for multiple occasionsevents and is so comfortable if daytime pajamas sounds good to you this is your jumpsuit dress it up with an updo and dangly earrings or down with slipons and a cardigan i have found that i cant go wrong with it fits me just perfectly doesnt wrinkle too much during wear and the adjustable shoulder ties are convenient
5,good for study and coding nice laptop using years
5,started out really good but as the seasons moved on the slow motion scenes and loud music between dialog ramped up the audio by season is overwhelming the music overpower the dialog youll find yourself tuning volume up and down during this season the story also went downhill and became farfetched by the end downgraded
5,we love this soup it is so fast and economical we make it many times during the winter months
5,good value
5,this cake is delicious as a snack cake without frosting or topping because it is more dense than regular cake we like to use this recipe for strawberry shortcake it is sooo good
5,got this on offer for clothes come out very soft and smelling great and it should last a long time too its genuine as well
5,loved this top when i first saw it online and when it arrived it didnt disappoint at all dress it up or down

5,after the show you cannot stop thinking about thomas shelby ive never seen any movie characters that stay in your head like that
5,i use this recipe all the time so easy to prepare i also use scallops in place of the shrimp
5,the fit is incredible the print is very subtle but makes them a little bit edgy and easy to pair with many things i already have in my closet
5,i have other brands but prefer sandisk i have several and have never had an error or failure i often shoot video in k at a high bitrate and this memory card can keep up thats important to mei would highly recommend this card
5,niceee product
5,bought this shirt in the black runs tts very comfortable and flattering past left of center shirts in this stylefabric seem to run a little large but i bought this in my usual retailer m and its great very similar to last years style but perhaps a tad more fitted i gave it a for quality bc i have noticed a little bit of pilling under the arm area but overall it holds up pretty well
5,make sure to format to fat to be compatible with both aosp and touchwiz roms if youre not running any aosp roms just pop the card in it will be formatted to exfat automatically i formatted to fat with guiformat in pc and havent had any issues optional search the xdadeveloper forum for instructions on swapping internal sd card with external sd card and give your phone gb of internal space for those apps that wont move to sd
5,i have admittedly not read any of the lee child books or have a huge affinity for reacher i just want a great story with some action season delivered with interesting side characters and small town justice the battle at the end was fairly epic and reacher was just a terminator and great to watch i have no idea if the show runners changed or scriptwriters went on vacation but season has a totally different vibe reacher operates in a band of exmilitary operatives trying to untangle a murder mystery my frustration is he isnt front and center and this show works so much better with him as a lone wolf the side characters are unconvincing and unlikeable contrasted with season s cop and lawyer who were great really disappointed and hope this show does better for season if renewed go back to the roots
5,good nice product
5,like most people i always forget to leave positive feedback but always quick to leave negative feedback this time i make a point item as described very happy with the service thank you very much

5,not a fan of horseradish sauce or swiss cheese pepper jack cheese gave it the right kick for us

5,delicious i upped the broth since some thought it was too cheesy
5,i got these in the brown and the red in my usual xspetite and love both the length is perfect for my height and theyre not skin tight but fit like a glove i have a waist and hips the elastic inside the waistband can get flipped fairly easily if im not careful but its easy to flip it back i think thats the only thing that might stop me from attempting to wash them in the machine against the instructions which say to hand wash only i wish they had been made machine washa
5,ive had this for about a week now and so far no problems due to my laziness i didnt do a lot of research beforehand and didnt find out about the problem these cards had with the galaxy s which is the phone i have until after i had bought the card apparently the cards kept unmounting themselves even if you remounted it in the settings fortunately sandisk caught wind of the problem a couple months ago and fixed it so kudos to them
5,forgot to add that i used only cup of butter by accident and it turned out just as good
5,excellent thank you flipcart
5,i loved this top so much i bought both colors soft and warm without being too thick or bulky
5,i have this in the beautiful spring greenpink combo and i this gorgeous bluemaroon tapestry combo which is prefect for fall unfortunately i bought the green in s and its still pretty big in the bust area but they sold out of xs i was able to get the blue in xs and it fits perfectly i usually order m
5,this blouse is so beautiful and feminine it fits loosely and is see thru so you do need to wear a cami underneath it it is very comfortable to wear i got many compliments when i wore this blouse all the delicate lace on it just makes you feel very pretty in it however be extra careful when you do wear it im still not quite sure how it happened but the lace in the front got a small hole right in the front on my first time wearing it its so pretty i just hope i can get it fixed so it w
5,i got this dress in pxxs in the gray color i am lbs petite frame and it fits like a dream true to size the fabric is super soft and thick drapes well not too tight and u can wear a regular bra length is also perfect no shortening required which is rare for me this could be an issue for tall girls but i wouldnt know about that it looks great with dressy flip flops for any summer occasion can be casual or dressy depending on accessories great purchase recommend
5,best laptop for in this range looks are very attractive
5,i have enjoyed the whole series and the final one last night was equally as brilliant as was the first but this whole series has had unusual music where was the opening music that has become synonymous to the whole peaky blinders it was a big miss
5,love everything about this series baby yoda is adorable the locations are amazing and the depth of the universe is fascinating
5,nice laptop under trading
5,not much to say fits tts a beautiful top colors are striking
5,if you have a problem with this tv show you are not a true star wars fan youre probably the same ppl that complain about the flash on tv should be on the movie screen or the fact that michael b jordan was a bad guy on black panther somethings dont fit your narrative but this show involves everything about star wars as a whole the great episode casting from timothy olyphant to rosario dawson its a treat and frustrating to have to wait every week for another new episode awesome show
5,bought this in my usual size small and it fits well i wear it around the house constantly to stay warm this winter it is so very warm and comfortable very easy to wear could be worn out but i prefer it with lounge pants due to the comfort and warmth it provides it is a nice neutral and can be worn with many other retailer casual clothes highly recommend
5,this bread is excellent easy to follow recipe
5,this recipe was awesome my family
5,overall very good my kidd happy
5,not a good typer or speller here is what i didsince i could not format it on my pc running windows pro or any of my cellphones running android versions of from republic wireless on my canon vixia hf m dual card camrcorder i formated the card but the thing is it still read as exfatso i mounted it onto my samsung galaxy anyway and it said something about corrupt files or what ever and it asked if i wanted to format and i press ok and yeap it works now it reads about gigs and some got this gig baby for from amazon warehouse deals i bought two but they cancelled one for no stock but it was still showing stock oh well all i really needed was one i just got greedy
5,bought this for my new galaxy s and it works great class is the way to go especially when slower cards are not much cheaper
5,nice product picture quality is awesome
5,i used this on chicken breasts and my family enjoyed it turned out quite moist
5,the mandalorian season wow it was a total binge of the best kind more aliens than you could possibly want and totally lacking in any plot predictability the acting and script were just incredible it was all totally invisible and totally believable even the side cameos were brilliantly done much of its strengths harked back to the first trilogy of star wars movies and was totally intentional the recipe was strong characterisations throughout both good and evil yes the bad guy was dressed in black and there were dark troupers a moral hero who lived by a code but what that code was remained elusive incomparable bravery irony and sarcasm throughout comic scenarios incredible and imaginative aliens i dont speak frog lol both short and long stories running concurrently and an incredible narrative drive it was all stitched together like a really long movie without doubt this is the best thing i have seen this year by miles and seemingly the star wars dream will be kept alive by disney the mandalorian series there were problems firstly the title says it all the programme skewed towards female empowerment in the form of bokatan kryze unfortunately this was not a very interesting character and the acting from this actress was stiff as a board this was a mistake focus on our hero and grogu and how their story develops and less trendy representational politics two programmes were appalling chapters and the first became absurd with some bizarre sojourn to some weird world for some ridiculous reason as for the story was jumbled there were no survivors on mandalor and why would this world be chosen as a base for the last remnants of the republic the whole thing seems to have become quite infantile when is was adult nuanced and profound the main reason was we had one writer and not a committee watering down the dream of the writer some of the directors chosen on this project need firing overall series was a outta keep to a good strong story with a strong end goal and narrative impetus because someone took their foot of the gas here
5,ive made this recipe several times each time i have omitted the onion and replaced the bacon with sausage its always a hit
5,its hard to go wrong with the charlies especially in this fabric keep them coming i wrote a review on the brush strokes as well they fit pretty true to size id say try both your usual size and one size down as well they stretch out a little so if they feel a little tight keep that in mind because of the texture of these pants you can wear so many more colors than just usual black and white trouser fabric try wearing a burnt orange green or pink the isabella sinclair grid wrap but
5,call my corny but this dress inspires me to run barefoot through the lavender fields in provence the flowy layers and dreamy prints are mesmerizing fit is ideal for my body type as long as you size down i had no weird sagging bagging or poofiness and i love the macrame belt i tied it offset to the side but the dress looks good unbelted too i purchased the small petite my stats for fit reference tall dd waist hips wide rib cage size ml tops size sm
5,delicious soup i made it just as the recipe instructs i had no hot sauce i did have some pepper jack cheese so i added two slices of it i like the fact that this soup is good for me tasty and not high in calories
5,i saw this in my local store last night and was instantly drawn to the color it is more greenish than yellow i say this alot but this was so much prettier in person i would not look twice at it online the picture does it no justice i am not a pancho person but this looks very luxurious and expensive and it feels so soft and warm i tried the xss and it fit perfect i am typically a medium in other brands at antrho it is boxy but that is the point of a sweater of this type it will be p
5,super salad wondered what i was going to do with the case of kraft macaroni and cheese i bought from costco because it had been wonderful when i was seven along with spagetti os i obviously didnt grow up in a household where mom liked to cook anyway the kraft noodles were just the right size i like sweet dressings so bottled poppyseed or the recipe from joans broccoli madness go great the packages of three color coleslaw make this super quick
5,these are very good i was concerned about how long it would take them to get firm in the refrigerator but it was ready by the time i prepared the next layer
5,i made this for my family several months ago delicious i have made it more times since then my husband raves about it and my teenage son eats the zucchini with no complaints stars from us
5,this dress looks and feels classy and expensive every time i wear it out i get compliments on the color and style
5,overall good quality item worked fine from the start with no problems stores photos quick without a lot of hassle
5,love the smell of this my washing smells lush and i can smell it in the room when the clothes are put away usually buy when on offer around
5,superb kit the persil nonbio is great and we use it for all our clothes and other than really stubborn stains its great one word of warning although it does say it handles a c wash i tend to go at least to ensure the gel has been thoroughly rinsed from the machine and clothes a washing machine repair guy once told me was a false economy especially if using gel as it can build up over time and cause issues the comfort is really nice leaves fabric soft and huggable
5,i also made this in reverse cooking the bacon first then the onions and then the chicken i seasoned the chicken with montreal steak seasoning instead of lemon pepper after the chicken was cooked i placed the broken up bacon pieces and onions on top i then added the cheese and placed a lid on the skillet to allow the cheese to melt delicious i have also subbed swiss cheese for the colby monterey jack sometimes i add sautéed mushrooms to the toppings this is a great recipe that can be tweaked to meet the tastes of your family
5,love this blouse and stunning color the ruffles make it special and different
5,while i prefer the pro sandisk for my cameras this has worked well in a smaller pointandshoot camera and now in my galaxy siii plenty of room on it ultra is not as fast as pro but plenty fast enough for my phone including the few photos i take about to seconds to write to it now getting gb units and looking at a gb expensive
5,i am pleasantly surprised by this purchase i went back and forth on buyin this but ended up trying it out so glad i did it is very flattering and a very nice color it fits perfectly and i look forward to wearing it with my distressed denim and boots for fall
5,i would never have bought this top from the online photo but happily came across in in my local store i bought it in the hot pink gingham check and it is so cute and fresh will work well for hot summer days when i may want to wear rolled up sleeves as it is very lightweight and gauzy i bought my usual xs b lbs and whilst it is looser on me than the model i would still say that it is tts maybe a little fuller in the back than i would like but i will wear mine partially tu
5,the best banana nut bread ever the only change that i made was the nuts i put the whole cup in the batter but didnt put any on the top until i glazed the loaves and then i only sprinkled a few utterly delicious
5,this product was early coming in it works great in my samsung galaxy note tablet its easy to upload and export items from multiple devices with the adapter that comes with it
5,i was there at the beginning as an eight year old in dreaming of being luke skywalker rogue one is the best star wars film to come out in the last years and andor is the best tv series dont get me wrong i love love love the mandolorian and the book of boba fett kicks ass but andor is by far my favorite dramatic and heartfelt it feels like a real world not some cartoon cutout like the jar jar prequels or the rushed money grab of episodes to i get that the sw universe was originally meant for the bright eyed child in all of us but its nice to see finally that some people take this world seriously the bad batch is my second favorite after this
5,i purchased this top in a regular small and surprisingly it fits me very well im b waist hips the hem falls about two inches longer than shown on the model i like the vneck the most because the ruffles are not too much and its not too low cut i purchased the white color because i think the pattern is unique and its brighter for springsummer i think skinny jeans and ankle boots or wedges would make the look very stylish by the way the fabric is super soft but not w
5,this dress is beautiful it may run a tad large everything about the dress is very appealing from the nice fabric beautiful design and colors of the print it will go straight into fall so very happy i tried it i have a beautiful elegant dress for the hot weather
5,great on money
5,i bought this coat years ago and every fallwinter i cant wait to wear it again cant even begin to describe how many people comment on how beautiful and unique it is it has worn well over the years considering how much it has been worn but i just might be tempted to buy it again which is something i have never done with a statement piece the only design feature i would change is that it has no closure i actually had a beautiful large antique button that i sewed on with a snap and it
5,i saw this on a model in the house and home catalog it looked very comfy but with an edge of elegance i saw it in store in the navy and loved it the other color is very washed out not good for me being a blonde i didnt try it on and got a small as it looked as it ran a little large im lbs and it fit perfectly it hits above knee a little longer than on model it hangs beautifully and the blue color is stunning looks expensive i received a few complements the first time i w
5,excellent cake i use cake flour and substitute hot black coffee for the hot water i have tried other substitutions but they do not improve the cake this is a very rich cake because of the sour cream so a small piece of cake is very filling to keep the cake tender go easy on the mixing and get the cake in the oven as soon as the mixing is complete
5,season three has continued to deliver the most stunning cinematography and art direction the story continues its horror and unfortunately some aspects are still happening in this century elisabeth olsen carries the whole series with her incredible performance
5,never read the books played the game was excited to see this though and sadly found myself deeply underwhelmed its not even a poor mans got ok i know it isnt meant to be but i found it so corny and badly scripted if this is doing anything for cavills career good luck to him but between this and the superman franchise he might want to think about going in for an acting job some time soon
5,i made this soup tonight and i would defiantly make it again it was super easy i didnt grate my carrots i just sliced them real small and it worked just fine sharing this with all of my friends
5,this is a really good soup before i added the sour cream at the end i tasted it its good to eat with or without the addition of the sour cream homemade cream of chicken soup was used to replace the canned version in my soup
5,i had been looking for a green jacket with a hood just like this one and was thrilled to find it i found the fit to be true to size i am pounds and i bought the xs which is my usual size in retailer jackets i love the material and the way it hangs so casually
5,super flattering and lovely material dressup or down they run true to size
5,i tried this out for a potluck dish everyone enjoyed amp was wanting the recipe will make again
5,my preschool aged children and husband liked this recipe i doubled the sauce ingredients and made thighs i did not need the cornstarch to thicken the sauce
5,original product worth the price for i proce
5,great recipe made almost exactly as written left out the sour cream since it was already so creamy my husband and i both loved it and cant wait to make it again
5,this tank is super soft and very well fitted it fits true to size the lace is so pretty in front but what makes this unique is the lace on the back of the top it is a unique design and good quality
5,recd so many compliments on this absolutely beautiful comfortable and versatile try it with white crops and cute heels
5,wow these cupcakes are great the icing certainly sets these cupcakes apart from the many other recipes available we made some to share with neighbors and they also enjoyed them much
5,this was so delicious the combination of chocolate and strawberry is amazing and i got many compliments on it the only problem i had was with the chocolate garnishes i got them made and on the cake but they got all droopy and wouldnt stay up after only a couple minutes also if you make this in advance i would follow georgeannes advice about dipping the strawberries first because i didnt and they did leak onto the frosting but it was still delicious
5,very good products
5,i really like these sandisk ultra microsdhc class cards i have several and when i see huge price drops i pick them up for phones cameras gps as well as tablets on which i store video files for traveling ive never had a problem with a sandisk
5,very delicious loved it would not change anything
5,good product at this price
5,nice product suitable for any type of working and not too short works fast
5,so easy and delicious the meat was incredibly tender i didnt have brown gravy mix so i just stirred beef bullion and cornstarch into the water
5,great product value for money is great
5,this is my favorite breakfast casserole that i make it is also a favorite of anyone that tries it i have made some minor revisions i use one one ounce block of low fat cream cheese and a whole loaf of white bread minus slices it makes it more substantial i use cups of blueberries in the casserole one is not enough for an x pan i also make a double batch of the syrup but only add total cup of sugar this allows a person to really add a nice scoop of syrup if you add cups of sugar it is much too sweet i have the perfect breakfast treat thanks taste of home for providing this fabulous recipe many years ago
5,i was skeptical at first but the otter is now part of our sleep routinewe exhibited the breathing but the rest is just greatthe somewhat clumsy body doesnt bother us since the otter until now does not serve as a cuddle
5,its good
5,realistically i probably could have gotten away with a gb card but like anything its better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it popped it into my moblie phone an put all my music on it plus enough room for photos or videos etcno hiccups or errors yet and holds a ton of stuff
5,birmingham was the best choice for the pike blinders events crowded polluted and black city throughout class differences the series tells the story of the s when birmingham was in space there are two first and second world wars an atmosphere of poverty economic crisis communism and conflict it shows well between independence groups picky blinders was able to do well even deepen the depth of social relationships and the details of these problems and engage the audience fully
5,ive grown up with the addams family and watched the show before it went into syndication i read some of the bad reviews and almost didnt watch the show but glad i did i binged it in one day because i had to know who the monster was i found it entertaining intriguing and well acted all the nuances of the original addams family such as the you rang the double snapping of fingers and even the night time angles of the school looked exactly like the addams family mansion i gladly look forward to more seasons of this show and hope it continues only those who want it to be a replica of the original series will be disappointed
5,they are not easy to find and they are rare an all around masterpiece
5,fantastic recipe i rate this as a full five star recipe it just was not letting me do the star rating part furthermore i have been making this for years and everyone loves it i actually searched it just to give it a rating i initially got it from the taste of home magazine everyone that tastes it asks for the recipe and i never have left overs my husband actually asks me to make batch for the house and the bbq so he can have some when he wants a snack later because he knows it will be gone before we get home i have even have people complain that i did not make enough because it is gone before they can even dish their plate at the bbqs it is a keeper i did not put celery in it or the pepper i also let the bacon and veggies sit in sauce for five ten minutes before i pour over the noodles and i think it makes for better flavor
5,good looking laptop this display is much better that price of at giving laptop this price not giving other companies that specification so i feel best laptop in that segment
5,peaky blinders is a solid show thats definitely worth checking out the cinematography is straightup stunningit legit feels like youre dropped into the gritty s and s the visuals alone make every scene pop cillian murphy absolutely kills it as thomas shelby turning him into an iconic character you cant forget tom hardy nailed it and deserves an award for his performance the rest of the cast is no slouch eithereveryone brings their agame and makes the world feel real with episodes across six seasons some moments drag a bit and the pacing couldve been tighter a few storylines start feeling repetitive but let me tell you the sixth episode of each season are awesome theyre always a highlight though they dont singlehandedly save the weaker seasons heres my quick take on each season season good start sets the vibe nicely season the best season season kinda meh not bad but not amazing season bounces back strong season another soso one for me season emotional finale that hits hard overall id give it a its a good show with some killer moments but it didnt blow me away every single time still if youre into crime dramas with style youll probably dig it
5,these are my goto muffins when i dont have any crazy ingredients on hand theyre easy and simple and good
5,these are hands down the best meatloafmeatballs recipe i have ever tried its a win every single time
5,this top is so pretty and easy to wear the material is super soft its long enough to tuck in as pictured but looks fine untucked the back is gorgeous and will prompt me to wear my hair up to show it off great purchase on retailer weekend id be surprised if it lasts long enough to make it to sale
5,this recipe was so good im an older senior who needs easier things to make i love stuffed green peppers amp i cook a lot this made it so much easier to get that taste without all the work i put in the brown sugar as i dont care for sweet food
5,wow where to start this is not an easy watch it is brutal from start to finish and it stays with you afterwards but the story is compelling and gripping the acting and casting is just perfect and the twists and turns keep you on the edge of your seat elisabeth moss as june is simply incredible throughout honourable mention for ann dowd who plays aunt lydia too who plays the evil aunt so well not many tv shows leave me thinking about it afterwards one of the best if not the best yes its that good shows of all time watch it
5,i love this top im lb and the small fits well probably could have fit in the xs it is more fitted at the top and flowy at the bottom i ordered it in orange and it is a very pretty peachy coral stripe highly recommend for a comfy top that can be dressed up a bit more than your average tshirt
5,i accidentally found this gem at my store today i adore layering my style and this is a perfect edition its light but has enough weight to it that it has some movement and doesnt stick to other fabric i wouldnt quite call it gauze since its heavier than your typical gauze its super long im and it definitely went to my knees when worn buttoned up its clean and classic when worn open its cool bohemian and edgywhile still looking totally put together i adore this wish
5,amazing product from acer love it
5,not enough to say but very underrated for peaky blinders one of the best tv show mankind ever made outstanding performance by murphy
5,very good pro
5,i love this recipe the flavor is delicious to madelyn below who wondered if anyone has used another cheese other than velveeta i did i cubed up cheddar cheese i did not like it as well i didnt like the texture and the flavor was a little different i am sticking with velveeta
5,its worth to buy if you are getting this near because you cant get a better laptop than this in this price range
5,this is much more a blouse than a tee the detailing is beautiful and the fabric on the back is a more stuff starched cotton not stretchy jersey because of that i felt like this top ran small i had to size up
5,happy to get it on my bucket
5,excellent flavor the gravy would be good on other dishes as well i only used a top crust
5,smells great and good price if you can get for
5,i just bought these jeans and i absolutely love them they are my new favorites i like them so much i am buying another pair i am short but always wear heels and these are perfect in every way slimming as well
5,works as expected based on price and performance this may be a best of breed product i have found the sandisk brand to be dependable
5,after reading all reviews i didnt know what to expect but i really loved the design so i ordered it any way how positively surprised i was this dress has a structure the fit is great just right in all places the length hits right at the knee i was afraid it would be too heavy for a denim dress but it is actually thin and soft not hot at all for better understanding of the fit i am lb and c im between s and m in tops because of my wide shoulders but size in this dre
5,everyone loves it
5,i like this layer for fall for many reasons first of all the color is a beautiful fall color the design of the vest is flattering when wore with skinny jeans or leggings the weight of the vest is perfect for the cooler weather it is not too heavy its fairly lightweight i am a size and the small fit perfectly
5,ashen my dude you just need to take a measuring cuptsp and use it times these cookies were delicious and didnt give me any problems despite my use of gf allpurpose flour
5,i ordered the gold in size xl it fits true to size matching the online photos the color details are prettier in person such a comfortable tee its washeddried well too i hope they make more colors for this fall its been a great basic
5,kids and grown ups love this ice cream whats not to like
5,i love this dress because it is everything i have been looking for it is flattering because of the details and it gives the illusion of an hourglass figure if you dont have one i love that it has sleeves because sometimes i just dont feel like finding a shawl or bolero or whatever in case i get suddenly anxious about my arms the green is dark and shimmering almost like lace over jewel tone emerald love
5,this is so good my husband and i both say it is the best soup i have ever made and i made no changes to the recipe
5,i love this shirt it is soft romantic and flowy i love the material it is probably one of the softest things i own great quality and lightweight
5,stop comparing witcher with game of thrones yes they were both based on books and they are both fantasy and both great thats it stop comparing further now for the show absolutely brilliant the fine touches and details that show the timeline is insane i like being a little bit challanged and not watch as a braindead a show the timeline is really simple if you just pay a little bit of attention i wont spoil things but man who cannot understand is clearly not fit for the story the casting is great i was afraid for ciri and yennifer but i was so wrong they are nothing like in the trailer geralt is perfect even the voice is perfect costume perfect fighting stances and moves perfect for someone who read the books i can say is exactly how i imagined when i was reading this is something they respected to books so good ive never been so proud about a show give it love and support cuz there is a lot more coming
5,excellent performancethank you
5,i love love love this swimsuit yes its a bit pricey for a bathing suit but i love the design and colors and the back detailing is sexy yet not all that revealing i cant wait to wear it in hawaii next month the only part to be careful about is not to stretch it too much when putting it on and taking it off i can see the diamond cutouts stretching or even ripping if pulled too hard by accident overall a great swimsuit for the summer
5,delicious used a whole bar of cream cheese as others suggested perfect that way everyone raved over how moist it waslots of recipe requests will definitely be making again
5,i made this cake the other day and passed out pieces to my friends now everybody wants the recipe excellent cake just the way it is no changes needed
5,ive ordered a pair of these from the catalog and loved them on my next visit to a store i picked up another color im now considering getting another pair while the free shipping deal is going on they are great pants with a great fit
5,i got this recipe in your best holiday recipes magazine it is wonderful i make it exactly by your recipe with the exception of the bake time i bake it hr min i have taken it to church many times and i get rave reviews its a keeper
5,i didnt think it was that cute in the picture online but when i saw it in the store i was in love i am typically a medium and this was true with this i have a dd chest and you can wear a strapless easily with it and it doesnt show i am going to wear it for a cocktail party but it would work with flip flops too just love it so happy i went into the store and saw it
5,such a amazing laptop for a this price but i was facing a problem for delivery boy are not good but overall product is awesome battery is amazing sound quality display even every thing is osm if any one chose this product i suggest this laptop thanku flipkart flipkart your delivery partner is bad he have a no manner to talk way of talking is so bad i think so many guys are facing this problem so short out this problem but overall all i love this product
5,this is excellent but i added a minced jalapeno and made it spicy cheeseburger soup
5,after reading previous reviews i definitely had to give this a try since i have broader shoulders than the average woman my regular size small was not available anymore so i went with medium and i have to say it worked out well the small would have not given me the slouchy factor that the medium gives me this top definitely has no problem staying off the shoulder since i have broad shoulders it doesnt completely come off me loving the bohochic vibe of this
5,its look is amazing
5,got it for kgreat deal at this price range gb ram gb ssd backlit keyboard battery back up hours cores looks super stylish super light weight super slim only thing which is average is its screensize
5,the best quality there is in memories is super fast wonderful and cantiad of gigas is very good the best brand and speed
5,the speaker volume is a bit on the low side but otherwise its the best bang for the buck you can get in this price range
5,big soft ginger cookies says it all i decided to dip them in white chocolate after they cooled they are wonderful i will be adding them to my christmas cookies this year very pretty
5,these are good i made them this year and last to give out to my neighbors for christmas my husband really enjoyed themi did have a problem though they came out puffy instead of chewy like i was hoping any idea why this would happen what did i do wrong thanks
5,best lasagna ive ever made my fiance always tells me all my other lasagna recipes have been bland but he loved this one gonna make it again this week
5,this is definitely a family favorite ive been making it for over a year but i too have made a few minor changes to it i use a onepound package of regular pork sausage instead of the turkey sausage links then to make up for the lack of italian flavor i added teaspoon of italian seasoning and to save time i also threw in a few handfuls of frozen spinach instead of dealing with fresh spinach like most soups it gets even better after it sits overnightassuming that it lasts that long
5,after reading the reviews about the batter being stiff i was a little concerned the catch is that the moisture from the apples cooking puts the added moisture in it is very moist and full of our favorite fall flavors apples cinnamon and nutmeg
5,it served its purpose no complaints i used it for my samsung device andi am still storing on it
5,this recipe is fabulous as written but still not simple enough for my teenagers to prepare without complaints when it is their turn to cook we usually use three cans of cubed potatoes and skip the fresh ones we usually use matchstick carrots so we dont have to chop if we use bacon we use real bacon pieces such as hormel like you can find in the salad section of the store we usually saute the carrot and onion in olive oil since i dont have bacon grease to use because i use canned potatoes i only heat it through before i add the ham and cheese the whole family loves this recipe and it is not unusual to make a double recipe so that we can enjoy it as leftovers
5,valuable laptop in this price range with good battery backupelegant design and powerful performance
5,i will be making these all the time now delicious
5,i love the cut and style of this simple striped tank its good fabric
5,excellent i made this for the super bowl one time and my family loved it i ended up leaving the salt and pepper out completely so everyone could add it to their taste and it still tasted amazing without it
5,i picked this maxi up in navy to go with my summertime capsule wardrobe that i will be doing extensive travel with this summer this dress is well made and fits my frame in a size m perfectly lbs c it is substantial enough to disguise any backside indiscretions and the halter style front does not expose the girls i do wear petals with this dress to ensure that i dont put on a show especially in air conditioned rooms this launders easily and doesnt look rumpled and wilted after
5,i love jeans especially this pair perfect fit hugs in all the right places perfect length worn it x already and it gets better every time you wear it goes great with a cute too
5,bought this for my nook hd and it works perfectly without any problems i already used about capacity with hd movies and my nook hd plays them flawlessly very happy with the product
5,love this top yes it is a swing top so you have to be prepared for the extra fabric fits true to size thru the shoulders and chest body of the top then flares for the swing effect great top plan on ordering it in the other colors
5,this is my favorite shirt to wear around the house its so soft and the waffle texture looks nice id definitely wear it for a run to the store or an evening walk around the neighborhood the fabric is thin but isnt too delicate and its not sheer which makes it a great summer lounge shirt the cut is flattering and the back doesnt show my bra which too many of this design do it is a bit large you may want to size down if you want it to be a bit more body conscious
5,such a great shirt loved the fit and how it feels i paired it with grey jeans loved it so much i ordered it in another color for myself and ordered one for a friend
5,lets begin with the fabricits heavy but not in a burdensome way as soon as you put it on you feel like you have a quality piece of clothing on next aestheticsthis dress is flowy and feminine and a bonus it made me look bustier than i am perhaps because of the stripes i didnt find myself pulling this dress up all the time once i put it on it stayed in place perfectly bottom line this dress goes from dressy to casual without a second thought and its on salegrab this one
5,now i have a lot more room on my phone it can be overkill for some but extra space is only wasted if you never use it
5,all ok you can buy it wont disappoint u
5,i got to try this on today and i really like it the fabric is a normal tshirt kind of fabric i was hoping it would have been kind of special and the vneck in the front does go down a ways so that some cleavage is showing i would feel comfortable wearing it asis outside of work but would have to pair it with a cami if i would going to wear it to work normally i am not a huge fan of vneck in the back and it drives me crazy thanks camis these days are often made with a versatile v and
5,item arrived in time as promised works well with a galaxy note there is nothing more to say about this product as it has been reviewed so many times it works well not a bad price at the time of ordering now it has come down yes you get the same card for lesser price from other sellers but i trust amazon for their customer service issues i prefer to pay bucks more and get it from amazon rather than getting it from unfamiliar sellers
5,very soft and recommended for babies relaxes the heartbeat a lot
5,display is good but speakers are not that loudbattery lasts for about hours gives smooth experience if used for simple tasks works great in samsung ecosystem
5,this chicken was delicious
5,this simple dress will turn heads it fits to the body hugging just in the right spots i love this dress it is soft and feels amazing on you can adjust the tie in the front i purchased the copper color but i have to say that is much more brown to me than copper a dark brown i still think the dress is adorable looks cute with booties or knee high boots winner
5,easy just throw in drum and thats it no messy liquid spill washes well and non bio
5,i tried this once after stumbling across it my family was amazed hard to find it again but so glad i didwrote it down this time
5,ive made this banana bread recipe so many times now that i have it memorized it lives up to its name and really is the best ever banana bread i have tasted all of my family agree
5,the sweater had a square fit it has a chiffon ruffle at the bottom which i didnt see in the picture
5,the repetitive murdering violence is very absurd it makes the story less realistic i hope montana laws dont actually allow a family to go around killing whoever they choose
5,i made these with glutenfree ingredients for a friend yum
5,liz i made it last night and used almond milk my husband loved it
5,fantastic i didnt shred my carrots and i added a few extra i got rave reviews at home
5,as an important message in the age of isis maga and similar human deviations this show is exactly what it needs to be relevant brave and important pure as a dramatic structure this show is thin superficial and pretentious woven from characters who arent really characters but onedimensional vehicles whose sole reason for existence is to convey the intended message total predictability factored in barely a as entertainment this show is a complete failure endless closeups of faces the rhythm and speed of a crippled snail irrelevant scenes that go nowhere generous in total it would be but the last two seasons have plunged even lower so the objective rating should be somewhere around
5,this is one of our favorite recipes we like it with hamgood way to use leftovers im going to do what one other reviewer did and try ricotta cheese this time since i have some i need to use thanks for recipe
5,absolutely scrumptious i am with the reviewer sillygirl i do not peel or seed my zucchini or squeeze out moisture i used a smallish tender zucchini the cupcakes turned out beautifully i wasnt sure about the frosting either although it turned out ok and tasted outrageously fabulous next time i will add cream cheese and more confectioners sugar to make the frosting more fluffy but still have that fabulous carmel taste the flavors are the best great recipe find thanks loved it
5,great recipe add more peaches i used cups other than that follow the directions there is one mystery in this recipe it list half and half cream but doesnt tell how much or when to use it i left it out amazing will make many more times
5,at first it took me a minute to catch on to the subtle humour well worth the wait this show is hilarious creat cast great writing great production keep up the great work to all involved well done
5,i can understand fans of dynasty or soap operas will enjoy this series i enjoyed it initially but it has become repetitive the whole series revolves around a morally corrupt family that lives in a world where nobody realizes people die or laws are broken therefore there are no repercussions for any ancillary deaths or destruction that is wrought by the family members we are asked to find sympathy towards the characters personal turmoil while they turn around and invoke it on others the characters are flawed but have superhuman abilities to avoid punishment for their actions i especially found characters like beth who arent particularly intelligence outsmart anyone solely on the basis of the writers expecting the intellect of their viewers to be less than a grade student i got sick of the repetition by the second season hoping things would become more real but sorely disappointed
5,im always searching for a dressed up tees and these were fabulous true to size and great quality
5,i made this soup and it is yummy
5,i made this and it was awesome it was super easy to prepare had good flavor and was just spicy enough i didnt add the chicken or shrimp i used smoked sausage and kielbasa i added more chicken stock just enough to cover it i will be repeating this recipe for years to come
5,this recipe was so easy and delicious i substituted smoked turkey sausage for the regular sausage
5,i used milk amp used all reduced fat cheeses amp sour cream amp this was great nice amp creamy thick amp rich great dish will definitely make again although i question it serving mine made a by baking dish amp when used as a side would easily feed maybe if it were the entree
5,the best apple pie i have ever tasted my homemade crust was pretty good also
5,this soup is very tasty my only problem is that the cooked wild rice didnt yield three cups i followed the package directions exactly but maybe i did something wrong i had never cooked it until using it in this recipe i ended up cooking some minute long grain and wild rice without the seasoning packet to add to it and that made it yummy other than that its a delicious hearty and low fat soup ill be making this one again
5,great read and write speed compared to my old transcend of course that was a class and this is a uhs i am very satisfied with the price i got it at and sandisk limited lifetime warrantyoh yeah i asked for the original manufacturers packaging but i got amazons frustration free packaging instead no big deal though
5,i want to upgrade the memory to my samsung note ii it is great to be able to instantly double my storage capacity i am waiting for the gb to down in price
5,these ar the best gingerbread cookie i didnt have any cloves so i used nutmeg and i also added a little more molasses and let them cool in the refrigerator they did not spread they came out perfect this is my go to gingerbread cookie recipe from now on
5,definite keeper my family loved this soup and it will be made again
5,lovely product with an amazing selection of music and sounds except the breathing one which sounded a bit creepy grandson loved it and fell asleep peacefully every night with his tiny fist touching the others tummy adorable gift for any child
5,the pattern attracted me to this top in store and when i tried it on i was pleasantly surprised it has a slight swing shape to it which i love im a cd and normally wear an or and bought this in a large the front buttons dont peek open and actually lays flat which is unusual for me with button up tops im actually wearing it today with some printed green shorts the stripes on this top make it easy to mix patterns too
5,boost the mp player size thanks more more if you have the music or videos can not go wrong with more memory

5,i got this for my samsung galaxy note after reading various reviews and comparing different micro sd cards i decided to get this one of the main reason was because of the speed of this card uhs the card has been good to me and im happy with my purchase
5,the fit is true to size the quality is nice i am happy to having this basic wardrobe staple added to my closet
5,love this its heavywarm stylish and a great throw on any outfit oversized style
5,i found this recipe doing a search for an easy beginners bread recipe i love this recipe it raises for me every time i have recently begun to experiment with it by making rolls and cinnamon rolls very simple very versatile recipe and it will stay in my favorite recipes notebook i will say to the naysayers get a candy thermometer and check your water temperature my coworker told me the easiest way to fail at bread making is to have your water or milk too hot when you add your yeast also check your yeast expiration date
5,this arrived in white at my store and it was so airy and dreamy i had to try it on this is the epitome of the effortless tank its a simple throw on with enough style that all it needs is your favorite pair of jeans and a cute necklace unfortunately it didnt quite work for me if you have any kind of tummy or chest size up i tried on my typical large but it was too tight and ended up looking like a maternity shirt on me however my coworker who is much more of a slimmer shape tried this on
5,this maxi is perfect the neckline is sexy but not too sexy yay for normal bra and the waistline is flattering the skirt isnt very full but the ruffle effect at the bottom gives it nice movement it could easily be dressed up or dressed down i cant imagine that this wouldnt be flattering on anyone it fit totally true to size for me
5,ok so i teach high school culinary amp one of my students chose this recipe for our rodeo baking contest not only did she win st place in her division she won best of show amp the judges were asking for the recipe the only change we made was the frosting we used the wilton buttercream icing recipe amp it was perfect
5,this is a great winter addition to any wardrobe warm but not hot looks great with tights as a dress or with leggings so many compliments
5,this is a favorite recipe the only change i make to it is that i mix up a package of alfredo sauce mix and add that to the pasta before serving with the scamp such an elegant dish that i serve to guests they will never guess it only takes minutes to prepare i have even made it for people who dont enjoy seafood and watched them go back for seconds would highly recommend this recipe with the addition of the alfredo sauce

5,very cute and well made fits true to size
5,wow product everything is perfect heavy machine excellent color production of screen super speed performance received excellent deal in bbd just k best product happy customer review after a week
5,i love cooking this recipe and my husband loves eating it i much prefer this stovetop version to my old standby which called for putting it in the oven the first time i made it was good but it was missing a little something i always added a bit of dried tarragon to my old recipe and so i did with this one as well perfect
5,i wore out a pair of level shorts a couple of years ago ordered these in the same size and they are huge so i am sending them in for exchange and hope im guessing right linen and tencel are my two favorite summer fabrics love the length which can be adjusted by rolling good pockets gorgeous somewhat dusty plum color belt loops if needed though i rather hope theyre not
5,i really loved the first few seasons but this last season is nothing more than a soap opera just like a soap opera characters are constantly crying getting angry getting hurt and being put into the same situations over and over they are in the hospital having secret encounters with old lovers making the same plans and their world is ending but always in a slightly different way yet their world doesnt end and they find themselves is the same situation no one learns lessons or makes better decisions everything is just recycled its old and exhausting if you miss soap operas this show is for you
5,i love this item ill wear it as a cover up or to dress up and go out the material is great for summer light and breathes i first ordered a small because the medium was sold out it fit too highwater i then ordered the large and it fits great the medium may have been fine too im
5,ive always been a pilcro fan and they always seem to fit just right this pair of velvety pants was no different lightweight velvet and a great cut yay
5,it was on the mother to bes registry and she loves it so

5,great item bargain price
5,out of this world easy to make and it was a big hit will make it again but will double the recipesrich but delicious
5,perfect way to add warmth in transition weather
5,i followed the changes the lady with vermouth and deglazing with white wine and this is the best clam chowder ever
5,listen i got the sandisk after i had a kingston card in my phone samsung galaxy note and it died after less than a year luckily my phone was synced to dropbox otherwise i wouldve lost valuable pics including our first summer family vacation so far so good with the sandisk its been a few months if theres a catastrophe ill update this review but as of right now its working really well
5,i tried on the regular size at my store wish stores close to me carried petites and it was jsut too overwhelming aka big i wanted to purcahse the petite however as i really like it striked out as they are sold out in my size bummer the cut is otherwise flattering and the sweater is really comfortable i like all the contrasting colors and patterns too
5,quality of this dress is excellent i ordered it in blue and the color looks exactly as it does online and the fit is exactly as it looks on the model i am lbs with an athletic build and ordered a small
5,i absolutely love this show discovered season earlier this year and then after episode i just had to binge the lot then to my absolute glee i read about another season and set in sicilyitaly too and season is just as thrilling and shocking and entertaining and fresh and beautiful to look at as season im so looking forward to more of the same in season if not more intrigue and shocking scenes thank you mike white for your original and fresh thought provoking writing and well done to hbo for green lighting more of the same in coming seasons i can see this show running and running
5,i am and athletically built and i usually have issues with dresses being long enough for me but this beauty has the perfect fit and perfect length it is very flattering the weight of the dress allows it to move with you it is formfitting but loose at the same time so your body doesnt look lost in the material you can dress it up with heels or wear it with boots or sandals to be a bit more casual
5,even at this kimono works for me because its so light in weight the length and amount of fabric are not at all overwhelming it can be dressy or casual as others have noted
5,from the images it looks like a basic black cardigan look again because its a beautiful fabric and can be dressed up or down im and always wear an xsmall at retailer however i thought it to wear over other articles vogue clothing id size up it fits perfect i did an xsmall petite and couldnt be happier
5,this is a very comfortable bralette the silk covers ones most sensitive parts so it feels like you are wearing almost nothing its very pretty too i wear a b bra and the small fits me it doesnt have a lot of support but its very comfortable for wearing at home or on errands the cups are a little far apart but it still works if youre looking for something pretty and comfortable for casual wear i would recommend this at the sale price
5,excellent fast and furious with incredible battery backup as well as consistent performance build quality is wonderful must have product note for better performance boost always disable google play services cos the performance difference is massive after doing so
5,jon favreau did a fantastic job here beautiful and well crafted series that binds nicely in the star wars story and gives more depth to it highly recommended
5,great gift
5,i am always on the hunt for a white shirt that is not too sheer so that i can wear it without a cami underneath on that count this top is a winner regarding the fit it is a shorter top so i am not sure that it would be able to be tucked in a bottom for most people i am short waisted and i wouldnt be able to tuck it in in fact i think it is really meant to have an almost cropped fit fyi c d broad shouldersback short waist in a fitted shirt i take a but i tried this
5,turned out great easy and tasty thanks for sharing
5,super cute otter that our daughter months old got at christmas the sound effects are good but we prefer the one from my hummy all in all i would order it again immediately super cute cuddly toy also suitable for bigger children because it is very big
5,wow i have been waiting long time for a show that keeps me watching more so far the mandalorian has done a fantastic job i am just counting days to watch the next episode they are slowly building the story the cast and story is fantastic easily best show of and has potential to become one of the the best ever just hope they dont disappoint us as the season progresses
5,this is a great top not cheap but funky it would look nice on any figure the two blacks on my top are more alike than the picture shows great value for a pretty party top but it can go anywhere
5,works great in my note ii no issues reads and writes fast no corrupted files and my note ii had no issues reading this card my friend bought an off brand card because it was cheaper and every so often he gets a card not found error good buy
5,love this soup making another pot today
5,i bought this dress to wear as a casual summer staple i like classic things with a twist and this fits the bill it is nice quality and the colors are vivid it is slightly tight in the bust line for me but it is not retailers fault that i am a bit too busty for this dress ill deal with it otherwise the dress is nice quality and will come in handy throughout summer the price is right so grab it
5,i dont ever do ruffles im a ddd but these laid so nicely and the vertical ruffle is very flattering for a less than flat tummy the knit back is so soft and makes this easy to wear it will be easy to dress up with a necklace blazer and dressy pants but it will go just as nicely on its on with jeans for a casual look if there had been the mint color in my size i would have gotten it too
5,does anyone really need this much space hard to say after about gbs of pictures and gbs of music i started to wonder myself if it was really necessary but then i realized i had forgotten about adding movies gbs of movies later i can definitely say i dont need this card and really just wanted it for the fun of it but it is nice to have your entire collection of music in your phone for someone with a bigger collection then me im sure this card would be a godsend
5,this is the best potpie recipe i share this one alot
5,this was outstanding will make again i served it with corn bread which made it the perfect meal on a rainy fall day
5,i have made this soup many times over the years my husband likes mixing pasta with it and calls it mexican goulash the kids like topping it with shredded cheese and sour cream to fab the additional of the packet of ranch salad dressing is included with stir in the remaining ingredients to woolyhobbies its obvious you havent made the soup and are only injecting your personal opinion about salt consumption why dont you create your own low sodium version and post it to be reviewed i appreciate the reviews and comments from those who actually made the dish and gave an honest opinion there are some great suggestions given for variations that make this a very versatile recipe
5,i made this breakfast casserole for a staff breakfast at work it was super easy to make i prepped the bacon and onions the night before and then threw the rest together and baked it in the morning before work everybody loved it and a few people asked for the recipe it literally disappeared within a few minutes no leftovers
5,this is one of those why we shop at retailer dresses this dress arrived today via lasership in an actual box both deliveries from this service far surpass fedex ups and certainly usps which crams an expensive item in an unprotected plastic bag into the mailbox okay off my soapbox and thanks for the free shipping weekend raspberry is quite beautiful truly as pictured the lacework should be more resilient than many the shape is reigned in by the bodice not elastic btw and the
5,omg so comfortable and feels like wearing nothing at all i wish the blue print was still available in my size tried them on at the store and fell in love they say the length is however i am on the tall side usually wear in jeans but these are perfect i see from other reviews that these pants have been around for a while please dont change them and i will be getting another pair or two next year

5,family favorite i add eggs because its an egg casserole i use spicy chicken sausage instead of bacon sometimes
5,worth for students
5,we use persin nonbio washing liquid all the time it is by far the best washing liquid for sensitive skin i suffer from eczema and have tried all sorts of sensitive skin washing liquids powder but persil is without a doubt the best comfort adds a little bit of softens to the whole mix and makes the clothes softer thus easier to wear removing the little bit of stiffness that can irritate very sensitive skin
5,this is a must have way cuter in person love the look and feel it runs large so size down its more cream than white
5,superb product he value for money
5,these are so good they have moved into the favorite category i dont change anything
5,i have been so blessed and busy with life that i jumped on the wednesday bandwagon a little later then expected while the social media world had me nervewracked as i did not want to see any spoilers flipping through tiktok especially made it difficult with all the amazing trends going around but when life finally gave me a chance to sit back and watch the most anticipated show for me in a long time i was extremely pleased kept me on the edge of my seat had me suspecting everyone what a amazing job tim burton never fails to deliver jenna played this role exceptionally well bravo
5,a favorite i have never made this for company without being asked for the recipedont need to tweak a thing
5,i prefer the san disk brand over other types this is a great size for phones cameras i would buy again
5,lots of stretch in fabric so pants fit well length is perfect for me im almost ft in and they hit at bottom of ankles with slightly extra fabric so flats heels or boots work great with these pants i bought size and im lbs colors in pants are beautiful many different colored tops go well with them
5,ive never had so many compliments and requests for recipes as ive had with these yummy cupcakes they were a hit with adults as well as kids at our church potluck it tends to make more than cupcakes which was fine with me definately a keeper in my recipe box
5,have made this many timesthe family requests it for all our get togetherswe prefer it with green chilies and cheddar cheese addedyummy
5,since there isnt one where i live i ran into retailer while waiting for my daughter to pick me up saw this and bought it off the rack wout trying on had to get a m as they were out of s and yes its a tad large on me but still glad i got it i think it will be a nice transition piece into fall in hot texas love how the linen drapes and it makes me feel a bit more dressed up than a cotton tee the ruching on the sleeves is an extra nice touch
5,this was very good i used black beans instead of pinto and the johnny cake made it all a great combo
5,delicious quick and easy i would definitely make again
5,i never ever buy anything full price when it comes to retailer shopping love their stuff but way over priced so i patiently watch and wait this dress though i couldnt do it i had to have it i think it is a fabulous addition to my summer collection and i look forward to wearing it in a few weeks to a july th get away get it while you can
5,best gaming laptop excellent laptop excellent performance
5,this will be my goto shirt for fall its a great layering piece with just enough detail to make it different than a plain crew neck long sleevethe neckline is unique the slit in the back of the shirt adds interest fit is slim nicely tailored which makes it perfect for layering i will likely purchase more colors once on sale i purchased the dark grey and color is just as expected my only drawback is how thin the material is i can see it getting snags or holes easily but i will deal
5,bear with me here i know yellowstone and mad men are chalk and cheese in terms of their similarities but i watched mad men and i thoroughly enjoyed it but even after all these years i dont know why nothing ever really happened yellowstone is a bit like that for me some incredible performances some amazing scenery but nothing much happens but can i stop watching no do i want to stop watching hell no the only thing i wished is that it wasnt so addictive im staying up way too late binge watching it yes its am yes i have work in the morning ah sod it ill watch one more
5,i dont understand the negative review on this sweater it is nothing short of stunning the quality and design are absolutely beautiful and i love the lined pockets i can honestly say i dont think ill ever part with it this is a sweater you hang onto forever i will say it runs a bit large i ordered the xssm and if i didnt know better i would think its ml either way if you can you get your hands on one in store or a return online do it it is worth every penny especially for the s
5,ok so this coat is amazing its high quality soft great pattern the knit lining helps to make this more of a light weight coat than a sweater type coat its been warmer this season so ive worn it as a coat and received many compliments it might not be warm enough for january in new england but i bought a size up so i could wear it over a sweater and still use it as a coat this was purchased on sale w off sale code so for me that was a steal so happy it went on sale give it a try
5,all issues are solve time to time so dont think purchase it this product is very good for study purpose
5,cute colored jeans ordered the sky color when it arrived the color was a medium moss green color the color was beautiful but was expecting a light blue so sadly i returned them
5,i just bought this and really think it is a great dress it is conservative and i will be able to wear it to teach or play the organ at my church i am a church organist and college professor and need conservative clothes yet i do not like to look frumpy this is cute and chic yet conservative also j got because it is black friday thank you retailer
5,i made this bread yesterday the bread is really really good my husband loved it everything is ok in the recipe except that the butter is part of the ingredients for the bread and not for glaze i know its only a mistake but maybe this information can be help to others
5,great recipe and an easy one whenever i have left over roasted chicken i make this dish i dice the carrots instead of slice and dont add the corn other than that follow recipe exactly perfect consistency to the sauce
5,this dress is wonderful word to the wise it says that you can machine wash the dress on cold which i did the dress came out fine but the slip is now basically a shirt there are no washing instructions on the slip but i assumed it would be the same it is not it still looks ok under the top part but i will have to wear a half slip under the bottom
5,obviously amazon wanted to buy a beloved character to capitalize on the fan base generated by the books from lee child and with his younger brother andrew for their series to be an instant success and it was as season delivered a fairly faithful reacher and story from its source material however as has been mentioned season delivers neither of these things save for the hulking presence of alan ritchson while ritchson inhabits the physical characteristics of reacher the screenwriters did not give the book series fans the intelligent award winning sniper military policeman that his readers expected especially after s whereas childs character is physically imposing hes also very smart knowledgeable even a numbers guy a leader of special investigators when it comes to physical confrontations hes brutal and efficient even the more diminutive tom cruise better represents the reacher brawling style in the muchmaligned movie adaptations amazons s reacher is determined but hes not a thinking man and relies more on handguns his accuracy significantly less than the top sniper he is in the books for some reason neagleys character is given the real sharpshooter skills i dont know whether season will be more liked by tv viewers overall or not perhaps the character amazon has created is more appealing to those not familiar with the book character but this reader would prefer if the series continues a return to lee childs reacher in season
5,this is a hit everytime i make it ive given it to my sister who now also makes it often we both sometimes use chicken breasts instead of thighs
5,very nice laptop nice working
5,how many times can people insult june elizabeth moss why do the bad reviewers focus all their anger on her i wonder the handmaids tale started in a desperate time for women offering some solace that there were good people out there that got it while america was fighting sexism again in the third wave of feminism thanks to increasing economic and social tensions everywhere women were retreating to their comfortable acceptable roles just like were taught to do when times get tough and its not over which is why im so glad this show is continuing too there are so many ways that the handmaids tale speaks about sexism womanhood parenting marriage religion and politics and it tells those stories mainly through women as it should be but it does it in a realistic way without demeaning men or women nor elevating one above the other it is simply a story about people behaving in realistic ways in difficult circumstances by now most people probably know that the handmaids tale is set in a dystopian future where women are kept in reproductive servitude this is both a fictional story and a metaphor for inequality and oppression of women in society i dont think it was meant to predict the future but to be a cautionary tale about why its important to keep fighting for womens rights and feminism the novel was written in the s which was also a really bad time for the movement after phyllis schlafly successfully lobbied against now and the equal rights amendment something that still hasnt passed today so actually this story has a place in american history as well as the history of feminism that being said this is a novel not explicitly a work of feminist theory its a really fantastically written story and the characters and acting are as good as it gets there are both men and women that are good and bad the characters are multidimensional and neither the good or the bad are completely evil or innocent aunt lydia in particular is somehow endearing in her determination to oppress yes season has moved a bit slower but i appreciate it they can take all the time in the world to tell this story for all i care because ill never get tired of it keep giving me more of the undying friendships and complicated motivations i think its fantastic
5,if anyone is wondering where we the u s could be heading in terms of cultural government watch this series i believe this is an accurate depiction of what life will be like under an authoritative hyper religious authoritarian regime todays extreme right evidenced by roe vs wade shows that given the opportunity would swiftly move to similar way of life as shown in this series hats off to the author the shows producers directors performers for such an awesome presentation i very important timely piece of work program my one complaint to the powers that be please complete a final season or film to help answer the many unanswered questions left
5,hard to get on hands and you think that you havent got enough but a very small amount keeps hair in place i think the three tubs will last a very long time
5,gorgeous dress soft silky material and flattering on most body types best purchase ive made at retailer in a long time i get compliments every time i wear it
5,my family loves these pancakes they are very light and fluffy and are made of ingredients we always have on hand we usually double the recipe and it makes about larger pancakes and we make these with tbsp of oil instad of the shortening like some of the other reviewers

5,even more beautiful in person runs large as im usually a medium and bought a small great for summerfall transition
5,these jeans really look very nice on they are cotton and elastaine if you want the look that you see on this model order one size up i am lbs bought both and decided to keep the mainly because the lower part of the leg was fitting too tight in the looked more like a skinny jean but bunched up at the knee they are tapered i also own a pair of cotton levis wedgie in foot hills in size which fit a bit different than these the foot hills definitel
5,what can i say that hasnt already been said almost everything about this is amazing the writing respects canon the pacing is good and the character growth is topnotch the score was fantastic as well it equally appeals to those who are new to star wars and to those who have been star wars fans forever you dont need star wars knowledge to enjoy the show but those who do have that knowledge will love it all the more just an example camtono if you know you know it has the perfect blend of action and drama and the series finale is a work of magic possibly my favorite series finale of all time outside of the original trilogy this is my favorite piece of star wars media
5,a very entertaining and captivating hbo series with eps it was the most successful miniseries of the last emmy ceremony with wins in almost all categories its a dark cynical satire about the pampered upper class their privileges transactional relationships and their petty problems it has an undercover vibe of the movie parasites to it besides the casting acting writing and cinematography the music score is amazing and controversial in a good way see why the score of the white lotus makes me feel anxious on youtube the humor is quite funny and the characters are very relatable well written and acted expect heavy laughter midway through watch the characters develop and the drama unfold when the house of cards comes tumbling down
5,my family and i followed this recipe and it was fantastic we used pipping bags and zip lock bags to put the chocolate and peanut butter into the mini cupcake cups this made it go very fast and easy we will be making these again
5,best laptop value for money i like it very much touch pad is fine and touchscreen is really good it is super i loves it
5,wow i have never owned a pair of pants that fit so well this is my first pair of pants from retailer i always have the too tight in the thighs and gaping at the waist issue but not with these at all i was so surprised i purchases size in both tan and blue the perfect amount of stretch and so comfortable a bit long but flares look best with heals anyway
5,my daughter is receptive to white noises so its an excellent way to fall asleep or calm hernevertheless i find thenoise volume not high for that i would give only stars
5,i purchased this in grey and wine and both are wonderful the boiled wool is light but warm and not itchy fits nicely through the bodice and flares out to create a nice shape the pockets are terrific and lay nice and flat im short but the petite was well above my knee i could have worn petite small just fine it fit nicely in the bodice the smaller size brought the seaming up a bit higher to form a more empire waist but i chose the petite medium because i wanted it loose through the wais
5,lovely product my first own laptop before this also i had laptop but it was like family laptop my bro sis use them but this is owned by me damn product
5,i could live in these jeans they are so comfortable they are have the perfect amount of stretch and the fabric is so soft i was skeptical because that usually means they lose their shape and im yanking on them all day however i have worn them days now and on the third day they may have stretched a little in the waist i am normally a but can get away with sometimes i chose the and felt the fit was perfect by the way im wearing the jeans with the cubanas ciara glitter boots
5,works perfect in my note this card even writes almost as fast as my internal phone storage it works much better than cheap chinese cards ive also tried it in my go pro and it has plenty of write speed even enough for shooting in k i highly recommend it and will definitely be getting another soon
5,i gave it to a friend and shes absolutely thrilled
5,love how this fits length is great so i didnt need to hem you wouldnt be able to flattering on muscularathletic legsbottom i bought in navy and then had to buy it in another color it fit so well
5,i humbly request if you didnt watch yet please do this is the star wars weve been waiting for this takes us back to the old days the acting and cinematography is just brilliant highly recommend all star wars fans to watch this asap

5,good recipe i used a can of crushed tomatoes with puree instead of processing diced tomatoes and paste
5,this taco soup was delicious i added hot chilies to it to make more spicy i also made vegetarian by using plant based crumbles instead of meat
5,i have used recipes on taste of home for years and never left a review before now this soup is amazing i made it exactly as written and my large family loved it i used leftover grilled chicken ff sour cream and lowfat cream of chicken soup absolutely amazing will make againand againand again i may add sauted onion and celery next time but it was wonderful as is
5,simply fantastic used italian sausage instead of ground beef too easy
5,i was looking for a cream soup to use in casseroles and stumbled upon this i just made it an its quick and delicious i followed the recipe exactly except i only had canned mushrooms in the house and yes i used those its still really good and beats the heck out of canned soups with canola oil and gmos in them i blended it with my immersion blender at the end to make the mushrooms smaller i did this for use in casseroles and the consistency is great next time i might add another tablespoon or of flour to make it thicker or reduce the liquid make sure you wisk the flour into the stock really well before adding it to pot and boil for a full minutes to cook out the flour taste i will definitely be using this recipe in the future and next time i will get fresh mushrooms looks like enough for casseroles so i will freeze the rest thanks
5,a dark world where madmen rule a new nation gillead they went from democracy to a tyranny that bring back the social discrimination women are beneath men no matter what they were before in the free world a system that treats fertile women as sex slaves that are to produce children under the gods eye everywhere there are spies and under watch for anyones action against the rules the costumes are simple but great as they can pass you the whole vibe of this world women depending their status wear green as they are the aristocracy brown as they are the help of the house and red as they are the slaves that can produce offsprings to their masters and then tossed to another family the characters of this show are amazingly well written and there is chemistry between their interactions the heroine of the show has the greatest character evolution as she tries to cope with all the craziness and abuse that takes place she even admitted that she isnt the same woman as she was before and by watching the series you can understand that the plot is linear with a good pace and evolution
5,this is very simple and tasty you wouldnt know its a healthy soup by the indulgent taste i made it with milk and its still delicious
5,searched for a laptop for very long time
5,finally a swing top that doesnt look like a sack on me ive been wanting to partake of this current style but everything ive tried so far just looks dumpy on me not this top it is very feminine and flattering i am lbs and have a small waist and although this is a swing style it still shows my waist and doesnt overpower me it is also a lovely fabric especially in the soft pink which i got im thinking of going back for more colors
5,and this is my update like others i had faced frequent shutdown issues one thing which worked for me was the cloud reinstall of os and updated drivers which did the trick for me and solved the issue
5,i got this to go in my smart phone and it does the job great inexpensive and it includes an adaptor card so i can use it in applications without a microsd slot this expands its versatility
5,i made this and it is amazing the sauce is the best served wfried rice i used tb minced garlic and ginger instead of powdered thanks for sharing
5,good product dont be carried away by some bad reviews this is a gaming laptop so dont expect a very good battery and even if it had one the battery consumption would be high due to graphic card the graphic card performance is decent value for money tho you get around fps in warzone ultra settings dlss ultra and around in pubg basically it can run all tripe a title games in playable fps but dont try ray tracing tho make sure you install the game ready driver from ge read more
5,love this top with swingloose tops i always size down im b and took a it fit very well i tried a on as well and i could see what the other reviewers were saying about the top part not laying flat so size down if you can i got white so i use a nude bandeau bra with it works well
5,i just discovered this dress a few days ago and its simply dreamy id been searching for the perfect summer dress to wear to a wedding in june but had been highly disappointed in the selection of pastel colors from other shops this dress is the perfect summer shade and will be perfect for the texas heat in june i absolutely love how it flows and is elegant yet modest the lace cutouts are gorgeous
5,it is easy to use as we have seen that the batteries can be changed quickly and easily without any danger for the baby quality fisherprice does not failour nephew is now weeks old and we have always had trouble to make him sleep he arrived teddy in the morning and we tried it at noon and we are delighted after minutes where he was fighting against himself because he did not want to sleep he had lost the fight heh and in the evening he blabs briefly but sleeps in minutes high recommended as a gift to newborns and for your own baby fantastic and monisimo soft to no more
5,i have been having the worst trouble lately finding cute comfortable cotton undiesuntil i found these these fit like a charm are incredibly soft and dont ride up at all sizing in spot on plus they have the adorable lace trim that makes one feel nice and girly last summer there was a nyt article saying that comforable underwear was coming back in style yay
5,made this to take to a friend it was sooo good and shes still talking about it
5,how could this not be flattering to every figure bunching of fabric is awesome at hiding imperfections i know i have become a master at hiding some of my residual baby weight for years now this paired with a darker color and not black yay makes for a perfect combination in a dress i love that this is a deep purple it is a dark color which is slimming but in addition it has more appeal being colored and it is so versatile wear it along or with a cardiganjacket on top heels or boo
5,i made this alongside a traditional chili for a winter gathering and this chili stole the show i was expecting leftovers for additional meals during the week but nope no leftovers its mild but theres always ways to spice it up if thats your preference if youre thinking about it just do it its easy fast warming and delicious oh and might as well double it i did
5,loved this online and even better in person inner lining is like a cozy sweatshirt
5,the torso runs a bit long but this is otherwise a comfortable and cute dress
5,this was really easy and quite tasty i did use a few more tortillas three per layer and used lb of turkey and lb of ground beef also no black beans or green pepper on hand so i doubled the refried beans topped with shredded lettuce and sour creamyum
5,i used celery seed instead added some grated carrot to add color doubled recipe for large head of cabbage since we like real creamy this recipe beats my mothers recipe and i always loved her slaw
5,like the previous reviewer stated its more like a cape id to call it a capedigan style super comfy loose fit for comfort fabric high quality just right thickness not too thick not too thin snuggly soft doesnt pill with wear design totally retailer cute and quirkiness top of the back has the same gray as the sleeve for continuity and the sleeve has sheep and a fence how cute is that this is a very versatile sweater goes with everything and so comfortable that i reach for
5,i ordered this dress in two colors and im happy that i did very cute and great fit flattering too
5,love this as a lightweight coat for cool to cold days i love the squishy soft feel of the material it works well with sweaters love the deep pockets which works with my iphone plus and wallet i love how simple and practical this coat is the hood when not used as a hood makes a nice collar for the neck and head
5,this show follows the story the infamous shelby family and their attempt at rising up through the ranks of british society from the details in the storyline to the plot and its many twists this show is easily one of the highest priority on any binge watching list i personally cannot remember a show that intrigues well beyond its min per episode run time to the point where watching a single episode just isnt enough
5,tasty easy to prepare i added some stir fried celery onion bell pepper and green beans
5,despite my relative novice level this turned out good what made me select this recipe is the homemade bread tips that taste of home provided i enjoyed the simplicity which made the recipe more approachable my first attempt was a fail and was completely my fault because i didnt check the expiration date on my yeast which i knew after reading the tips the second attempt was so much better and gives me hope that i can get even better results i didnt have bread flour so i just used regular allpurpose flour my family enjoyed the bread as well
5,he looks totally cute and not only soothes babies or children
5,this dress is very forgiving on my post baby body im glad i purchased the petite it hits my ankle perfectly im very versatile i can see wearing this at work with a blazer or on a weekend
5,really easy to make and very tasty only thing is the ingredients doesnt mention vanilla but the directions does
5,the lappy is small and lighter as per my assumption the overall performance is far better as compared to the others in my wish list
5,i didnt buy it for the longest time based on the other reviews but i finally did and i love it great color great quality great fit oh and great price too i say go for it
5,the very best chowder ever friends loved it too and we all will be making it many times nice big batch for company didnt change a thing
5,every year i make this with thanksgiving leftovers and every year i am so glad i did i usually get pies out of this recipe depending on the size i make and they freeze beautifully i love always having one on hand for a night i dont feel like cooking and can just pop one in the oven for a few hours and walk away
5,music and sounds great my grandson loves him
5,fabulous i receive tons of raves with this i mixed it all together instead of layering it and then put it in my crockpot and cooked on low my crockpot runs pretty hot for four hours i buttered my crockpot really well first and that seemed to help keep it from sticking too bad i took it to the party and left the crockpot on warm for several hours and it worked out just fine everyone said that id have to make that everytime we get together and no one even guessed or realized that it was gluten free a true feat for us celiacs note its also a meal unto itself so as a celiac at a social function you know you can have a full meal in just the one safe dish
5,nice performance
5,fantastically delisious so very flavorful without the crazy spice will be making many times over thank you
5,this was the best apple pie i have ever tasted in my life i made it exactly as written so simple and nobody believed i made it thank goodness my daughter witnessed it thanks so much

5,i havent made it yet but sounds promising
5,super soft comfy underwear i sized up and they fit perfectly normally wear xs and bought m for most comfortable fit they dont ride up i ended up ordering more pairs super comfy without being too mom like
5,when i first saw the bees embroidered pullover in the store it instantly caught my attention since it was pricey i didnt get it when it went on sale it ran out in my size so recently i was fortunate enough to get the same style embroidered birds pullover in the store for off the sale price this shirt looks so adorable on and is different than the typical sweatshirt
5,this card works perfectly all i had to do was format it and pop it into my galaxy s now i use it to keep some movies and all of my music on my cell phone
5,the product is awesome but the battery is not working so longer
5,my motherinlaw suggested that we have a corn dish for thanksgiving i had seen this recipe and volunteered to make it it was very good a definite keeper
5,really good price
5,i ordered this top in a size m as i heard mara hoffman runs small the size chart on her site would have me order a size s as i have a bust however my bra size is a d or c and the size m is what fit therefore a m might also fit a b and a a as the back is adjustable it even stays up without the halter which is highly unusual for me the only negative that really disappointed me is that the patterns are not quite symmetrical as i expect from this brand and from t
5,it has some great moments but was dragged down by predictable dialogue and characters however it was an easy watch and likable in a disney sort of way if you are looking for that sort of thing with a throw back feeling go for it but if edgy is your style this will not fit the bill i personally prefer something like this to be darker with a bit more comedic breaks i definitely did not like the the carrie ripoff dance scene i can see where many viewers will enjoy this especially since the cinematography and sound were exceptional netflix made a good choice in remaking the addams family theme in this way its popularity is sure to bring on a second season which i hope they will tweak to be a little more to my liking
5,i was surprised how much i like this shirt the fit is really pleasing at first i thought it would be a whatever shirt but i think i will actually wear it a lot more it will look cute dressed up with a cute necklace and flats the price is a bit high for this top but i felt it was worth it since it is so hard finding a casual shirt thats not your basic tee
5,this is an amazing recipe my kids say its only missing the chocolate chips
5,i have a number of sweaters from moth and they never disappoint the ones made with this ultra soft and warm yarn are my favorite i bought both colors i wear it with jeans or dressier clothes id say its very versatile
5,i got he green color with gray accent stitching looks awesome with gray tone leggings super soft definitely runs a little big lbs i ordered the small but not in an unflattering way
5,best ever banana bread with a few changes cup granulated sugar and c brown sugar and i cup of sour cream insted buttermilk
5,my husband and i both agree this was delicious next time i will make a double batch so i can share it with family thank you mmb
5,this is a great recipe to introduce people to how delicious gluten free can be be careful though when this is fresh out of the oven some might lose control
5,real good with vanilla ice cream
5,overall good experience

5,i installed the memory in my new galaxu s and it gave me plenty space no worries anymore about lack of space to take pictures or video

5,i never write reviews but these are amazing in fact this is the first review i have ever written because i never think its worth it but these cookies are worth writing a review for if you are thinking about making them do it
5,they did in three seasons what it took game of thrones eight seasons to do ruined it by incorporating mindless writing entwined with personal ideology with a huge dose of not knowingcaring what the audience want sad to see another series blown away because of egos and politics the first season was a ten the second was a seven with giving the last season to have zero stars this could have rivaled game of thrones the walking dead and friends it is obvious netflix is more into creating a payday series then riding the royalties of decline all the way to the bank like companies have with so many other creations in the hollywood handbook they seem to go with the old saying fix it until its broke
5,these are delicious and are often requested at my house

5,recently i bought a microsoft surface rt tablet and used the gb version of this memory card worked great and i didnt have any problems so when i heard that the surface rt could be expanded to gb i immediately looked for a great deal online behold amazon offered this card for under and it was prime eligible woohoo to me it was a nobrainer and i quickly ordered this inexpensive upgrade like its predecessor it comes with the memory card an sd card adapter and a small plastic case installing the card is super easy on the surface because you just line it up with the slot and push it in till it clicks thats it no formatting required and the card runs quite fast normally i buy sandisk extreme memory cards which are faster but this particular card had no problem running video files or playing musicanyway if you get this card for your surface rt tablet dont format it why well the card is already formatted so why risk messing up your card just pop it in and enjoy greater space on your surfacenote as far as i know you cannot install surface apps onto the memory card only media files and documents still this card is a great upgrade and i highly recommend it

5,best strawberry cake ever i made this as a birthday cake with an additional lemon cake layer per the request of my yearold daughter moist homemade flavor even though its from a box and has flavored gelatin i was skeptical but now throughly impressed it was a real hit i use a good avocado oil for baking instead of canola or veg oil i used a food chopper to chop strawberries they were perfect not too fine and not too big i used the frosting recipe ingredients only but with different measurements plus added cream cheese to it and made it as a filling between the layers not nearly as sweet that way as others had mentioned and frosted with white icing i tripled this recipe and baked it in a x x pan only used about of the recipes instead of the full tripled amount to fill the pan it came out perfect i used nonstick spray on pan as well as the parchment paper and sprayed paper do not let cake cool completely in pan only cool cake about min on a cooling rack took a knife and wen along the edges of the pan to release any possibly stuck sides i noticed that the gelatin with the sugar may stick a little bit but its not bad then placed another piece of parchment paper on the top of the cake placed cooling rack on top of the cake and while holding both cooling rack and pan flipped cake over and let it sit for a moment shook gently removed pan nothing stuck just a thought but usually cant go wrong when a cake recipe begins with mamaw
5,this is an amazing memory chip card at less than half the size of a regular postage stamp this card fits my garmin gps and allows me to take oodles of photos along for viewing and it comes with an adapter to allow using it in my pc with one of the many multicard readers gigabytes in such a tiny card and at a very reasonable price highly recommended

5,i ordered this dress in navy for fall and it is now easily the most darling and figure flattering dress in my wardrobe i am lbs and size in jeans i usually wear a size small but ordered a medium based on reviews that said this dress runs small and i like that the medium is a little longer and slightly blousy making it more modest but the small would have worked just fine for a slightly more figureaccentuating look the fabric hangs beautifully and has a silky feel the navy flower
5,after watching the entire series through to i did think it was far closer to the original trilogy than any of the other movies or tv series i wouldnt say there was any spectacular acting going on but it was adequate pedro pascal seems to play the mandalorian like hes not bothered or hes got something else he should be doing i suppose its difficult to act in a helmet all the time though i must admit the story lines did remind me of the ateam at times when the mandalorian had to save a village there was a few other times when i thought the same thing its borderline ateam i did get a sense the characters didnt really develop and you were introduced as if you already knew them some of the costumes looked decidedly dodgy to me as well captain teva xwing pilot looked more like he should have been rodding out drains then flying an xwing that costume either didnt fit him or suit him at all then again they made boba fett look like uncle fester when he takes his helmet off but noone mentions that all that said the characters did still hold my attention and the storylines flowed quite well i wouldnt t say top marks but it did give you a bit of hope that there are some good star wars movies series to watch

5,i bought this in late august and have been wearing it ever since i love that you can wear it either on or offtheshoulder the second option adds sexiness even though the top is flowy comfortable and easy to wear on the shoulder ive even worn it to work on casual friday the print is versatile and i like that the fabric has a little heft while still being soft and drapey i definitely recommend especially since i notice it is now on sale it is generously sized so id recommend erring
5,i am very satisfied would be even better if it was still a sound quieter but otherwise the otter is really recommended
5,everyone loves this recipe i make a dish of it for my family and a dish for a friend its a great hearty twist on spaghetti
5,just made the cake for a birthday in a darth vader shaped cake pan and it came out beautifully and made a dozen cupcakes with the leftover batter its very moist and was such a hit this recipe is definitely a keeper
5,this was a great recipe the only change was substituting mayonnaise for the miracle whip everyone loved it no leftovers
5,very flattering cut very loose flowy runs a little big for a small but fits well for someone who sometimes fits medium depending on the cut i need to wear a bralette with this top
5,i started using ceraves facial lotion a few months ago and since had constant breakouts which isnt the norm for me wanting to love the product i persisted until very recently when i decided enough was enough i picked up this simple one and its the best thing ive done within two days not only have my current spots begun to clear the overall look of my face is so much calmer just goes to show that all the fancy long named sciencey products dont always come up on top over simple and gentle products like this one
5,i bought this in black and the checkered pattern love both very floaty and feminine fits true to size
5,everyone really loved this i marinated chicken breasts for a few hours in this i forgot to add the lemon juice and used regular kosher salt because thats what i had on hand then i cooked the chicken on the grill i didnt marinate the peppers but will next time also will try it with shrimp and will do the chicken peppers and onions on one sheet pan all together if im not grilling
5,i now have this tee in colors partly because my daughter loves and shares them with me i typically get a size medium because i like things to fit a little loose but needed a small in this shirt goes great with all styles of jeansknakis
5,the pictures of this sweater do not do it justice i would have passed it over online but it immediately caught my eye in the store the yarn is soft and cozy and the flair at the bottom adds a feminine touch zipper is cute vneck is just right it is not too low i know i will be wearing this sweater a lot very happy with this purchase i didnt see the pink or navy in the store

5,wonderful quick recipe this ones going into the tried and true file
5,this piece is gorgeous in person it is more of a broen than taupe and goes with everything it is more of a coat than a sweater i bought one for my mom and picked one up for myself when it went on sale it is moms favorite piece among her extensive retailer collection
5,adorable skirt the eyelet part on the bottom is cutout so see through but cute and subtle found it fit a little snug on me could just be my build but i ordered it in normal size and size up the size up fit best
5,netflix is synonymous with producing some over rated rubbish wednesday though its simply the best series i have seen on the netflix platform or that on a whole i absolutely loved jenna otegas portrayal of wednesday addams she is a fine actress whom im sure we havent seen the end off the series had a predictable ending but that aside it was so magical dark and brought out a softer side of wednesday yet keeping that cold emotionless character that christina ricci developed in the two films in the s bringing ricci into the series didnt undervalue it nor was it necessary to add value to it the acting alone from the principal characters made it a worthwhile enjoyable watch lets hope there is a series
5,wonderful pound cake like texture great flavor tweaked a bit used oil instead of butterprefer a finer crumb healthcalorie benefitsalso used pulp from lemons as well to pump up flavorno nuts in pantrythank you for a great recipe
5,my husband loved it ill serve it at our next small group from church in weeks
5,i stuck with the first series and needed to as some of the acting bits of the script were dire but im glad i did as the second third series were great very much improved on both scores though you really do need to suspend belief with a couple of the storylines kelly reilly steals every scene shes in is the standout of the show though kevin costner gives her a run for her money all in all its very watchable and if you like got succession the sopranos to see feuding families ripping each other to pieces then youll like this
5,one of the best soups ive eaten im sure i will make it often
5,lovs this products
5,s to s was atleast bearable to watch although they were the stupidiest thing ive ever seen but my god s was almost unbearable to watch with bad acting bad writing as they have given the task to year old boy to write a story for them and bad direction with zero character building it seems everything is working perfectly for shelby family as tommy shelby have dramatically escpaed death about three or four times out of nowhere for all those who think that this show is masterpiece must watch the sapranos the wire boardwalk empire to get even the slightest idea that what is meant by masterpiece
5,this is a very well made top i like the cut and it fits true to size very nice quality and the colors schemes are unique im happy with this purchase
5,turned out great
5,i really liked this dress online and i loved it in person the print is different the waist is synched skirt is full has a very feminine shape definitely a special piece runs large im usually a in dresses and an in skirts im s c and then was noticeably too big size fit perfect and im no size no sleeves will make if easy to add a denim jacket or a cardigan it hits approx above the knees but has a conservative high neckline and back is covered good quali
5,got this shirt on sale and i hope they restock so i can buy more super comfy and flattering at the same time i have some extra baby weight and it camouflages that well im normally a but im an right now and the medium was perfect im and its plenty long enough to wear with leggings a great shirt and ill be sure to watch out for this one to come back please restock
5,excellent display
5,gorgeous skirt received so many compliments the colors are perfect to match with many topsjacketssweatersas well as different shoesboots bringing out the colors i unfortunately ordered a large thinking it ran small and the large is too big in the waist so i will try to have it tailored i like my skirts fuller in the hip area i hope retailer offers more of this type of item just adore it for size i am a in bottoms but since the skirt looked slim with out lining i ordered a large
5,this skirt is gorgeous i love the dots the heavy fabric the slight metallic in the weave it also has two exposed zippers one on either side of the waist which gives it an edgy vibe a perfect counter balance to the s circle skirt cuteness however not knowing my size in tracy reese i ordered my usual retailer size i cannot even zip it i measured it and the size has a inch waist there is about an inch of give in the band but the elastic is so heavy it would not be flattering to
5,these tailored front flowy back tops dont always work this is long enough to wear with leggings and quite flattering

5,with the mandalorian jon favereau and dave filoni gives us one of the most emotionally impactful and engaging stories in live action star wars underneath all the exciting action sequences and space battles the mandalorian is a surprisingly heartfelt story and an indepth character study of the titular character as he forms an unlikely friendship which gradually brings out the humanity within him despite his face being covered by a helmet for the entirety of the show pedro pascal as din djarin delivers an exceptional performance as he overcomes this limitation by making use of his voice performance body language and gestures pascal was able make us connect with his character so well and gave us one of the most memorable and complex characters in the star wars universe the way in which he uses body language and how he modulates his voice according to different emotions is particularly noteworthy the child or baby yoda as he is commonly known evolves from a mere mcguffin to the true heart of the show since his relationship with din becomes the central focus of the story the development of the bond between them over the course of two seasons and the resulting changes it brings about in din slowly transitioning him from a coldhearted assassin to a kind and caring father to the child forms the core of the story giancarlo espocito provides another remarkable performance as he plays arguably the most intimidating and compelling villain in live action star wars since darth vader he proves that villains dont always require complex backstories and overexplained motivations to be memorable and engaging with season the show takes some unexpected directions as it expands the world much further establishing connections to previous star wars media the moments of fan service which are many in number have been integrated well into the story and does not come across as cheap or out of place the show is visually gorgeous and ludwig göranssons score is also a noteworthy aspect both the season finales were the standout episodes of the show the presence of filler episodes are understandable since the show follows an episodic format however certain episodes felt like filler for the sake of filler particularly season episode and season episode as they are the weakest episodes in the show also this contained episode format makes the show feel slightly predictable at times despite some very few missteps the mandalorian still remains as an exceptional show proving that star wars is in good hands with a very promising future ahead
5,great fit
5,i havent read the books i didnt play the games but i just love it the story is great geralt of rivia is awesome the fighting scenes are mindblowingly good every episode contains so many events i cant wait for season and beyond
5,i have always enjoyed white chili since it doesnt have the acid that is in regular chili my friends here in indiana would always say whats that then i began sharing this recipe one told me all she could do was smile with every bite i agree i just love the creaminess and the just right spices i see why it is contest winning
5,have used a lot of makeup brands and in the past bought their more expensive makeup remover products but none have ever removed mascara eyeshadow foundation bases etc as gently and as well as simple cleansing lotion its consistency is not runny you have to squeeze the bottle appropriately onto the cotton wool which is ideal for controlling how much is dispensed also great for tidying up eyeliner or mascara errors when applied sparsely on a cotton wool bud always keep this now in my bathroom cabinet why pay more
5,i switched off unlimited data for verizon so i wanted to get something thatll store all my mps on my phone easily so when im out and about i dont use my data to stream itthis card was great i put it in my phone went to phone settings to format microsd and connected it to my pc and loaded all my songs to the sd card with plenty of room left over
5,perfect in every way easy to wearvery feminine comfy and goes with everything only problem is color is not like picture it is a mauve not a light pink i still love this top and the color it camre in brighten up with lipstick necklace earrings whatever your pick highly recommend a winner
5,this soup is pretty easy and very delicious i used whole milk since we like our potato soup a little thicker i also heeded the advice of other commenters and left out the celery seed and use celery salt in place of regular salt i think i might just add celery to the veggies next time to up the flavor
5,i made these bars a few days ago and they were a hit i made two batches one with the cherry pie filling and another one with blueberry both turned out beautifully
5,i have a long torso and wider backthick middle in proportion to my narrow tights i was worried after reading other reviewers comments for reference im a in pants in jeans xs in retailer tops but for floreat and maeve im always a i ordered a size and it was perfect with my long torso i expected this dress to fit weird but it was perfection in love i wore it with faryl robin lace up sandals

5,husband asks me to make this recipe again and again
5,so good even my picky eaters loved it
5,this came out fabulous love this recipe both loaves were fluffy and the crust was perfect thank you so much
5,i was hesitant about buying this at first because im busty fcup but i love this top and have received a lot of compliments on it and then i tried it on again at home with leggings and loved it its a great spring time top to wear with leggings and boots
5,it was all going so well but it feels like the writers lost their way after season season onwards just becomes mainly about politics with a really annoying grown lady acting like a spoilt child in the middle of it all i really liked beth in season and some of season however her hate for jamie coupled with her annoying baby voice bad attitude and smutty behaviour just makes her completely unlikeable ive never rooted for the demise of a character so much season is just an absolute mess in terms of continuity with the unnecessary reappearance and disappearance of certain characters just to complete their story arc it feels as if the writers just gave up on certain characters and didnt really know what to do with them season isnt going too well either the remnants of season and are still echoing throughout with again a heavy focus on politics and bethyawn
5,these are my saucy fun jeans when the ps brought them over i wasnt sure about them but at they make the perfect ankle jean they look great with boots and are so comfy i typically wear a but i sized down in these because theyre a lower fit on me and i wanted the waist to be tight as the darling fiance says they make your derriere look great id snag these on sale
5,almost the perfect skirt great colorssuper cute fitvery flatteringgreat lengthvery versatile only issue was size normally a solid i ended up a full sizes smaller very stretchy and comfortablejust try it on first or order a couple of sizes go down at least size as others have saidpilcro strikes againits such a great brand with the most flattering shapes and fabrics
5,absolutely delicious comfort food and well worth the time i added celery to the onion carrot saute and bay leaves to the cream sauce while it simmered but then removed them i used half for a crust pot pie and froze it it cooked up great weeks later the other half of the chicken mix i baked in a qt pirex baker uncovered st for min while i made homemade waffle batter reduced the sugar and typical spices adding a pinch of poultry spice instead my family went wild over the waffles topped with the bubbling and rich hot chicken veggie gravy a total hit and kept the pot pie weeks later seeming like a whole new dish winner winner chicken dinners
5,according to money it is good product
5,im in love with this dress i have seen the chevron pattern of this dress on many women and i can honestly say that i havent seen a body that it doesnt look good on i am a busty girl and was afraid the shape of this dress would make me look as if i was expecting and much to my surprise it didnt at all this is such a great transitional piece to have in your closet i highly recommend it
5,these pants are fun i use them as sleep pants i had to size up because the waist band was a little tight for comfort
5,great value for money light fragrance and leaves clothes soft
5,this is great i used ham precooked
5,pi have made this twice the first time with ground pork and the second time with ground chicken both times it was great i am even thinking about doing chopped up shrimp makes great leftovers i might try taking some sliced and baked won ton wrappers to add to the top for some crunch i sent leftovers with my husband with some chinese mustard for his lunch and he loved itp
5,excellent quick and easy to make
5,the liatris floral top is a comfy sweater knit with floral accents on the front and sleeves the back has a row of buttons though the top easily slips on over ones head it contains wool but is not in the least itchy in fact it has a silky feel to it in its finely knitted fabric it would be cute with a patterned bottom like a plaid or dotted pants as shown doesnt seem to be easy to snag
5,this coat is beautiful i love the color and the design it definitely runs a little large i usually wear a small or a zero and i can wear a small wth a large sweater underneath no problem i might have wanted an extra small but i just stuck with the small because i needed the coat already the vest keeps it warm but the sleeves arent lined so its cold unless you have a nice sweater underneath it if youre going to be in cold weather
5,i made this yesterday and had some today for breakfast first time making bread and it was awesome my wife really enjoyed it too and said dont freeze the nd loaf because it wont last
5,the thing i hate about writing reviews for products like this is that they either work or they dont theres not a lot of user experience to be had if the card is fast enough and doesnt give you readwrite errors then it should get five stars rightfive stars
5,these work great with samsung s and note ipads and iphones got nothing on this those users are amazed when they see all the parts manuals and technical documents and pictures i have at my fingertips i have over gb of documentation and pdfs and pictures all without some cloud that sucks your data especially when traveling out of the country and with gb device memory still more than half free
5,i usually wear a size and i needed a large in this skirt it flows so beautifully
5,this was super and quick we thought that it was full of flavor and so easy
5,love the short in the front long in the back look it has an almost glittery look really roomy i would size down really comfy and pretty
5,ive made this twice now and it is always a hit it has quickly become a family favorite perfect for a potluck
5,sends my son in law straight to sleep the baby takes a little longer i understand
5,this was fantastic i used one pound of ground beef and one pound of spicy italian sausage and added some italian seasoning amp garlic salt to the meat mixture two jars of newmans marinara sauce and two bags of small round cheese raviolis for the first layer of cheese i followed the suggestion of another reviewer and mixed ricotta an egg basil and i added parmesan and mozzarella to the mix i used a x glass pan baked it about minutes then took the foil off and baked it another minutes we had guests for dinner and everyone loved it
5,i got the red it is a great color this is one of those thin soft t shirts it drapes really nicely and dresses up or dresses down the only downside for me is that it takes a little extra effort in the washing department but really not much just have to line dry
5,when i first saw this in the retailer catalog i thought it was beautiful i am a sucker for floral prints and unique color combinations both of which this top has im lbs and a small bust at b i usually wear a size but it was a little loose all around so id say it runs big they had the size at a low sale price in my local store so i bought it without hesitation its a little loose but very flattering and very good quality i definitely recommend it if your shape is s
5,for the grandson bought and the daughtermother is happy i find him great baby opinion unfortunately i do not know but he reacts to him according to his mother
5,this looks just as pictured its comfortable but dressy i love it
5,laptop performance is very good and providing in reasonable price star rating for product sellerindi flash mart also excellent i am giving star rating for them as well
5,my first attempt at this fudge produced very dry and crumbly fudge i changed when i started timing my boil time the second time and the fudge was perfectwhen you time for the minutes do not start timing at a full boil i did this the first time and my fudge was very dry and crumblystart timing for your minutes as soon as it starts to boil i removed from heat after the minutes of boil before i added the marshmallow fluff and peanut butteri only had a oz jar of fluff and measuring out oz was a pain i highly suggest buying the oz jar if possiblegood luck
5,i made this for my daughter soninlaw and grand daughter who is and they absolutely loved it its a keeper recipe for sure i changed a couple of things like i do to every recipe i didnt have cups of shredded cheddar cheesei had an oz block of pepper jack i grated and some pepper velveeta slices about i used i added some thinly sliced celery and or finely chopped garlic cloves with the onions and carrots i had some whipping cream i needed to use so i used about cups percent milk and c whipping cream i used about cups of potatoes because my kids love the potatoes and used about cups of ham served it with some mile high homemade biscuits and they all three pigged out
5,my daughter needed to bring a small batch of cookies to something she had going on at school and shed fallen in love with molasses cookies when she helped her friend bake a batch at the friends house earlier this year my mom never made molasses cookies or gingersnaps much probably because my dad didnt care for them he preferred peanut butter or chocolate chip cookies which i still make for him now that my mom has passed away so i did a search on the toh website and came up with this recipe read the reviews and added a couple of tbsp of chopped crystallized ginger to the dough but otherwise made it exactly as written the cookies turned out fabulously my daughters classmates and teachers hoovered them up and she received three requests for the recipe the cookies are soft but that coating of granulated sugar makes for a nice thin crisp glaze we will definitely be making these again
5,i found this tee to run true to size with a comfortable relaxed fit the neckline and elegant button gives this tee enough detail to dress it up if you wanted to take it in that direction
5,this is just wonderful chili probably is the best description i would describe it as a great comfort soup the flavor is awesome like youre eating a hot liquid chicken and bean burrito sounds weird but thats what it is i accidentally only bought one can of beans not remembering that the recipe called for so i threw in a can of corn to fill it up and it was so great i would do that every time
5,love this top its very simple modern design can go with many different bottoms and the soft pink color gives it a slight distinction from a plain white tank love it
5,this recipe was a great introduction to the asian five spice powder it seems to add so many great flavors that i could never seem to capture

5,i upgraded to this after the price dropped i originally had a gig sandisk card and it was in my mytouch g i found toward my mytouch gs end of life that space is running low so when i got my galaxy s i bought this card it works flawlessly i highly recommend it now errors what so ever super fast transfer rate
5,very good i wish i had this recipe at the beginning of zucchini season will definitely make again three people ate all most the whole dish i let the zucchini set with the salt a good minutes i used some of my homemade salsa and homemade spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce i also topped with some of my pickled hungarian waxed peppers excellent flavor
5,i just bought this shirt last week in stores and i love it it looks different on me i bought an xs though im lbs not typically an xs though im pretty small on top its sleeves on me and tight at my forarms i love it it so cute and you cant see in the picture but the design has a tiny bit of shimmer the detail is cut out but not really see though so i dont feel like i have to wear a tank or anything under it as long as i wear a nude bra did i mention i love it i hope i
5,loved it avoided the flour taste by saute the onions in butter first then add a couple more tbsp of butter and add flour to that to make a roux with onions in it cook it for a few minutes to get rid of the flour taste if its too thick to stir add a bit more butter then proceed to add your liquid sauteed the mushrooms in a separate pot while the onions were cooking yeah dirty pans but avoided the floury taste by cooking the roux
5,this is a solid series henry cavil was phenomenal as geralt perfect casting everything about this is great action actors pacing theyre not shy about showing you monsters either i hate when other shows do that cant wait for season if you want to get the bad taste of the last season of game of thrones out of your mouth watch this

5,this is a good product as a ryzen performance i can do everything that i want this was an very good product for students and office
5,this is adorable lots of compliments on color great fit
5,installed this in my s and it was immediately recognized by the phone i performed a format from the phone just to see what it would do but it didnt give me any further storage capacity with the card with card overhead it still adds nearly gb of storage capacity to my bloated si tested moving existing applications pictures music and other files back and forth between my phone and the card absolutely no problems if youre not going to put a lot of music pictures or applications on your phone youll probably be fine with no additional storage however if youre going to add any storage capacity to your phone why not maximize it with a gb card for about
5,i bought this top in a size im with a longer torso i thought at first that this would be too boxy and cropped but it fits very well and it still covers my stomach when i raise my arms up the material is on the thicker side so its a little more structured which i think gives it a nice look and drape i feel like i could wear this shirt out on a casual day or to work with a blazer over it to dress it up more i highly recommend it especially since the material is linen and cotton whic
5,first of all i usually lay off commenting on other peoples reviews but enough is enough you have people here rating this a and calling it a masterpiece if this is what you consider a masterpiece then i feel sorry for your limited experience and stop try to compare one show with another a review is supposed to be about the show you are reviewing not a comparison i knew nothing about the witcher going in having never read the books nor played the games which i usually consider a bonus since there are no expectations to subvert henry cavill does an excellent job however the writing of the show was just not that great and the special effects were not up to par i binged all episodes and found myself fairly bored during the first episodes and had i rated this show on just those episodes my rating would have been a possible or so the non linear story was interesting if at times confusing but kudos for making something different the pacing however was such that i just wanted them to get on with it already the effects were not well done at all especially the sorry looking dragons and even though i had never read the books or played the games i saw the surprise twist almost immediately watch it if you like but you will probably forget it in a few weeks hopefully season will be better
5,wow ive never cared about characters in a show as much as i already do for these characters in a very long time the pacing is perfect funny tense thrilling action great acting scary moments the show really does have it all and its all done almost to perfection the only kind of annoying thing is that they couldnt figure out why the girl was so important i mean they see the bite she tells them how long ago she got bit and she hasnt turned and they know shes valuable and they need to take her somewhere but they couldnt figure out why it seemed very obvious and the show obviously made it look like they thought about it thats pretty much all thought and that wasnt enough to take it down a point i rarely like new shoes that come out now days but this is one of my favorites of all time so far
5,very good price product
5,excellent love the cream cheese frosting
5,thi was a little different from most crisps ive made so i was a little hesitant but it had good reviews so thought id go ahead and try it it was absolutely fantastic i wont ever make another apple crisp again this is the one my husband could not stop eating it thank you for this one

5,loved this dress it does run a little long even with high heels i am and probably would have been better with a petite size often i do not like the proportions with petite so i ordered the regular size i feel very feminine in this dress and love the opening at the side i can walk in it if i hold the skirt up in front a tiny bit not sure if i will hem it the print is pretty however busy i will keep this dress as it does make one look slim and romantic i added an black belt w
5,i simply loved these cupcakes delicious and very easy the one thing i did to improve them was add tablespoons of grade a maple syrup to the frostings to kick up the fall flavors also to anyone having trouble with to runny frosting your butter or cream cheese was to soft
5,jenna ortega is sensational as wednesday the way she communicates just by using her eyes is amazing to watch the school and universe is beautifully brought to life i think this setting has almost as much potential as hogwarts in harry potter the supporting cast are generally excellent the soundtrack is fantastic if i had to nitpick i would say thing is slightly overused but is likeable being just a hand that is some feat there are satisfying twists and turns and wednesdays personality is both hilarious and gripping i hope this runs for multiple seasons and we get to see more of the family in their home
5,what more can be said its a great card with plenty of storage space to handle or expand your tablet camera or video cameras needs with the included sd card adapter the micro card can be read in any sd card readerwriter it is initially formatted in some format that my windows pro ms surface pro could read or see but from another laptop using the sd adapter i was able to reformat it and make it usable for the surface progreat card for a great price

5,awesome meet the expectations
5,i bought this in black last year and i love it i also like the two prints offered here but unfortunately the matching tops arent really my style and these prints wouldnt be so easy to mix and match please offer in other solid colors i would buy all of them this skirt is really that fabulous not only does it fit well and run true to size it also comes up a bit further than other swim skirts i have tried on and gives a little more tummy coverage but not too much somehow it hits me a

5,memory card works fine no problems i have a number of sandisk memory cards and ive never had any problems with them
5,to the critic who applauds reillys performance but finds the character beth vile and disgusting i suggest that a female antihero with sass is exactly the portrayal that shines in this excellent production beth is unforgiving and her fathers daughter which adds much to the show oh she kelly reilly is also very sexy
5,my nephew loves this
5,loved it very easy to make light amp fluffy
5,best fudge recipe very fluffy and creamy we only make at christmas and my husband helps with the stirring yields great results

5,excellent flavor and really easy i was able to substitute greek yogurt for the buttermilk and my cupcakes were great and perfectly moist i was also able to do it without an electric mixer so thats a plus
5,good performance if you
5,i ordered an extra small it fits with both a humble tee and a button down with the sleeves rolled up ive tried it with jeans and also joggers and heels really a cute and versatile sweater i got the olive but can see where the black might be more universally useful this one works perfectly for me however
5,very easy to make the taste is light and great for spring potlucks best of all you can indulge without added calories excellent and delicious
5,these cookies are great i reduced the amount of sugar to cup and put in cranberries instead of chocolate chips they dont last long inour house
5,the lightweight knit and flattering colors made this top so perfect for me that i bought it for full price its big so id size down youll still get a forgiving shape flattering colors and just a really nice option for work or off hours
5,really it is nice compact laptop along with numbered keys big display so that to conveniently to work battery backup is good enough back light keyboard is missing hence it is enough for family purpose and small office work
5,this soup was delicious i only used lb of hamburger but that was plenty for us i did have a lot leftover so next time ill add the rice to each bowl and not to the entire pan of soup it soaked it up and was no longer soup the next day it was easy enough to thin out with more stock but the rice got a little mushy still good and none went to waste
5,i bought this nightgown to wear as a winter maternity dress it really fit the bill the knit fabric stretched nicely as i grew but was still flattering before i got larger as well there is no way i would actually sleep in this dress it would be way too hot it is cute with calf length boots and i look forward to rocking it without the belly next winter i would normally wear a petite length and bought the medium and though it was longer the length was not awkward and kept it from being to
5,saving this one my moto is everything is better with bacon and cheddar definitely not a fan of velveeta so i will be switching the cheese out and using fresh celery rather than the celery seed because that has a tendency to be overpowering even with a tsp but everything else will remain the same we love fresh hot soups in the winter months and i am always looking for something different than the usual suspects
5,i tried on about items in the store today and didnt buy anything but if i had bought just one thing it would have been this great floral tshirt i may have to go back for it the combination of the very soft material and faded look of the pattern gives it the look and feel of an old favorite tee shirt the fit is exceptional as well not too loose or too snug i would definitely snap it up on sale and may even have to cave to the full price
5,incredibly soft and comfortable not as fitted as i would like this often happens to me with skinny pants though i want to wear these guys everyday
5,i made this cake and it was such a big hit i have had to make it several times over for friends this is the best chocolate cake i have had it is so moist and good that beware it will get you into trouble my boss says this is the best chocolate cake she has ever tasted as well thanks for sharing

5,i thought mr cavil was well cast here very believable very physical and this role demands that in fact there should be more gerald and less secondary charchters yennifer was the weak point for me but im hoping the last episodes things slowly improve good popcorn evening show im sticking with it
5,until season it was a realy good show but season what the f happened adrien brody with the worst italian accent ever full of cliché so so naive and so so disappointing

5,i was hesitant to buy this but im so glad i did this is a beautiful poncho i am petite and usually ponchos overwhelm me but this fits just right it is extremely soft not itchy at all the color along the bottom of the poncho is actually a bright pink color it looks a little more red in the photo to me im still happy with this it will be a wonderful addition to my fallwinter wardrobe great product
5,works as expected love the great price and use it with my gopro i would definitely recommend this to everyone
5,this top is great to wear under a blazer when cool or alone on a warm day i rated it as runs small only because if you are a little busty as i am it is a little snug across the chest otherwise fits great
5,loved the frosting i made the cake in a bundt pan and it looked beautiful moist with good albeit somewhat mild flavor easy to make and frost lots of requests for the recipe
5,works nicely and good noise level control
5,best laptop nice design very fast booting

5,i suffer from dry sensitive skin and vaseline products are one of very few moisturizers i can use without my skin reacting by flaring up or itching terriblythe first thing i noticed was the beautiful fresh aroma as soon as i clipped open the lidas soon as i applied a drop onto my skin i instantly felt a soothing sensation and didnt feel greasy unlike many moisturizers and absorbed quickly but effectively as my skin quickly felt moisturised and hydrated this product has helped my dry skin problem massively i use it every day particularly after showering or bath and also before bed with the confidence my skin will still be feeling freshly moisturised come the morning fantastic product and definatly a recommendation from me this review was collected as part of a promotion
5,it taste so good
5,i wish there were hundreds of episodes to watch over and over nothing comes close to it in pure enjoyment in an era where almost every show is written for feminists or beta males finally a show real men can thoroughly enjoy
5,great cupcakes i cut the frosting in half as suggested by other users but ran out with cupcakes left i decorated the cupcakes exactly as pictured i would suggest making a full batch of the frosting and freezing any leftovers for future baking projects it is delicious

5,have to disagree with previous posters i found just one of these on the sale rack in my local retailer someone returned it from online and it was adorable on got many compliments in the dressing room area other customers asked if there were more available but its turns out its an online exclusive it does have a zipper i recommend sizing up not because it runs small i think its pretty true to size but i think it looks better a bit loosedrapery fabric is soft and pretty tailoring is f
5,i dont have too much to say about an sd card but i wanted to at least give it the stars it deserves we used it in a galaxy s and it has worked flawlessly so far i havent run any benchmarks to confirm the speed etc but it does not seem to hinder the phone or camera which we now have saving photosvideos to the sd card in any wayi will point out the the s camera app did notify us that burst mode shots will still write to the phones internal memory potentially due to the high date of data being written thats good to know if you use burst mode a lot and were hoping to use an sd card for that purpose
5,these pants are very very cute and high quality they can be worn with a variety of colors and can be dressed up or down they are also very flattering i definitely recommend sizing up as they run small my normal size was a tad tight in the waist and there is very little stretch but the next size up was perfect
5,this is sooo yummy i cut the bacon and the onion into smaller pieces to make it easier to eat but otherwise did exactly as described and was very happy with this will certainly be making this again
5,love love love this dress the fit is amazing and is slimming although the lace is delicate looking it wears well
5,my ipod finally bit the dust so i bought this card to use in my galaxy so i could use it as my new music player it was very easy to transfer the music and get it playing right away i cant complain at all it was nice to be able to expand my storage on my phone enough with this that i didnt have to go buy another ipod i have a lot of music and this thing holds it all and doesnt slow my phone down at all no complaints here i actually bought another one of these for my galaxy tab so i can keep all my music on that too so its safe to say i would buy it again

5,i havent owned a denim jacket since college but i felt inspired this season this pilcro jacket is perfect a little distressed along the edges tailored fit and i love the cozy collar looks expensive fits really well
5,this is larger than i need but on a long vacation i did not want to start deleting photos or videos to make room for others so this was way more than i needed for several hundred large photos and lots of to second videos as well with lots of memory left over actually a gb would have been enough the card worked well and im happy with my purchase
5,great dress the seaming helps add shape to the dress it is flattering and super comfortable this dress is so easy to wear im sure i will reach for it again and again
5,i love to bake so ive tried many different basic bread recipes all of the ones ive made turn out too gooey on the inside not thoroughly cooked or too hard and crunchy additionally there are so many ingredients and it takes forever to make a loaf of bread this bread is the best bread ive ever had in my life it is such an easy recipe with only ingredients and it takes minutes to whip up aside from rising baking time the flavor is wonderful and the smell of baking bread fills the house for this recipe amazing
5,i was surprised how soft and comfy the fabric is on this top when i tried it on i didnt want to take it off its a little bigger than i would like i got a small and am usually between xs and s may have sized down if the top were availablebut the fit and cut are flattering
5,super easy and turns out great every time
5,simply outstanding ive made this recipe more than once several times at high elevation in denver another time atnear sea level in houston i never leave reviews for recipes but felt the need to pay it forward on this one pro tip based on experience and experimentation use unbleached bread flour if you want a softer crust ive used standard allpurpose bleached flour but the crust ends up too hard its almost too difficult to cut through it in the end i much prefer the softer crust as for the rest of the recipe follow it its perfect i mix it all by hand using a mixing bowl and literally a regular fork yes my arm begins to ache by the time ive added the th cup of flour also if you are a breadbaking newbie like i was i used advice found online to determine if my bread had risen enough on both the st and nd rise
5,ive tried a wide variety of corn pudding recipes and this is the best ive found made it at thanksgiving and everyone loved it this will now be my goto recipe

5,made this recipe for my mom for mothers day actually the first meal ive cooked for her in my new home yay my whole family had seconds i forgot the sour cream yeah thats what i get for trying to do too many things at once but it still turned out delicious i might add a little more liquid next time though as i thought it was a little thick although maybe the sour cream might have helped that definitely making again

5,i originally bought the white lace version of this dress but it felt too bridey then i snagged all three of the velvet blazers and spotted this black version i like that it is not all lace with the pleated chiffon center the under slip is straight and fits with the outer layer sheer enough to give the appearance of there being a shape under the flow it is so versatile as i can do it with the velvet blazers and booties or classic lbd with black pumps well worth the price as this will f

5,les fauves is another version of last years larkhill swing dress but better one the swing has less to swing but in a good way they reduced the voluminous amount of material while retaining the fun swing aspect two the dress is shorter so its more flattering to the vertically challenged like me whats the same still wonderful silk discreet pockets beautiful abstract floral print and those horrid little buttons that are difficult to fasten on the back of a tight neckband collar i h

5,i paired this beauty with the beacheress necklace and the result was stunning the colorway in this top just makes my summer tan pop i am b lbs and the xs fit perfectly since it does run short there is no way that i would suggest anyone go with a petite unless they are under andor very short waisted the fabric in the top drapes beautifully and i felt super feminine all eveningand got tons of compliments as well

5,the drama series was well created i am a not a huge fan of the addams storyline but i have watched the animated movie the addams family though i did not enjoy much of the story i just neglected it i thought the same thing would occur to this series but this was way over my expectations the curiosity build until the very end was great the acting of the cast especially of the main character was admirable the elements and the horror that was presented was great and had a good perspective the should be gore elements have been replaced by viewable horror elements overall it fulfilled my expectations and removed the misconception on the addams story i really enjoyed it and would gladly wait for a sequel season if one is produced
5,love this medium weight wool cape it is so much prettier in person the photos look a bit boring but this cape is very versatile and simple to wear some capes hang oddly on me but this one was flattering without the bulk not itchy either the photos dont really show the sleeves clearly but there is a sleeve built into the cape the taupe color is a rich neutral that can be paired with thin or thicker turtlenecks or shirts the sleeves are bracelet length so full length sweaters will show und
5,laptop performance is top
5,my family just loves this soup yummmm
5,i tried not to have any expectations for this show and rather be prepared for it to be a disappointment now having watched episodes and some of them two times im happy to say that this has been by far one of the most enjoyable shows ive seen in years i have a soft spot for zombie horror and postapocalyptic stuff but most of the shows about zombie apocalypse trip on the exact same clichés with the focus quickly moving away from the zombies and to the survivors and their relationships interactions many good shows have turned into soaps with the actual horror element barely involved of course the last of us also includes stories about people interactions and relationships as it would be hard to relate to the characters if theyd be just these onedimensional faces however maybe it is because of the adaptation from a video game the last of us doesnt drag on these matters too much outside from the few main characters and that is so refreshing i also wasnt a fan of casting pedro pascal as joel but i gotta admit hes doing great job bella ramsey as ellie is phenomenal the only reason im not giving this a is because the show is yet unfinished
5,little dry added pasta waterhusband loves it
5,the greatest thing we have ever boughtmy baby months and i sleep so well with the beautiful music very relaxing and very nice slumbersi only hope he lasts very long and doesnt break so fastthe heartbeat and the breathing movements are also good so far the money has always been worth it

5,good laptopbut microsoft word excel ect its paid software
5,this is the most valuable laptop in this price segment and asus is one the most trusted brands it has a w charger which really charges up the laptop very fast its display quality is very good in this segment i will suggest everyone to buy this laptop in this price range
5,this is a true retailer dress cute and quirky kudos for the builtin liner with scalloped hem very pretty and pockets i like the colorful yet subtle embroidered ice cream sticks on the dress and the white background makes the colors and details really pop pun intended i echo the previous reviewers that the bust is very small i usually wear size regular in this brand im b waist hips im and the bottom hem falls right at the upper knees but when i tried on size
5,its gb what more needs to be said i stuck it in my surface pro as additional storage space and it does just that no problems

5,i am a huge tim burton fan and addams family fan and this show did not disappoint i have counted down the days until its released and then binged it twice in less then a week jenna ortega was a masterful wednesday and i cant wait to see more she took a one liner character and turned her into this intriguing teenage girl who was relatable while still being wednesday i loved how she was able to be true to who wednesday addams is but show character growth and her own bit of emotion time burton took a world we all know and love and made it more current and relatable he did his usual magic on the screen and i loved it the cast was perfect and the storyline kept you guessing i will be waiting impatiently to hear season two news
5,looks great it is more off whitetan then white though
5,i love this pajama combo it is super cute and comfortable
5,only for students and online classes
5,just made this tonight and my husband and i both thought it was so good i added some garlic powder and ground pepper to the chicken while sauteing for some extra flavor and left off the green onions very tender and flavorful great for a week night meal but would also be nice for guests definitely a keeper
5,just like the book they took it and made it the screenplay a really good show and funny to like the books i hope they continue with so many great reads to choose from maybe the european chapter with the cold war era story line enjoy

5,just wanted to say that there should be an award for thing as he is just as vital to the show as all the other supporting players and emma is imho a real star as she plays far too well a character with far more dimensions than wednesday emma aka enid is able to bring out the real wednesday character thing without voice and just a few fingers is able to express human emotions and communication that we can all learn from sometimes saying fewer words can often express more and having to write six hundred works for a review seems to be a little much i only wish i had more to say as i prefer fewer
5,this show had high expectations from me when i first saw the trailers but man it is on another level a truly good show that doesnt care about making money or views and offers a beautiful masterpiece with excellent production value it feels like a high budget film at times it does get a bit slow at times but that is very far between really good episodes musiccharacters visuals acting are all so good and made my appreciate the work put into this as a fan of the franchise and of good television i cant recommend this enough a very good star wars show that pays a lot of respect to the franchise and with that finale solidifies itself as the best thing to come out of disney star wars by fareven the mandalorian
5,good for students
5,great product really enjoying since its arrival thank you asus
5,this is a christmas brunch dish which is always on my menudelicious it is super simple to assemble the night before and just pop in the oven to bake on christmas morning my six sons and their dad all love it
5,saw the grey one on the table at my local retailer first thing i did was touch it to feel if its soft and it felt like butta surprisingly its a very snuggly and warm sweater despite it not being very thick i think the grey is conservative enough for the office and it goes with pretty much everything yet the geometric shapes make it modern and interesting looking i hate turtleneck choke and big cowl neck reminds me of the s but this is a compromise of both which is a bonus since i
5,super comfortable great with jeans or leggings i would definitely order a size down
5,this yellowmango color is so beautiful in person i actually dont have the best skin tone for shades of yellow but i couldnt resist trying this one on it turned out to be perfect the silhouette is very feminine especially around the neckline shoulders there is a lot of fabric but i actually appreciate that the dress is substantive finally the nicest thing is that the dress can easily be dressed up or dressed down depending on how you accessorize it looking forward to summer
5,honestly it is a banger for this price segment and could easily beat the nitro and asus f design is sleek and display is the best you can get
5,processor is good i p series which is considered a good tradeoff as h series processor produce a lot of heat and thus reduce the life of the device dropped the plan for hp pavilion plus as oled panels are developing defects after sometime of blue dots as read online from the reviews of the users can go for this product if you are getting under k definitely display settings can be tweaked and shouldnt be much of issue
5,i cannot say how much i love this dress i purchased it in midnovember and im wearing it for the th time this evening which prompted me to write a review it fits tts the stomach area is slightly unforgiving but due to the dark color its not at all a deal breaker plus its a great dress to wear with opaque tights which solve the tummy issues as well what i love most about this dress is its ability to go from day to nightless formal to more formal it looks great with edgy black ankl

5,very suitable for sleeping aid

5,i cant wait for it to get colder so i can wear this out love the ochre color paired with the maroon faux fur lapel i especially love the detail at the pocket edges very well made the faux fur is luxuriously soft and removable this will go great with denim and long skirts the wool is a bit stiff in my opinion but thats okay this will make a great addition to your autumn and winter closet most of my outerwear are blacks or dark blues or dark greys so its nice to be able to wear a bit of
5,my family loved this recipe prepared it ahead of time and refrigerated for cooking later that evening i had never made bruschetta before but it was not difficult and it tasted delicious definitely will make again

5,this is very good for students and also good for light work
5,two episodes in and im really enjoying season three so far a lot of believable or even unbelievable interesting characters and dialogue of light and dark shades and undertones of delevoping storytelling so far so good the pace and the weaving inbetween the holidays makers moves correctly and is becoming intriguing i also like the side story of the young thai could be couple i liked the first season of white lotus but didnt like the second season update for anyone interested okay update five episodes in and its losing my enthusiasm too much emphasis on just sex not enough on the story the season has become a bit meandering maybe something big will happen in the next few episodes but its a long time to wait its lost its initial intrigue too much about sex
5,love this dress i tried it on at the store and loved how it felt on i put it on hold to think about it and returned later that day to purchase i am glad i did the st day i wore it i received numerous compliments
5,the orange version is very nice bright but not tacky the fit is super flattering and i love the crisscrossed hem the top part is also flattering on the shoulders halter but need a strapless bra the fit me well no need for petite on that one might be too short for me dd in waist lbs pattern is also gorgeous recommend

5,i purchased these jeans in my regular size they are a slouchy slim leg that looks adorable with flats or heels i could have sized down but wanted the slouchy look they are very stretchy and soft have worn a few times and they retained thier shape
5,i really love creamy mayo based cole slaw this one has a great mix of sweet and sour although a bit of vinegar might add a little acid to accentuate the flavor i made it for guests and they all loved it
5,this card transfers data incredibly quickly one can notice the difference between a regular sandisk memory card and this ultra version great memory and it was at a price i loved using it for my microsoft surface pro and no problems with it
5,i bought the one with blue and white top and black bottom absolutely loved it i am so the dress is part is a bit long for meended up wearing my inch heels to make it fit the fabric is more heavy than what it seems in the pictures but that makes it more formal its great

5,these photos do not do the vest any justice i randomly saw this in the sale section at my local retailer tried it on and it was super cute but i did the whole walk away maybe youll forget about it thing that did not happen i ran back to retailer on my lunch break the next day and thank goodness there was still one left in my size it actually drapes in a flattering way and it looks polished its so versatile i would not have looked for this vest based on these photos but im telling y
5,today almost for any medium quality teddy we pay what is worth this teddy that even more the touch of the skin is very soft it is seen that they have taken into account that it is for babies because you do not expect me neither the seams that simulate the eyes neither the mouth nor the nose you have certain parts in cloth how they can be the soles of the feet to the bottom of the tail but the seams are well done that is not appreciated the sound is a tone that does not turn out strident there is a feeling of relaxation besides the dim light that comes out of the navel does the times of light for fear of the darkness we have tried it with a baby that is barely months old when you put your brother and one of teddyney next has been curious when we have activated it we have not noticed any kind of fear and soon they were both lying next to each other the truth is that seeing the result is worth the price that is worth it
5,i make this often i sometimes use broccoli its yummy too
5,this was amazing made it for easter today and loved it i cut down on sugar for both the custard filling and the topping and its perfect will definitely make this again
5,i use this recipe as a template as an experienced baker i can make numerous modifications with a recipe this basic to answer some other concerns it is helpful to start with the yeast and two cups of flour and add the liquid ingredients before you add salt and let sit about ten minutes this fully activated the yeast and can improve results to the person whose bread came out doughy have you confirmed your oven temperature is accurate often home ranges can vary in actual temperature
5,i love this top i debated between an xs and a s but im usually an xs in deletta so thats what i got it fits perfectly and is beautiful

5,delicious easy to prepare great to take to potlucks
5,love this great way to use up a jar of pizza sauce too come summer everyone has zucchinis everything is in this meal tooa filling side dish or a complete meal made it in ramekinsa good way to serve it toospray the ramekins thosausage substitute works as wellbiggest deal is getting all the water out of the zucchini
5,having read all lee childs jack reacher books i would say these series are very close in many ways to the sourse however theres one major flaw a complete miscast for the neagley character shes supposed to be small and beatiful instead we have an ugly manlike version played by maria sten who pretty much cant act i thought okay next season should be better since hopefully no neagley there as she appears in only couple of novels but no they actually are planning to extend her character into next season bummer the whole jack reacher charisma is based a lot on his loneliness him being a oneman army and not needing anyone to achieve the goals he sets for himself there certainly is no need to team him up all the time with someone especially like sten character theres zero chemistry there too im afraid next season will kill the series with a good potential by driving it too far away from the original book series also in lee childs books there pretty much are no obscenities why do we need them in the show suddenly what goal does the foul language achieve
5,warning its totally sheer so you will need to wear a tank under it or unless youre very confident in your midsection you can wear a bandeau or just a bra its definitely a lounge leisure wear piece and great for layering if you want to wear it out its lightweight and perfect layer over a simple dress or top i live in this over the weekends i am a larger gal broader shoulder and purchased an xl its true to size and roomy
5,very yummy my husband amp my parents really loved it and my dad is very picky nowadays i used pounds of meatloaf mix meat instead of only ground beef cause beef is just so expensive and it was wonderful i also kicked up the spices a little with montreal steak seasoning when browning meat and a little crushed red pepper so good and those of us who wanted added a little texas pete to soup when we ate with grilled cheeses had plenty to freeze too even better reheated will be making a lot
5,very good productit served my purpose i could use ms office online version for free on it very feasible to carry good keyboard display quality and the very user friendly osi could not use qbasic and logo in it except this everything else is perfect i am a computer science faculty for a reputed school
5,this show is the reminiscent of my childhood as i grew up watching the version of the addams family and the tv series even though the series focuses on wednesday addams and her adolescent problems such as her fight not to be like her mother love affairs etc and her life among the other outcasts it still has the feeling of the old show with all the interesting family members to be honest i wish we couldve seen a little bit more of the other family members but thats not a big deal as the series called wednesday i want to underline another point before coming to the flawless performance by jenna ortega which is the lack of representation of some outcast members i havent understood the the purpose of other outcast members than enid bianca eugene and xavier its understandable as nevermore is a huge school with many outcasts but i would like to see at least more of yoko as she seems to be written to be an important character but we could see not many scenes including her hopefully well see more from other outcasts next season now lets come to the point of jennas performance which instantly increases my rating by one point im not unfamiliar with her performance as ive watched her on the fallout stuck in the middle x and scream but i was still shocked when i watched episode of wednesday ive watched lots of movies and series this year but her performance as wednesday has impressed me the most its no shocker as she had given lots and lots of efforts to portray the character before the shooting started learning cello fencing archery and german i dont even need to mention the dancing scene its pleasing to see she finally gets the attention shes already deserved from the fans and critics i know itd be a long review as im unable to shorten my ideas as a nonnative speaker so i added a pros cons section for ease to read cons lack of relationship with family members and representation of them lack of representation of characters other than major characters and some minor ones some cgi are a little bit cartoonish script could be little bit darker and gory which would make the series more tim burtonesque as the shows rated pros jenna ortega shes just flawless i couldnt think of any other cast for the role after christina riccis performance emma myers shes so cool funny and colorful enid is perfect other half to complete wednesdays ying with her yang thing christina ricci all other cast yes including luis guzman as opposed to the most of the comments saying hes not the right choice i loved his gomez and he looks like the gomez from comic strips directing is really solid especially the first episodes p s i still wanna see an addams family story directed andor produced by tim burton maybe after that he would give it a shot
5,much nicer in person the chunky knit reads more gray with black accents than blue as described here there are lovely flecks of rust blue goldenrod green throughout super soft stretchy its fine sizing downotherwise the arm holes dip down very low im usually a size small and xs was best for me bust long torso broad shoulders i can see wearing another layer underneath when cold weather sets in

5,im new to bread making ive tried two other breads before this one and this one is my favorite my family enjoys this bread and its very easy to make i did not use a bread pan and my loaves baked nicely it does not state whether to preheat the oven or not i preheated it i will not buy store bought bread again unless i am in a pinch great recipe

5,this is a great piece to add to your wardrobe the flowy and light feel of the fabric is great i got the pink which surprised me because i wear so much black the length fits longer than most rompers which is great it makes it a classic fit i definitely recommend this and suggest trying a size up the waist has elastic but its snug
5,i took a leap and ordered this top in both colors my style is bohemian and flowy so i knew this fit the bill i purposely bought these blouses because i read the reviews and being a h i knew i needed then to run on the larger side i love both colorways equally but that said the blue and yellow pattern runs a whole size smaller than the brown patterned blouse the fit and fabric even feel different the blue and yellow is thicker and less flowy and fits exactly to my body instead of bei
5,at k after applying my hdfc credit card this laptop is just an awesome machine i love the sleek slim design its one of the lightest laptops available on the internet it feels like a tablet in my hand the form factor of this laptop is just wow a great product with capable performance and useful features the battery could be better but its still moderate considering the powerful chipset
5,i needed some new sd cards for my new tablets after researching i bought the sandisk ultra gb microsdhc class it is way better than the almost same price sandisk ultra without class the ultra class is lightning fast you can see the difference when you copy large files you will note that read and write procedures are much faster whether you use it in camera smart phone or tablet the price is also ok only drawback i noted was that the recognized capacity is not gb but gb in my asus memo pad other than that i am extremly pleased with this micro sd
5,really a nice product excellent quality and well working my little one likes it very much

5,my personal rating in my opinion its not as good as most of witcher fanboys here claims to be and before some people downvote this and ignores my review i want to let you know that i am a genuine witcher fan as well i have read all the books played all the games im just expressing my opinion about the show and here it is one of the main things that i have noticed from watching the first single episode that frustrates me is like just how rushed and disappointing the lesser evil short story is that i didnt even had time to develop to the characters at all which kind of ruined the immersion for me and also the way that it felt that they just really rushed through the other short stories in later episodes especially the edge of the world where it literally felt so bad and very far from when i have read the same story from the books and they seemed to have continued this trend to other short stories as well where they changed the approach plots points from the short stories but with almost the same conclusion except for question of price edge of the world where in my opinion they got butchered and ruined for me they pretty much deviated from the source books as much as they can and decided to wrote their own story that simply doesnt work as well as the books especially with the writers with their amateur writing quality and the very fast pacing with constant jump cuts every minutes that somehow ruins this show now to the positive things that i have liked from the show the fighting choreography was flashy but looked really good talking about the one on the lesser evil not the bounds of reason with cringy aard kiss acting performance of myanna buring as tissaia and freya allan as ciri and jodhi may as calanthe really stands out as well henry cavill as geralt looked really good too pros fighting choreography was really good especially on the the lesser evil episode acting performance of some characters was decent especially tissaia calanthe ciri cons writing quality is very mediocre and isnt as good as the books many unnecessary changes from the books source plot points very rushed short stories that felt very bland and wasnt able to capture the soul of the books pacing being way too fast and very confusing especially for non book readers nilfgaardian armor looking absolutely terrible brokilon plots being completely pointless mainly caused by the unnecessary changes on the original plot from the books rating on each aspect story writing cinematography fighting choreography atmosphere soundtrack acting dialogue in my opinion the writing of the changed approach plot points just didnt felt really as good as the books but despite all those complaints still in the end even with my reasonable skeptical expectation i have still enjoyed it a bit and i was interested to continue watching through it and im interested enough to season i give it overall it was not bad but its definitely not amazing either like most witcher fans claims to be and as a book adaptation they obviously didnt kept their promise of being faithful to the books at all like most people have claimed when some people criticize the show of being inaccurate

5,this is a really great recipe especially for beginners the ingredients are really simple and the directions are easy to follow they came out great c of sugar made it super sweet so ill put in less next timei didnt have baking soda at the time so i used tsp of baking powder as others suggested
5,i bought these on sale for a great price online without seeing in person and was pleased to find that they are very versatile could be very casual or great for weekend shopping etc the purple is a great shade and the fit is great im pound for reference and i purchased the size
5,i didnt see any trailers or reviews about this show it was relatled to the addams family and that was enough for me since i am a big fan and had seen them all what im trying to say is i started to see wednesday blindly without any expectations or whatsoever and god i am happy i did that when i started the first episodes i was really impressed the casting is absolutely amazing and the gory addams atmosphere was totally there thats was surprising to me until i saw that the director is the brilliant tim burton who of course master this gory grey atmosphere likewise nightmare before christmas corpse bride and others you can see burtons fingerprints all over the show wednesday is really fits to the role plot is solid and very entertaining the show get you hooked since the st episodes soundtracks are excellent chopinmetallica nothing else matters also using edgar allah poe in the plot was a great a nice touch and kinda a tribute to this brilliant authorpoet overall this is excellent work and i watch all episodes in one night kudos for the actors actresses writers and everyone who shared in this amazing piece of art its a solid

5,under k very good product im so glad i bought this
5,battery performance avarage design and looks is good
5,acting is great i love the pace of the first episode and story line is good but just a bit predictable with the whole immunity thing i was hoping for a more exciting secret but hey i dont know anything about the game so maybe there is something more to that year old second episode felt a bit dragged out and just like a mediacore episode of the walking dead not even close to some of twds best episodes its nice to have a well made show that will probably keep my attention for a while but im very surprised this has a rating of a is near perfection a is masterpiece level this is just a good show nothing more ill change my rating if the show has more to offer later update just watched the third episode and it seems that each episode gets more boring and less intriguing the romance in the rd episode could have been done better they spent too much time on it therefore making the episode boring in my opinion while rushed at the same time and i really cant tell if the romance had anything to really add to the overall plot just seemed like a filler episode my big problem with this episode is that it deviated so much from the other episodes its a show about zombies so this isnt really the time or place to dedicate an entire episode to romance i love romance but not when im watching a zombie show if there is romance in a zombie show it should be done subtlety without making the show lose momentum this show is starting to become mediocare at best
5,my husband who usually doesnt like meatballs went back for seconds with these they are great
5,i didnt have the beans so i made it without amp it was more like a soup it was delicious i will definitely make this again and again and again

5,i use this in my android phone pretty much for mps to play in my truck it certainly doesnt perform like a class card when writing the files to it but not for me wasnt that important
5,to start with i should point out that i was pretty indifferent to the character cassian andor before watching this series so wasnt particularly excited about him getting his own series much unlike obiwan kenobi and ahsoka maybe because of that i found the first couple of episodes pretty slow and it just didnt have me hooked however to say that im glad i went back to it and then stuck with it would be an understatement there are some great characters in this show and some brilliant if despicable ideas and when they put the whole picture together it was fantastic i didnt like all of it there were definitely a few things i would have liked to have seen done differently but for the most part it was really enjoyable and im looking forward to rewatching it also fiona shaw was in it and was great so thats always a win if you find the start a little slow hang on in there its well worth it
5,been waiting to buy a macbook since m lunch but finally bought air m because of bbd in flipkart i got it at an unbelievable price but i was a little disappointed with the delivery as it got delivered after days after it came out for delivery i think i dont need to talk anything about macbook air m performance its literally awesome and no window laptop can beat its battery

5,this dress is to die for its exactly as pictured beautiful quality and extremely flattering all the lace and lining make it a slightly heavier dress i can imagine it getting really warm after a while in the summer sun but it would absolutely be worth the bit of sweat to wear this gorgeous dress
5,this top is cute love the ruffle sleeves the store i got these had both colors so ended getting both colors because the top is cute does run a little large i ended up going a size down
5,i was so close to rating this a the show is close to perfection the feel the story the execution feels like classic star wars and blows away the new episodes disney has released under the new trilogy its time for disney to give jon favreau his own trilogy

5,i bought the navy polka dot top and i love the way the design lets you work orange into your wardrobe if its a color you wouldnt normally wear the blouse is sheer so a camisole is needed underneath im looking forward to layering over the blouse in the fall to add a pop of pattern to a navy sweater im a f and size fit me easily with extra room under the arms the gathering stops above the bust so that it fits snug above and loose below worn loose the blouse is fairly long coverin

5,i have a lowend android phone and this made using it that much easier because of increased responsiveness and of course storage capacity
5,the storyline is intense and very well writtenthe acting is good however they use the bible for evil which is very disturbing they add stuff in there like theyre quoting scripture but they arent making the bible seem harsh and cruel omitting all of the love and grace which is of the new testement what the characters are doing is not christian in the least not in the true sense making it look cold and twisted and cultish otherwise great storyline
5,made this for wifes church bake sale several years ago and theyve begged for another every subsequent year it has always cracked in the past so this year i baked at f for minutes with a pan of water in the oven then turned off the oven and left it in oven with door cracked for more minutes no cracks in cake also helpful to know c graham cramer crumbs is crackers c oreo crumbs is oreo cookies

5,one of the things i love most about this dress is that the straps are adjustable you can tie them as loose or tight as you like like other reviewers mentioned the color of this dress is vibrant and the fringe at the bottom is the perfect detail retailer is famous for doing i am lbs and lately all of the dresses i have been buying at retailer have been xsp i have never worn petites before so i dont know if retailer is just making their dresses a little bigger but i definitely have neede
5,excellent product arrived at the merc house it is a wonderful otter of fisherprice well made and soft it has no external seams for the safety of our puppy and has the tummy that moves and that lights up crushing the tummy in fact will emit a few seconds of relaxing music for the child this is more a function that will use the baby because if we go to open it from the back we have many combinations to make the first is the adjustment of the sound level the second is the choice of the ringtone being of so many white noises that reconcile the sleep including the heartbeat the third is the onoff of the light on the tummy while the last function provides only the light without audio the back is velcro and does not have buttons or seams and the batteries inserted are protected by a screw drawer just for the maximum safety for the child
5,this tee is so cute and well constructed its not a fabric thats going to wrinkle and pill eventually which i love it runs tts and i like that its thin but not to sheer that i need a camisole just a nude bra
5,this top is exactly as pictured and the fit is perfect the knit is a nice quality and the embroidery is striking i cant wait to wear it it will look great with skinny jeans
5,i dont think its possible to say enough good things about this dress the fit is beautiful im lbs and am a h the material is soft and swishes around your legs in a delightful way and the length has all the positives of a maxi dress without dragging on the ground it doesnt show bra straps it looks good with either heels or a trusty pair of birkenstocks the pattern is fun essentially its the perfect summer dress
5,mind blowing laptop in this price range
5,my all time favourite softener iuve never smelt anything so nice and lasts for a long time very happy customer
5,this skirt is absolutely beautiful and is a gorgeous vintage red which is more pigmented than im used to in my closet but thats not necessarily a good thing or a bad thing it runs a little large in the waist also the skirt comes up higher on the torso than pictured mine comes up to slightly above my waistline and ends at about mid thigh however i love this skirt and its timeless design assures me it will stay in my wardrobe for years to come
5,i have read every lee child novel and short story on jack reacher at least times i love the books then i watched the new series reacher based on the killing floor his first reacher novel i ended up watching all episodes times over week im retired and have the time today i read many of the comments from people who reviewed reacher i was shocked that there were several reviews of or out of i thought this series was better than the cruise movies and gave it an i thought ritchson was excellent as reacher i really like the roscoe character i enjoyed the finlay character and his negative outlook as it gave a little balance to the cast i was very happy to see frances neagley being brought into the series too she was such a bad ass in the books and was in this series too loved the fight sequences i think with time they will bring more big guys to challenge reacher going forward which will just make it better the part series stuck pretty close to the book and that seems rare in hollywood i hope that continues i know that only reacher and neagley will continue on in the next series and i am really looking forward to season
5,it may have started off slowly but week after week it built a complex story of war struggle triumph pain love and defeat its hard to put into words what this show has done but i feel like there is hope again that we can continue to experience the universe first created by george lucas the cast is excellent the writing is spectacular the sets and visuals are immerive the scorepowerful and the directing is some of the best ive seen either on tv or film i cant wait to see the second season im onboard for this ride to the end we are the star wars generation and we have grown up this series is made for us
5,beautiful sweater cool enough to wear on a florida evening and it will be perfect for vacation the sleeves hit right above the wrist bone exactly as shown on the model and i really like that sheer fabric but still a sweater you will need a cami or tank underneath cant wait to wear it
5,this jumpsuit is so pretty and fits perfectly i am lbs and c and got the xsp and the proportions are perfect i wondered if the pattern would be too overwhelming or busy on a petite frame but its not at all and fits like a glove i removed the little loops that hold the belt because they stuck out too far easy to throw on when im out and about with my kids or dress it up with heels or a wedge for night love
5,this was excellent and my family loved it its a keeper

5,youll need the added space once you start enjoying your new gopro so why not get the bigger storage anyway
5,when i first discovered this recipe in your magazine years ago i gave it a try because it sounded so easy and it was it was exactly like the peanut butter fudge they used to serve in the school kitchen when i was little soooooo good at debbie on nov the butter is used to grease the pan in step at susan on apr maybe you should give the recipe a try before giving it such a poor rating the marshmallow fluff gives the fudge a soft slightly fluffy texture and is not at all gross im not fond of thick dense hard fudge this definitely is not thick and dense or hard its nice and soft and fluffy

5,you can tell from the first episodes who the killer is its predictable but its a charming series didnt get all the tim burton vibes i was expecting its like a cw series but with better pacing and better written characters good acting all around jenna ortega is shining here but the misters could have been way better i get that its for young teenagers but with the amount of mystery killer movies out there they could have done a better job not to be that predictable pros wasnt expecting this to be a murder mystery series cons the mystery is not that intriguing if youve watched a couple of mystery movies before
5,this is exactly what it is supposed to taste like ive tried several recipes but im done looking this is the one
5,this is delicious ive made half a dozen loaves in the past month i have a houseful of pumpkin anything fans better than starbucks dont get the bad review something was off maybe the oven mines turned out perfectly every time

5,its very delicate special for a baby
5,this is our new favorite we leave out the celery but use canned potatoes which cuts down on the cutting time we add a can of stewed tomatoes because a cheeseburger needs ketchup right as many reviewer mentioned this soup tastes even better the second dayif it makes it past the first
5,this is basically the old texas sheet cake baked in a bundt pan instead of the cookie sheet and it can be made using cola like coke or pepsi or dr pepper it can also be make using water i know the beer will give the cake a malty flavor but the water or soda will work too

5,great recipe you can change it up according to what you havecooked chicken instead of hamburger etc once i used hummus instead of refried beans as i didnt have any on hand hummus was great too i also put olives in the layers corn is good tooanything works
5,the otter is so cute and is very soft however its not as snuggly as you might think i understand there needs to be hard parts to make the otter work the top is soft though and my month old loves it since we bought it he sleeps a lot better i would definitely recommend it
5,very very good my family loved it thank you for sharing this recipe

5,you cant beat the value of this micro m a cardbeliever that there is no such thing as a deal of a lifetime when it comes to electronics but for now this card really is a great value
5,excellent my favorite part of the chicken however you could easily swap out thighs for breasts if you arent a dark meat eater if you dont have chinese spice a close substitute is garam masala use the same measurement
5,this top was fun casual with flair it is a little strange that it is see through down to the stomach almost but i would just wear a bra of the same color and dont think anyone would notice i didnt buy because even the sale price is too much for a casual tee in my opinion
5,very good product wonderful
5,hasnt even blinked in my mp player and gave me loads of room for expanding my library i trust the sandisk name with all my electronic gear
5,i have been reading some of the reviews and cant add much else to those that have posted i wanted to give some kudos to women in this episode i remember as a kid watching emma peel and love her being kicka way before it was acceptable i was blown away by the ending but cara dune fennec shan bokatan asohka tano were kicka
5,good value for money laptop for normal use
5,awesome a big hit in my familywill makeagain and again thank you for sharing thisrecipe
5,it is very tasty and litei will difinately be making it again
5,great card that is very fast and reliable it comes with an optional adapter for sd slots being that this is a class card it transfers data really fast and for video this is a must great for gopros and other small cameras alike
5,these cupcakes are excellent batter made cupcakes instead of doz only change i made was added cup raisins to batter at end i almost increased the frosting ingredients slightly
5,wow just wow the best show on tv hands down beautiful people horses and incredible cinematography
5,ive been making this since it very first appeared in taste of home back in ive memorized the recipe all my children have grown up on this and it has become a main staple in our home over the years i love it because it comes from scratch and doesnt use a canned enchilada sauce everything is absolutely the freshest it can be whoever made up the recipe thank you so much
5,this is a very good recipe if needed its easy to change it i had to make some changes i cannot have beans so i didnt put them in i didnt have green chili so i added a can of tomatoes with green chillies it came out great i love recipes that can be changed to fit the person will be making this again
5,excellent recipe i add tsp banana extract and reduce the sugar to cup to release the bread from the pans i place wax paper to fit the bottom grease the wax paper and sprinkle cinnamonsugar on the paper dont grease the sides so that the batter can rise to its maximum while the pans are still warm not hot run a knife along the sides turn out the loaves on a cooling rack i do not use the glaze i use two x pans and bake all my dessert breads at degrees
5,andor so far has been nothing short of a masterpiece i wouldnt be surprised if this show becomes a cult classic in years from the very first episode the great quality of the show is apparent and that quality only increases as the season goes on this show never has a dull moment despite a lot of it being comprised of scenes where people simply just talking the tension and stakes feel ever looming all the time the characters and their actions feel real everything about this show is just amazing from start to finish this show is an absolute treat and i recommend it to anyone who enjoys political thrillers and scifi stuff
5,wow what can i say i submitted this recipe years ago on a whim and it won me and a feature in quick cooking i am so excited to see everyones reviews and modifications i am married now and my family loves this recipe too crazy to see reviews written who knew
5,best choice
5,good deal at a great price it is sturdy and has over gb after its format ill be getting another
5,we really liked this soup especially on a cold fall day next time i will double the beef and half the potatoes
5,excellent everyone in the family loved it
5,its basically an upgraded and much better version of the walking dead the main problem twd has is that zombies are slow which makes it very boring to watch and most of the time humans only died to zombies when theyve made a stupid mistake like running and falling and breaking their leg in the last of us this isnt the case the zombies can run and they are strong as well which makes the show much more exciting than shows like twd the camera movements and perspectives are great you can see that the creators of the show paid a lot of attention to details pedro pascal is killing the role as main actor i already liked him a lot when he was playing the mandalorien hes the perfect fit overall a refreshing new concept of a zombie tv show without the annoying cliffhangers twd has every episode so far this show deserves a from me
5,a real crowd pleaser this is the best chicken pot pie recipe i add extra peas because the everyone likes them
5,i loved this top when i first saw it online and it did not disappoint when i received it in the mail its very lightweight perfect for spring cool summer night early fall i really like the design and like that you can tuck it in there is enough fabric in the front to give it a flowy look that i appreciate bc i will be giving birth soon and my post baby body will likely need some coverage great top
5,i made this soup yesterday and it is wonderful i had my daughter and her family try it as well everyone loved it i didnt have any bouillon cubes so i used equal amount of vegetable broth and no water i also took someones advice and pureed just a little of the cauliflower mixture to thicken the soup this is a wellbalanced tasty soup thanks for the great recipe
5,the best laptop for it engineers the system configuration is very high with a low price i just love it
5,compact simple lag free performance best for streaming
5,yes this is a bit expensive however it is made in the usa so that is a very good thing i appreciate having the opportunity to buy high quality welldesigned basic pieces that are simultaneously supporting my community and country when you are considering this pretty top please click on the gold so that you can see the detail it is very wellmade and flattering i love how it has a slight shape at the back very flattering and feminine the feel and weight of the cotton is remarkably com
5,very good recipe i too added a bit more seasoning to the meat oregano and garlic but otherwise made as written i tend to like my food a bit more spicy so thought maybe id add some dried pepper flakes to the meat the next time very good warmed up the next day too i cant wait for zucchini season to make this again and again
5,i love these pants they are soft versatile and stylish great choice
5,what a delicious and simple soup i cooked it exactly as written and it was perfect we especially liked the slight burn of the red pepper flakes definitely a keeper
5,these jeans are so comfortable they are wellmade they are the perfect pair of jeans the only thing i do not love is they stretch out a little bit after wearing i am going to order these again in the next smaller size
5,these bars were the so delicious they were super easy to make and so quick because the measurements were easy i made it exactly as the recipe called for and they came out light and fluffy not exactly like cake but cakey all of my kids raced and raced about them
5,went together well tasted great i would be very sure to really squeeze out the shredded zucchini mine was a little too moist but still was great
5,i wanted to increase the capacity of my tablet lenovo k to be sure it was at full capacity call me paranoid i checked it on my computer then i moved some files on and off this is one speed demon
5,very cute dress for special occasions or even work dress is comfortable excellent quality but does run slightly large
5,the cake was delicious i did not make the frosting i made it in by pans for a layered birthday cake it was a bit hard to stack but i expected that because i made it in a different pan than intended absolutely delicious though very moist
5,i love this sweater i bought it in black and love the way the back falls gently and flatters my figure im curvy on bottom w a butt and tummy so i like to cover them but i dont want to look like im wearing a moomoo this top looks chic its the right shape to flow gently its just the right detail to be different in an understated way i wear it w leggings and jeggings because it falls low enough to cover my butt neckline is good im a b and its flattering not sure if it will fla
5,very nice laptop at this price awesome features
5,from the moment i saw this top i knew i had to have it the colors of the embroidery are just so beautiful it is even prettier in person than it is online
5,great write speed and lots of space i bought this for my galaxy s and formatted to fat and it works great
5,this is a basic henley and it is made well a wardrobe staple for sure the cut is flattering and the material is soft i ordered the small which is tight fitting im a c for reference
5,i skipped the frosting all together and just dressed it up with ganache dribble centered with strawberries and blueberries i skipped the oil and did it with applesauce what a beautiful cake i wish i could post a picture im proud
5,this is delicious quick easy and fun to make my grandsons and i have made it several times this summer we also decided to expand the idea we have since made orange pie using orange yogurt and orange jello and lemon pie the same way next week we are going to try cherry we think there is a lot a variety possible with these ingredients
5,i always search each summer for a maxi dress and this is the winner this summed i love the way it wraps fits perfectly i got a size medium and i am dd the dress is long enough to wear with flats or heels i recommend this
5,this coleslaw was very tasty because of a low sodium diet i did not add the seasoned salt or the celery salt and it still tasted delicious thanks for the recipe
5,i love the sweater online and even more in person i paired it with a long sleeve top with a bell sleeve and it looked great very bohemian look
5,i made this years ago for my veggie hating kids making it now for my veggie hating grandkids hubby and i love it and the grandkids dont know what theyre eating works for me
5,just picked this up in my retailer store and i love it i bought the orange print and the colors are vibrant and perfect for summer i am and lbs i took a small which is my usual size at retailer could be worn unbuttoned as a sleeveless cardi over a tank i will wear a cami underneath as it is sheer but that doesnt bother me another shopper was trying this on in the fitting room and it looked great on both of us i will wear this all summer long looks great with denim happy find
5,the color was very different and vibrant chose to size up for extra room and length
5,if you have an hourglass figure this dress accentuates your curves i do need to wear a tank underneath as dress is low cut
5,reminds me of your grandmother as well specially of her moist cakes
5,yummy i omitted the shrimp to save turkey smoked sausage is a healthy substitute for regular smoked sausage theresa
5,the performance of this laptop is good amazing price and performance
5,worth the money product
5,cute dress i say true to size but keep in mind it is loose and flowy and i purchased in my usual size medium and it fits perfectly its lined so there is no need for a slip very comfortable and cool i am and it is above knee i paired it with the gemline lariat turquoise necklace and have already received several compliments and my day is only over a great priced dress which holds true to retailers quality and uniqueness of items offered
5,im as big as a star wars fan as the next guy but come on what is disney doing i feel asleep during the first half of the show and had to restart to find out what was going on turns out i didnt miss much i feel like giving up on star wars all together after this is just one bad thing after another and star wars isnt the only one suffering marvel is too as if they cant find competent writers or maybe they are using cheap writers to save money makes sense being cheap and expecting the brand to sell itself it was a good plan but it wont be for long the core fan base is displeased with the creative vision and requires george lucas to step in
5,not much to say about the memory card its doing its job as expected bought mainly because it can store a lot information
5,i have been making this cake for at least years my children now grown have never asked for any other for their birthdaysit was originally in the taste of home magazine
5,this is an awesome vest so soft cozy and i cannot wait to wear it through fall and winter for sake of not repeating all the positive aspects that the previous reviewers did ill mention the one flawno pockets still totally worth full price in my mind though
5,this is creamy and just like at the restaurant i think i will cook the carrots celery and onion in some broth next time though it seemed dry in the pan and when i served the soup the celery was still a little crisp otherwise fantastic easy to follow directions and very tasty
5,fast and giv works great
5,this is always a hit in our house the kids and i made one summer evening a while back and we now make it about every month or so we add a freshly cracked black pepper and sometimes throw in some celery even add croutons when serving great hearty dish
5,a new fav in our house i used only wheat flour and also added cinnamon and nutmegmy husband absolutely loves them
5,i was able to put all my vampirella magazines along with some eerie creepy mad magazines plus some movies like the original nick fury the new black panther the one where hes now a white guy awesome
5,this is a wonderful recipe i used fire roasted tomatoes which gave a really great taste
5,this is very good i plan to make it again for our church potluck thank you karen johnson
5,very nice product very litelove it thank you infinix
5,as i expect from sandisk this card is fast reliable and works great with the gopro comes with the adapterpretty cool to have gig of space on such a small ad cardnot cheap but worth the money in my opinion

5,i have tried many fajita recipes and i was always disappointed until now this one was great only change i would make is to cut back on the salt
5,this tank caught my eye when it first came out couple of months ago love the colors and the embroidery especially the colors on top beautifu and it will complement any skin tone and the bottom is neutral so that this top will go with any bottom this flows too goes great with skinny jeans and flats or put a strappy heels on and its perfect for evening outings
5,the fabric is thin though you better wash it in a bag or the washing machine will tear it up
5,loved this dish i did shred my own cabbage and added a little onion green pepper carrot and tsp white pepper also substituted splenda for the sugar this deserves a star review next time i make this dish i will either make less dressing or add more cabbage as it is a little heavy on the sauce
5,looks professional but wears like a sweater so comfy
5,i bought this shirt along with a matching vest and dusterlove it
5,i used warmed corn tortillas for improved flavor ended up using tomatillo salsa which was what i had on hand this is a very easy and versatile recipe family loved it
5,it would have been nice if there was raj port
5,this is the best meatloaf recipe ive ever tried its moist and flavorful and the topping is just the best ive taught my boyfriend how to make them and we have them with creamy potato sticks you can find that recipe on this website also its just one of our favorite meals we have often
5,the original smell of teenagers in the s
5,product is very good with in this price range it battery is upto hours performance is very good with octa core processor and display is oled which give amazing experience
5,i turned on netflix i see wednesday i clicked it i have watched all the episodes in days the addams family is a classic its hard to continue something what is already an icon tim burton did it very well whole serie was very interesting lots of plot twists we can suspect the monster but then we can change our minds confusing puzzles do not allow you to be sure of the ending great idea great production nice shots nice camera work good script the jokes were really cool so why t owards the end wednesday becomes softer and maybe i dont really like that the main character also has two admirers although wednesday rejects both of them but accepts both maybe it was the love story that spoiled it a bit but i enjoyed it i watched it even twice wednesday is smart funny dark maybe shes like some goth college girl but i dont mind it for sure i wasnt expecting this at all but it was a really nice surprise i hope the show will be continued because the end was the beginning of something new jenna ortega has difficult job to do continue christina riccis job jennas perfomance was fantastic she absolutely knows what shes doing and she feels wednesday she choreographed a ball dance and it turned out incredible shots are good young actors acting is great scenerio is on point just fun show to watch to relax i recommend
5,this jumper is gorgeous i usually dont instantly spend almost on one piece without contemplating but as soon as i tried this on i fell in love i had to order it online because i needed the xsp as the xs in store was way too big please be warned that this runs large and definitely buy the petite if you are petite or a little taller i am for reference and even at its barely short enough to not be too long on me so if you are an inch or two taller i would recommend the pe
5,delicious however i also used less lemon juice and added a bit more olive oil next time i will try it with the white wine
5,there really isnt a whole lot to say about this the amount of storage space is fantasticthere are options for using this on older devices that dont necessarily support microsdxc formats windows by default will only allow you to format the card as exfat or ntfs these formats will work for most new devices but some may have issueif you use fat as the filesystem instead you can use this card for older devices and it still works great with android ive been using this card on my old sandisk sansa fuze running rockbox and it works great i was not expecting that but i am very happy with it
5,i liked the color liked that i didnt have to worry about it getting confused with other microsd cards that i had lying around it functions as i expected given that it was made by sandisk
5,switched the beef out for ground turkey it was amazing
5,did not do any tests but it works great in my galaxy note so far nothing wrong to report recommended
5,great recipe but way too much sugar for our liking i made a double batch this time and used c sugar toral i always add cinnamon with a sprinkle of nutmeg i dont ever have buttermilk so i always use milk and vinegar with great results made loaf pan and mini loaves minis took about mins large took hr mins delish
5,as of today i have watched all five seasons and am not particularly excited about six season which seems to be the last one according to imdb peaky blinders in the beginning of that wonderful tv show seasons i was captured by characters twists in a plot fear of death for favorite heroes and unpredictability of future episodes however season became less tasteful and less intriguing like thomas shelby is an immortal mobster who can survive in every situation without losses and figure out anything ohh yeah and moreover in season you will see him prosper okay so maybe we will see in season the end of career and fall of goliath maybe it will require some patience and time however what if it ends with some cliché ending as mission impossible then it will mostly be a failure sadly it has announcement of series in season and most of the time a good story does not end evenly or rapidly as it was with game of thrones tv series it must have ending as j k rowling books about harry potter i think anyway i hope it will be in a good position with overall good rating and it will not repeat two mistakes from another my favorite tv shows vikings tv series after death of ragnar lothbrok boring times started and game of thrones tv series rapid ending with uneven episode chronométrage and surpassingly illogical characters moves peaky blinders is a good tv show with potential as wine so hopefully it will revive as phoenix and will not simply oxidize or even corked p s mission impossible actually and surprisingly becoming better and better by the year
5,ive been making these ever since the recipe was published and my friends and family love it i triple the recipe and use ground round or ground chuck instead of hamburger i freeze cups of sauce in a freezer bag and cups meat in another freezer bag tripling the recipe makes enough for meals i use this recipe when a friend or family member is sick and needs a meal everyone asks for the recipe the only change ive a made is an omission i dont add salt because theres already salt in the broth and tomatoes i also lean towards the lesser amount of chili powder because i have two daughters who dont like spicy food i love this recipe because it doesnt have any beans making it very kidfriendly
5,im not sure about all the uproar evolving this show so much so i had to come read reviews i could barely get through the first season super slow and boring the best part was jennifer coolidge the teen girls were annoying someone elses turn to eat was off putting at best im all for peoples success if youre not try harder and im not white gen z is probably the worst generation the newly weds were probably the next best story along with the crazy manager everyone says the rd season was the worst so i think i will conclude with season one just not one that i was excited to come back to or eager to watch more
5,amazing blindly go for it
5,my family and me thought this to be a excellent and yummy cake would not change a thing
5,i bought this blouse in a size my normal size to pair with winter white slacks and gun metal pumps it was a hit i felt beautiful and professional and received many compliments at work as well as at an after work gathering the quality is surprisingly sturdy given the lace work the collar and cuffs really set the design off this top is much more impressive in person
5,i just received this blouse and love itmore beautiful in personi got the black one in a petite and it is perfectif you want it longer in the front order a regular
5,after using the laptop for days my observations power backup hrs high booting speed seconds to switch on time great video resolution k display sound quality bit needs to be improved but yes considerable charging time hr type c port is a add on feature webcam is quite good but dont expect a hd camera under this price range over all its a great experience using this laptopso classic looks and beaten the industry in this segment
5,it does the job and the price was right it came quickly so im very happy for the purchase i would recommend it and would but it again
5,this was the first time i had made any version of corn pudding and it was a huge hit our group of adults and kids finished the pan everyone went back for seconds it was the only part of the thanksgiving meal that wasnt leftover so the next day when we were getting ready to eat the leftovers my husband insisted i make another pan i did cook it longer the first time and preferred it compared to the recipe cook time but that was the only change
5,first time making chicken pot pie this recipe yielded z i used a rotisserie chicken and biscuits on top it was fantastic froze one
5,jst amazing machine performance jst a beast
5,good laptop its my first laptop very impressed but battery backup only for hours for normal task performance of this laptop is amazing
5,uh so this is phenomenal the only change i made was adding some white wine to the skillet with the mushrooms so so good
5,very good product i love it
5,i just bought this dress and love the fit im pear shaped and its very flattering its not clingy because it is lined and it has great drape its also seasonless it will look great with boots and a sweater or kimono
5,i added a little of canolli dip in to it and its amazingly good
5,i purchased this early in summer and have worn it a lot you can dress it up or down and since its comfortable you will want to wear it a lot i can wear it for everything from walking the dog to going out to dinner i bought jumpsuits this summer and this is by far my favorite the fit is flattering fitted but not tight and the selftie belt gives your waist definition so the overall look is hourglass i am tall and i normally take an xs or s i went with the s to ensure that it was long
5,i had major doubts about this as a huge fan of the games and books i couldnt see this as a tv show or a movie for that matter the doubts got worse when cast information started to get reported henry cavill as geralt are you kidding me well how happy am i to be proved wrong very very wrong lets start with cav henry cavill is geralt he absolutely nails the part id go as far as to say he was born to play geralt the gruffness the mannerisms are perfect the fight choreography is epic its the geralt fans all know and love yen again major doubts when i saw a picture of the actress but again anya chalotra knocks it out of the park fantastic performance showing us how yen became yen mostly via pain and sorrow and she plays a blinder ciri not much for her to do in this season her time will come but what ive seen of freya allan so far has been very good will be great to see her development going forward not sure why dandelion is called jaskier but his banter with geralt is brilliant and some much needed light relief in this dark world the only weak point in the casting is triss that is not triss she bares no resemblance to her that would be fine but her character bares no resemblance to triss either if they wanted to do something different with the character they picked the wrong actress to do it the timeline bounces about a lot in this season that might be confusing to people who dont know the world and lore i get why theyve done it it would probably take a couple of seasons to show geralt and yens whole backstories so doing things this way we get to know the three main players in season ready for all the fun and games in future series to conclude this has been done brilliantly for the first season people new to the world will have a good idea what the three main characters are about the world is huge and probably a little daunting theyve made a good attempt at explaining things in episodes should probably have been episodes but what weve got in season has been epic and i cannot wait for the next series
5,this sweater is gorgeous the colors are beautiful and the piece itself is soft i do think it is a bit shorter than i would prefer and i tend to wear petites the sweater is nice enough that i do not mind
5,i love this skirt i was happy with the quality of the fabric and style i originally ordered a small but returned and exchanged for a medium which fits great i typically wear a size in pants i look forward to wearing this skirt to work this fall
5,im not gluten free but i wanted to try a gluten free recipe and settled with this one i halved the original recipe and baked just one loaf i also added tsp of cinnamon at first just looking at the texture of a slice i thought i wouldnt like it at all but i tried it and it tasted great it was moist and the flavors are spot on
5,ive tweaked this a little to make it better for me atleast i use teas yeast only rise once it makes it a lot less dense i also changed the temp around somelower like degrees and it seems to make it even softer but still same time
5,i have been making this bread formore than years i add a few handfuls of chocolate chips it makes a star a
5,i bought this memory for my samsung tab so far it works quite well i wish my samsung would recognize the gb
5,easy recipe to follow nice textured bread
5,its good laptop budget laptop its good
5,i tried this last night and was impressed this recipe is a keeper i omitted the refried beans because my daughter absolutely hates them and left out the green pepper cuz im not a fan also substituted corn tortillas for regular tortillas because my husband is severely allergic to gluten but did the rest as described and we loved it will definitely make this again
5,surprisingly flattering and so very soft and comfortable have had many compliments on this super cute paired with skinny jeans and boots also purchased the ausaria infinity scarf in navy which contrasts nicely with this top and a plusno signs of pilling yet
5,i recall making this soup back when i was first getting the taste of home annual recipe books however id used sliced carrots potato chunks cheddar cheese milk and instead of sour cream id used ranch dressing i used lb of ground beef id checked my logbooks of reviews and i dont recall rating this recipe
5,this is an absolutely gorgeous dress that stands out everywhere i go it runs true to size and has a slimming effect because of the detail running down the sides
5,i made this tonight and it was excellent i used chicken breasts and boneless skinless thighs the only thing i had to do was increase the cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce but that is no big thing it was super good and im sure well make it again soon
5,this blouse is adorable very flattering wrap design especially on my small chested body also the black and white is very appealing cant wait for warmer weather so i can wear it
5,i absolutely love the marriage between chocolate and peanut butter so when i saw this i had to make it it was so good that my friend and i ate it until we were insanely full and didnt feel good anymore so the amount this recipe calls forgoes a long way for a lot of guests since its so rick also crush your cookies very well use more butter and melt it so that your crust remains in tack excellent im making it again tonight for a company bbq
5,i am in love with these bought the regular length last year and loved them despite the shortness hit right above the ankle that length looks good with ballet flats or tucked into boots this year i bought the burgundy and the teal in the long length i am and the long fit perfectly they come to the bottom of my ankle without extra fabric please restock the carbon in the long length i want to buy my th pair
5,i was only skeptical if it really works but ive been trying the slumber otter for the first time so back and forth from
5,this is an awesomely told story with some amazing actors and actresses
5,this card is quick and responsive i love that it loads much quicker than my other cards also the price is great
5,i saw the cream top online and loved it but it is even prettier in person i typically purchase petite sizes online but i tried on the in the store and it fit nicely not super fitted throughout the waist as others have mentioned but the length was just right and the armschest fit perfectly for reference im lbs b this will look great with skinny pants or jeans
5,i love this dress for fall it is slightly sheer so i would recommend wearing tights or a slip underneath but it is lightweight enough for fall that i can transition the dress into the season as it gets colder one note i am and was required to size down to an xs in this dress due to length the xs is perfect for work as it hits me slightly above my knees
5,this is star wars as it should be everything is perfect the concept the sound the story the characters cant wait for season
5,this black dress with raised white embroidery is lovely and flattering the fabric has a nice texture and is mediumweight cotton and machine washable the dress is unlined its a bit hard to get on and take off even though the buttons can be undone which helps there is a tie at the waist drawstringstyle i only wish my store had the petite size as i am wondering whether the xs that fit me in the store will still fit as an xs p
5,i absolutely love this i dont normally like pretzels but this dessert is phenomenal for the most part i followed the receipe but i changed a couple things i made it in a x glass dish i used fresh strawberries instead of frozen i did not add any extra sugar i really like the filling so i doubled the cream cheese basically i make the crust than i mix the jello topping and while its in the fridge i make the filling i folded in the whip cream instead of mixing it all together that takes about minutes or so then i poured the jello topping on top and put back in the fridge and it turned out perfect if you follow the directions everything should fit nicely however since i added the extra cream cheese the topping was overflowing i just poured in what fit and it was perfect ive read that people using fresh strawberries add extra sugar to them but i didnt and it doesnt need anybut thats up to you as for the extra jello that wouldnt fit i just put it in a seperate bowl and after it was set up added some whipped cream and had that as an extra dessert everyone loves this desserti will make it for everything
5,i have made this cake multiple times and my family loves it i topped it with strawberries and some whip cream and it is an instant success
5,i absolutely love this shirt i saw it in the retailer store and immediately knew i had to have it all they had in stock was a size and a size im usually a in buttonup shirts but i tried the anyway and found it to be quite generously sized i have a dd bust so buttonup shirts rarely fit me properly this one was big enough to be comfortable worn out or tucked in and was loosefitting without being sloppy when i discovered that it came in petite sizes i asked the so to order t
5,left out the italian dressing used corn tortillas did not use enough i only made one layer of torn tortillas next time i would use more since i suspected there werent enough i sprayed tortillas and baked them the last minutes of the casserole so we had chips i added refried beans along with the black beans and stirred in greek yogurt instead of sour cream i also used ground turkey instead of beef we loved it
5,i love how soft and substantial the fabric is the fabric has a nice weight and drapes beautifully the ruffle detail is very flattering i have broad shoulders and this top looks great
