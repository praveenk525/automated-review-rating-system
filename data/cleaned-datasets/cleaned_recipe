0.0,"Gerri, the oven may have been to high for the yeast and it died, keep in warm moist area, about 80 degrees.  you can put them in the oven on minimal heat but if you do, put them on a large baking dish thats got water on it to keep the humidity up.  Dont bake the bread until the bread has risen to the top of the pan, but not over, otherwise the little it will rise in the oven heat will spill too far over the pan.   Carrie, sugar is the simplest of the &#39;starches&#39; that yeast needs to form, you can use honey or even corn starch,  sugar just allows the yeast to propagate fastest.  if you use honey or starch it will take longer.  if you use these let the yeast work on the liquid mix before adding to the flour, that gives them the boost needed to really work into the flour.  Remember not to put yeast into too hot of liquid mix or it make kill it."

0.0,"I followed the directions completely and when the bread doubled in size (about an hour or less) in the 2 pans, I took them out (always warm in the oven) and shaped them in the loaf pans and baked at 375 degrees and they did not puff up.  I also used all purpose flour."
0.0,"I actually have a question. Does the sugar in this recipe make the bread taste sweet at all? My family does not like regular loaf type bread that is the least little bit sweet. We do love cinnamon rolls and the such, just not sandwich type bread."
0.0,"I just started making &#34;real&#34; bread; parked the ol bread maker. Wanted the Grandmother taste. lol. I made this recipe and it was great. Saw another recipe that sounded &#34;glorious&#34; , adding honey etc. It was BORING, to say the yeast. Came back to this &#34;original&#34; bread recipe and will be making this one from now on. Like artisan bread of which I make a lot of , my question is this. I love a thick hard crust, Sooooo if I were to open the oven; say at the 3/4 cook time and &#34;spray&#34; cool water on the loaves.....would that thicken the crust? Thanks for the great &#34;basic&#34; delicious bread recipe....regards....Dave"
0.0,<p>Me market doesn&#39;t have what you call bread flower. What needs to be added to flour to make it bread flower? I want to try this recipe because bread is the tata of the sandwich and I love a good sandwich.</p>
0.0,I waited three hours and the yeast never did &#34;bubble&#34;. Finally my wife came home and I was going to surprise her but I wanted to ask her from her experience why the yeast was not &#34;bubbling&#34;. SHe said of course she never heard of that and she went ahead and took over. Thanks a lot. Yeast bubbling?
0.0,I just made these it&#39;s an easy recipe and they taste awesome han the house smells amazing

0.0,"OOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH MYYYYYYYYYYY  Five stars are not enough to express how yummy this dish is!  This smelled heavenly, and tasted even better!  We had roast chicken on Sunday and I used the leftover meat and rich broth.  I cut the recipe in half, since I only made one pie.  I didn&#39;t have peas, so substituted cut fresh asparagus for the &#39;green.&#39;  I also added garlic and bay leaves to the roux (removed before pouring into pie shell).   It reminded me of one of those high end chicken pies from the freezer section, but with less calories.  Thanks for the recipe Karen... it will definitely be a regular on our table!"

0.0,Is there a high altitude adjustment available?  We live at 5800&#39; and would love to make it
0.0,"Whole wheat flour is NOT interchangeable with all purpose or bread flour. If you want to make whole wheat bread, find a recipe written specifically for whole wheat. The rise times will be completely different and the flour to liquid ratio will be different, as whole wheat absorbs liquid much more than white flour. Hope this helps!"
0.0,"I dont know what happened with mine!  I followed the recipe and when I baked it, it didnt rise and it&#39;s still doughy. I used whole wheat flour. PLEASE HELP"
0.0,Question it says 2-1/4 does that mean 21/4 cups of water? Or 2 1/4 cups of water which =1/2 cup?
0.0,"Sounds delicious!  Can’t wait to try.  But have a question:  Unfortunately I DO NOT have a standing mixer with a dough hook, so is it possible to make this recipe the “old fashioned “ way?.  Or should I not attempt it..."
0.0,"This is really good bread, but I agree, not every home kitchen has a stand mixer. Last year, I bought a Hamilton Beach auto bread maker for around $40 at Walmart. Even has a gluten free setting. Either bake the loaf in the machine, or pull the dough out to shape, proof and bake as you wish. Why, or why didn’t I do this sooner? Even a moron baker like me turns out fabulous breads and rolls!"
0.0,"If this is supposed to be a recipe for beginning break makers (which I&#39;m not) and you make a video to give added instruction...Shouldn&#39;t the video do it like the recipe states?  In the video she doesn&#39;t put the half teaspoon in with the water and yeast,  she doesn&#39;t show any bubbles on top of the yeast, and she doesn&#39;t let it rise a second time.  I made this recipe to the best of my abilities, followed the written recipe to the letter, and I&#39;m with the other writers who experienced a fiasco.  I don&#39;t see how there can be so many rave reviews.  What really makes me angry is I WASTED 6 cups flour and a pkg of yeast at a time when those 2 supplies are hard to come by.  If I could give this recipe and the author a negative interger of stars I would"

0.0,This soup is easy and delicious!!! 5 stars
0.0,"How could I make this less sodium content, seems quit high. I would use mrs dash and no salt bouillon any other suggestions, I still want to keep the flavour. I also wouldn’t use hot sauce"

0.0,"I love cauliflower soup as the weather gets cooler. It&#39;s so comforting and filling :-)  I adjusted this recipe to make it a lot lighter in calories and fat, and it tastes incredible. Before boiling the vegetables in stock to make the soup, I roasted the cauliflower, onions and garlic first. It adds a lovely depth of flavor. "

0.0,"This will be my third time making this dish via this recipe, it is simple and delicious! Took me about 15 mins to find this recipe after sifting through a bunch of different site recommendations, but only this one would do. I added 2 large garlic cloves and substituted peanut oil for canola, but only on my third attempt, and as it is still marinating, I can only highly suggest the recipe to a T, but that isn&#39;t a bad thing; this recipe is delicious on it&#39;s own! (Approved by my fiance and two children (8&amp;10yrs old)"
0.0,"SO tasty, quick and easy!  I let the chicken sit in the seasoning while I cut the veggies.  I omitted the green onions and since I love veggies used lots of peppers (2 red, 2 orange, 1 yellow, 1/2 a lg poblano and a lg yellow onion).  I lightly salted the veggies as they cooked with some garlic powder.  The chicken was so tender and everything was flavorful-YUM!"
0.0,Made this tonight exactly as directed.  It was good! I&#39;ll probably make this again.
0.0,"I have a question. For whatever reasons, I can no longer tolerate cooked bell peppers. Raw are fine, cooked make me very sick--it&#39;s not pretty. There are so many recipes I make that are enhanced by bell peppers....anyone know of anything that makes a decent substitute and adds flavor to the recipe? Some things (like fajitas) I can keep things separated as I make them but others have to be all mixed together so cannot do. All suggestions very much appreciated."

0.0,Excellent
0.0,I love this recipe and use it frequently!
0.0,Absolutely the best chicken pot pie ever.  I make this often and use whatever veggies I have on hand and it always turns out great.  I use store bought crusts to speed the process and usually only make one pie and use the extra filling as either gravy on top of the pie or on biscuits or toast later.  Excellent recipe!
0.0,"This was one of the best chicken pot pie recipes I&#39;ve ever used!  My daughter loves pot pies, and this one had a real chicken broth gravy and was seasoned just right and really brought the flavors out of the chicken and the vegetables.  I will definitely make this again.  Plus, it was nice to have an extra to freeze for a future dinner!"
0.0,"I apologize, but the amount of thyme you called for was ridiculous. It drowned out every other flavor including the whole chicken we smoked the day before. The idea of the roux-based `gravy` was well constructed, but I used less flour than what the recipe called for, and I found the consistency a bit much. I love the idea of adding potatoes though. The lesson this girl learned today? Stay away from actual written recipes, use your gut instinct, and remember kids, your fingers do the best measuring when cheffing it up :) ONELOVE"

0.0,The video shows no green onions.  It&#39;s an odd choice for fajitas.
0.0,"Very easy and delicious. I used onion strips rather than cubed to go with pepper strips. I had smoked chicken breasts (so pre-cooked) that I cut into strips and marinaded for an hour. They absorbed the marinade and were incredible.  These marinated strips are great by themselves and could be used on salads, in a pasta etc. I&#39;ll use this marinade with smoked chicken breasts by themselves now. So delicious. Fajitas were great too."
0.0,"I make this recipe about once a week. We all love it. A great use for leftovers is to use it as a pizza topping! I buy a whole wheat pizza dough, Muir glen pizza sauce and mozzerella, and top with left over fajita chicken and onions and peppers. It is SOOOOO delicious!"

0.0,Making this bread right now  not sure if it will turn out because I used olive oil  not canola oil   used pizza crust yeast   Its  what I had available at the time .
0.0,This recipe was a total fale in my books not only should you just dissolve the yeast in warm water and then it says to ad your sugar and salt right away with the flour. Did they forget the part where you should let your yeast stand . I prefer to take warm water with suger dissolved in it and then ad the yeast and let it stand. Then after 10 minutes i will mix in the flour salt butter and water and or milk. Mine never even came up an inch. I threw it away
0.0,"Is our family&#39;s favorite soup in the world.  My son-in-law HATES beans, but always requests I make this for him.  I always have to double and triple the recipe because it is gone in a heart beat.  Great with salad and bread."

0.0,"I usually fail miserably at anything connected with yeast but I made 2 successful loaves with this recipe. I took the advice of previous reviewers and mixed the water, sugar and yeast and let it stand to proof it.

With those tips I produced 2 nice loaves. The only thing I would have liked is a finer texture. I&#39;ve only been able to produce that in the past using the sponge method. I will use this recipe again."

0.0,"This recipe worked great!  I have been looking for a good basic bread recipe to go with some amazing jam we are giving away this Christmas.  I looked through the comments and took folks&#39; common advice and it turned out really well!  Bloom the yeast in the warm water with the sugar, mix and let proof for 10 minutes before incorporating the other ingredients.  Also - hand knead this dough.  I am on my second batch having done the hand kneading as opposed to the dough hook this time around and it has turned out even better than the first time.  This is an easy, no-fuss recipe that turns out great."
0.0,Can I safely halve this recipe (particularly the yeast)? There&#39;s just me and my beloved that I&#39;m baking for so I don&#39;t want two loaves (yet).
0.0,Wow this was yummy and yes I licked my bowl out LOL.  I did how ever make a few changes because I&#39;m watching my diet and it was still yummy.  I didn&#39;t put the sour cream in it instead I used plain greek yogert.  Also I didn&#39;t have garlic powder but I did have some garlic so i crushed up 3 cloves. I also used 1% milk not whipping cream and I put two cans of bean in and blended up one can of beans so it would be thicker.   Left overs were even better today!

0.0,"I have substituted/exchanged sweet potato and pumpkin in many sweet recipes.

0.0,haven&#39;t made this yet - concerned about the bottom crust being soggy without blind baking it first - haven&#39;t read that anyone did this... was your bottom crust soggy?
0.0,"This recipe is wonderful! I&#39;ve made it as written several times with homemade crust. It makes enough filling as written for 2 deep dish 9 inch pies, or 3ish normal pie pans. If you do 2 normal pie pans, they will be overflowing and quite saucy. My additions after tasting as written are to add a teaspoon of garlic and 1/2 teaspoon of rosemary and sage. Easy shortcut if you&#39;re in a hurry is to replace the carrot/peas/carrots with mixed frozen veggies! This is my son&#39;s FAVORITE meal - so I just quadrupled the recipe with great success (you&#39;ll need multiple pots if you do)."

0.0,"A cup of butter and a cup of flour to make the roux for the gravy? Preposterous! I fell for it and ended up throwing out most of the flour/butter mess. It&#39;s impossible that other people followed the recipe and gave it any stars at all. I was able to salvage what I had and it ened up quite good, however. Just beware of that cup of butter and cup of flour. Is that a typo or what?"

0.0,"Literally the worst bread I have ever made. I can&#39;t believe it got so many positive reviews. I made this twice. The first time I thought it was my oven that had ruined it, or maybe the yeast wasn&#39;t good enough. However the second time through I had the right ingredients, fixed the oven and I had the worst results. It is best to try another recipe."
0.0,"ok everyone, with bread, more flour = more dense, less flour = more fluffy. I do 1/2 recipes and i rarely use more than 2.5 cups of flour   once you learn this, this recipe, along with your breadmaking skill in general,  is great."

0.0,Wish you would put how much of each ingredient to make only one pie.  Would help on all recipies I think. Thank you.

0.0,"To anyone who has trouble making bread where it comes our hard or too dry.  Making bread is not an exact science.  The amount of flour you use isn&#39;t going to exactly match what is in this recipe.  (or any recipe)  The amount varies depending on temperature and humidity.  If it&#39;s cool and/or dry in your house, you will use less flour.  You will have to adjust by feel and texture as you knead the dough.  Don&#39;t add all the flour at once.   It also helps to have a small pan with some water on the rack below the bread pan.  This adds additional humidity while you bake the bread. (Giving a nicer crust)"

0.0,I had to add some water and a little bit more oil to the recipe. I was not getting the soft dough consistency with the amount of water in the recipe. I added warm water a little bit at a time until a soft dough formed. It ended coming out great though. My boyfriend loved it. He made a sandwich with it and said it was perfect.

0.0,This message is for Cathy. I had the same problem with my bread machine. The solution is to take the dough out after the knead cycle and let it rise in your own pans. It seemed like the machine was not allowing it sufficient time to rise. Bake according to the directions. Good luck!!!!
0.0,"I have made many, many banana bread recipes over the years.  I will never make another recipe again -- this is the winner!

0.0,This bread was good and moist but very sweet.  Too much sugar in this recipe in my opinion.

0.0,Excellent bread with the exception of an overkill on the salt. Should it not be 1 tsp not 1 tbsp. If not why?
0.0,This is pretty much how I make my apple pie but I like the idea of using brown sugar. Also it&#39;s a LOT easier to use a potato peeler to peel the apples. Nice recipe!
0.0,I have bread machine and would like to know if this recipe will help me make better bread in machine..my bread comes out too hard and heavy
0.0,"I followed the directions perfectly and had a blob of sticky dough. I added more flour after turning out onto wax paper because of the lack of work area I have, had to use the stovetop. I added even more flour. after failing in the use of yeast 4 times, I sure hope this bread tunrs out good! it is rising as I type."

0.0,"This was absolutely delicious! My only complaint was that it didn&#39;t make enough; I wanted more leftovers! I used 1/2 tsp salt instead of 1 tsp, and I used 1% milk instead of heavy cream. Turned out great."

0.0,Hi I love this recipe I don&#39;t always have buttermilk so I use yoghurt and I freeze banana&#39;s when on special and slice them into the melted butter mix. And everyone loves it.
0.0,"I put it together in minutes so it is a quick way to use over-ripened bananas.  I do like sugar so I added the recipe amount as well as topped it with Demerara Cane Sugar just so it looks pretty when baked.  I did add craisins, raisins and pecans to the mixture as well."
0.0,"So, when people give this recipe 5 stars, and have altered 8 of the 10 ingredients called for, they are really giving themselves the highest rating. This makes me so angry. Make the recipe the way it is submitted, and give credit to the author."

0.0,"I love Mexican food. This looked so good but tasted sooooo disappointing! I wondered about not adding an entire package of taco seasoning, should have went ahead and added the whole thing. The flour tortillas were a mistake too....just mush and blah. It really didn’t taste like an enchilada casserole at all. It had potential but just a huge fail taste wise."

0.0,"<p>Not sure if anyone else commented on this but the meat mixture makes an AWESOME CHIP DIP!  This is our second time having this.

I was so hungry that I had a taste on a tortilla chip and we actually ate it like that for dinner!  Put some in a bowl, topped with shredded cheese and voila!

0.0,OMG make sure you grease AND FLOUR the TWO (2) pans you will need. One pan is not enough for this much dough. AND it DOES NOT take 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours to bake. 45 to 55 min is MORE then plenty to bake 2 loaves. Enjoy

0.0,"Loved it! However, I did what several other reviewers suggested and used corn tortillas instead. To keep the tortillas soft versus &#34;grainy&#34;, I cooked them in a little canola oil for about 15 seconds each and drained on paper towels. (I know this totally added to the calories, but we don&#39;t like the flour tortillas because they become soggy) I did use more cheese - probably closer to 2 cups (jalapeño jack and cheddar). Other than the extra cheese and corn tortillas, I followed the recipe exactly as written. I have to say that I always viewed lettuce and tomatoes on these types of casseroles as &#34;optional &amp; pretty garnish&#34;, but it is a must for this casserole! Almost tastes like a taco salad. Thanks so much for the recipe; I was REALLY tired of making the same old ones I&#39;ve been making forever!Karla"

0.0,"Perfect banana bread, just as written. However, due to health reasons I have successfully substituted coconut milk for the buttermilk, reduced the sugar to 1cup and reduced the oil to 1/4 cup by adding an extra banana. And just for personal taste and to look pretty, I like to sprinkle the walnuts (mixed with a bit of sugar) on the top of the bread just prior to baking."

0.0,"I made this pie, boiled the gelatin, but wound up having tidbits of gelatin, did not mix well with the yogurt, but it does need a tad bit more of lime juice. I like that it was light and airy. Will make again, but try to boil the gelatin longer maybe."
0.0,I don&#39;t use the bouillon cubes but something called better than broth. It&#39;s a paste that has way more flavor and less sodium. A tablespoon is enough to flavor about 5 cups of water with a real chicken flavor

I made a double batch and served it for dinner one evening and it really made a hit. Since there was a small amount left I put the leftover in the refrigerator. I walked into the kitchen the next morning to see our son in law with a big bowl of it headed for the microwave, which puzzled me. He gave me a big smile and told me it was the first thing he thought of when he woke up that morning and that was his breakfast. I give this soup 5 stars!"

0.0,"This recipe is great but to make it better I used half beef half bulk sausage; I also added one onion medium size for a single recipe, or a large for a double recipe. I used all beef broth instead of water and bouillon.   And, if you are a garlic fanatic like me, then add a couple of tablespoons of garlic, you can start out with less and add more if you would like.  Last but not least if you feel that you still don’t have enough flavor use about a tablespoon or so of onion soup mix, that definitely secured the flavor for me,   Ok that’s all...just my little tweaks.  Oh, and you must serve this soup with homemade bread topped with Land O’ Lakes Olive Oil and Sea Salt butter spread.    DELISH!"

0.0,I love this recipe. I&#39;ve used it dozens of times and it always turns out. Sometimes I add choc chips or coconut and it is always delicious and moist. I use half the sugar and use vanilla flavoured stevia drops in place of vanilla. It adds enough sweetness. I also use whole wheat flour.   I replace the oil with apple sauce. Even with all these exchanges it turns out great
0.0,I haven&#39;t made it for awhile but think I put a little salsa on the bottom of the pan to keep the tortillas moist.  I mashed up the black beans the 2nd time I made it so our youngest GS wouldn&#39;t find the beans.  He loves the casserole when the beans are mashed....wouldn&#39;t eat it the 1st time because he found a whole black bean &amp; announced he &#39;doesn&#39;t eat beans&#39;.

0.0,I have not made this yet but I do not understand why recipes for enchilladas use flour tortillas.  Corn tortillas have so much more flavor and texture! I will try it with corn tortillas.
0.0,This was a tasty meal and my family enjoyed it.  The only thing I didn&#39;t like was the tortillas that were on the greased edge of the pan got hard and basically inedible but overall it was a good meal.  I think the mixture would also be good inside a burrito!

0.0,"This is the best apple pie filling recipe I&#39;ve ever used. I have learned to cook my filling until apples are half done..so the &#34;juice is less runny and your crust doesn&#39;t over brown before the apple filling is done.

0.0,"This is a very good basic apple pie recipe.  As with any recipe, tweaking may be needed to suit your personal tastes, and reading the directions carefully is also mandatory.  When reading reviews, I noticed several folks complaining about their pie being under-done, then saw one lady who said she had to add time to the initial 25 minutes, when the recipe specifically calls for an additional 20-25 mins, after foil is removed.  I suspect more than one person undercooked their pie by not reading the recipe correctly."

Everyone loves it when I serve it."
0.0,"We really enjoyed this! I did make some changes though. I used ground chicken, and I used a half a jar of marinara sauce I had leftover instead of plain tomatoes. I also added pepperoni on top of half (left the other half with just the peppers). Even the kids ate it! I&#39;ll definitely be making this again."

0.0,"Is there an egg substitute we can use for the egg whites? Also, if we use heaping tablespoons of flour, it will prevent the filling from being too watery right? Just want to confirm."
0.0,i don’t recommend this recipe. The pie had a lot of juice left at the bottom but the pie was still dry. I followed the recipe exactly and it looked good until i tried it. TOO MUCH cinnamon and nutmeg and my apples were still crunchy...
0.0,"This pie is amazing! I like pie, but my family doesn&#39;t really care for it. My daughter received a school assignment to bak an apple pie, so this is the one we chose. I only made one change; I didn&#39;t have any cardamon so I sprinkled I a pinch of all-spice instead. The pie took longer to bake than directed, but the end result was worth the wait! I found the Taste of Home pie notes listed right after the recipe helpful, and also followed one of the the reviewer&#39;s recommendations to use heaping tablespoons full of flour. The pie wasn&#39;t runny or dry; it was just perfect! The only change I will make next time is to add another cup pf apples. I used 7 cups of thinly sliced honey crisps, but they cooked down quite a bit. My daughter has declared this the only pie she likes, and my husband refused to let me take a couple of pieces to my parents; he wanted the leftovers for himself!"

But I will definitely be making this again!   (2 weeks later)  My husband asked me to make this meatloaf again for supper tonight, proving that he really liked it. It&#39;s so good, and easy to make.

0.0,"This is delicious!  I usually make it a few times a month in the fall and winter as it is one of the few meals that everyone in my family will eat.  I’ve adapted it a little to suit my family’s tastes.  I use a combination of sharp and mild cheddars instead of Velveeta, and I use a combination of peeled russet (all purpose) potatoes and unpeeled Yukon gold potatoes as I like the different textures.  Sour cream is not something that I keep on hand, so I rarely add it in.  We drink fat free milk, so I often use that instead of buying whole milk  just for using in this recipe.   To change things up from time to time, in place of ground beef, I’ve used both ground and link sausages (sliced thin) and cubed ham.  I’ve also left the meat out altogether and doubled the potatoes.  When using ground meat, I typically use a whole pound instead of a half pound.  Any way I make it, we like to sprinkle some bacon on top!  Enjoy!"

0.0,So nice on a cold night! Great with cornbread to round out the meal. Very easy to make. The hardest part was chopping all the veggies. I did substitute 2 tablespoons of cornstarch for the flour. I just mixed it in with 1 cup of the milk that was called for. Thanks for sharing.

0.0,"It looks good, but I can&#39;t have the cheese. Why does everything have to have cheese? What can I use in place of it?"
0.0,Used sausage instead of bacon. Added mushrooms and green peppers. Love this recipe!
0.0,"My grandsons love this casserole. I have to make 2 for the 6 boys!  Always a hit!  I use 1 1/2 pound drained sausage, and a dozen eggs for each casserole and more cheese and potatoes. One casserole doesn&#39;t feed a dozen people."
0.0,Would like to cook in crockpot. Any idea how long to cook ?
0.0,This is just White Chicken Chili with I first experinced eating at at local restaurant in Indianapolis which was recommended to me by the waiter. It&#39;s delicious! But that is what it is called - White Chicken Chili.
0.0,I would make this soup again.  It was a hit.  I would only add 1 can of green chilis when I make it again.  The leftovers were pretty hot.
0.0,I always use chocolate crumbs for the crust and a little sprinkly on top.  Instead of Cool Whip I find Carnation milk healthier. You freeze the milk until crystals are forming along the sides and then you whip it.
0.0,"I have made this with strawberry jello &amp; yogurt, lemon jello &amp; yogurt,orange jello &amp; yogurt,raspberry jello &amp; yogurt and peach jello &amp; yogurt &amp; they are all delicious!!!"
0.0,re: zucchini cupcakes---these are so moist and full of flavor--if you don&#39;t want to frost em just have them with cool whip!!

0.0,I have made this recipe in the past it is the best and easiest keylime pie recipe ever.  I have tried lots of keylime pie but nothing comes close to this one!
0.0,"To use real key limes, add them to yogert, and to juice them use a garlic press.  Works great.  Donita Lindamood"
0.0,Very moist with a nice crunchy crust.  I used 3 bananas and added chocolate chips. This was a very good combination. I substituted milk and vinegar for the buttermilk.
0.0,To Mary...I used salted butter and they turned out great. I only use unsalted if it&#39;s specified in the recipe.
0.0,Hello im  about to make this recipe. One question can I use regular milk instead of buttermilk?
0.0,I just made these and the frosting seems awfully dense......shouldn&#39;t there be some milk or half and half mixed in with conf sugar to make it light and fluffy?
0.0,"I make this pie all the time and it is wonderful.  It is low in calories, sugar and fat so is a good snack for those of us that have to watch our weight.  Try different jellos and yogurts.  Black cherry is especially yummy!lkkboyd"
0.0,"For a true Key Lime flavor, use 1/4 cp. of fresh Key Lime juice in place of the water."
0.0,<p>This is &#34;easy as Pie&#34;  and I have tried it with lemon jello and lemon yogurt.  It&#39;s light as a cloud  and oh so yummy!!</p>
0.0,Fixed this last night for my weekly dinner with my grandsons. There was not a drop of it left it was that good.
0.0,"Believe it or not - I have purchased bad powder before.  You can test the freshness of your powder by putting<span> a few tablespoons of warm water (warm tap water is fine, but cold water is not) into a small bowl and adding a teaspoon of baking powder. It should make a fizzing noise and then the baking powder will begin to fizz and the water will become very cloudy with tiny bubbles. The more bubbles, the fresher the baking powder.</span>  The other thing you should do is double check your oven temperature.  Oven thermometers are inexpensive and imperative to baking.  My own oven tends to run hot."
0.0,Question... Do you have to drain the zucchini to release the moisture?
0.0,WONDERFUL  WONDERFUL  WONDERFUL   AND EASY.  YUMHO
0.0,I have been making this for several years.   I also make it with strawberry.
0.0,"Using pureéd fresh pumpkin would likely alter the taste of this recipe quite a bit, if not drastically.  I am a huge fan of using fresh pumpkin substitute an many pumpkin recipes though, and happy to learn someone has provided guidance to alter, thanks keverwann.  But I made it with canned pumpkin exactly as written because of the raves and they turned out fabulous!  Definitely a keeper here!"

0.0,This pie was so easy to make and delicious. My family and I loved it.  It is so light and you feel good about going back for seconds. Thanks for sharing
0.0,I think Your kitchen tip of “ lightly beating “my cupcakes actually caused them to have zero air and therefore didn’t rise.  So now I have dense flat cupcakes. Not a good tip for Coloradoans Good flavor but....
0.0,"I want to make this but I want to use mini foil pans, do I need to change anything ?"

0.0,"These are delicious! My frosting did not come out fluffy as shown, but then my mixer broke before I was done. Very moist. Cake and frosting are a great compliment to each other."
0.0,"I made 2 batches of these for my husband to take to work.  They were a huge hit.  I kept some home with no icing on them because I can&#39;t have dairy, and they were really good with no icing too!  If I were to change anything, I might use a touch less cloves.  I think people that don&#39;t like the intensity of cloves won&#39;t like these much, so try them with less and you might find another way to use all those zucchini!"
0.0,"I loved it.  I am going to make two for a spaghetti fund raiser for the youth at our church.  Everyone that had a piece of the pie loved it.  My husbgand isn&#39;t into yogurt, low fat, etc.  He gave it a thumbs up.  Thank you, Helen"
0.0,Absolutely horrible. I&#39;m a great cook and this turned out terrible. I even added things to help it and it was terrible! I&#39;m entering a chili contest tomorrow and this will definitely notgo in.
0.0,I made the orange Dreamsicle version and it was great.  Will definitely make this again.
0.0,HELP!  I tried this recipe yesterday and it did not set up.  It had plenty of frig time.  Any suggestions would be great - the family loved it anyway.  Only change was used regular jello as I did not have sugar free on hand.

0.0,I made this over the weekend.  My husband and I are both diabetic so I used SF jello and SF whipped topping.  I didn&#39;t put it in a crust....I just crushed several graham crackers and spread them on the bottom of pie pan and then poured the topping on.  It was great!  Re: the comment about the pie not setting up; I wonder if she put too much water in it.  You don&#39;t put the two cups like the jello box instructs....this recipe only calls for 1/4 cup.
0.0,I use only sugar free Cool Whip!  It doesn&#39;t taste any different to my husband &amp; I.  I am thrilled we have it available as he is a diabetic!
0.0,"I am also a diabetic and this pie sounds wonderful!  They do make sugar free cool whip in the frozen aisle, too, which would bring the sugar content down even more."
1.0,I followed this recipe exactly and would never made this dish again.   Everyone who tried it thought it was missing something and I agreed.    Maybe green peppers or ground mustard?
1.0,The recipe is too salty 😅
1.0,I didn&#39;t like this at all. Way to much cheese.  I wish I would have followed my first thought of only adding half the cheese.  I gave some to my neighbors and they too felt the same way.
1.0,"This is the HIGHEST RATED recipe on the WHOLE SITE?  Hamburger and potatoes swimming in processed cheese and loaded with calories, carbs, fat, and sodium?  This looks like Hamburger Helper only someone forgot the pasta and threw in potato chunks.  Ground beef swimming in melted processed cheese is the best of the best!?!  I&#39;m surprised the instructions didn&#39;t suggest dipping some mayonnaise on white bread sandwiches in it to complete the theme."
1.0,"Have not made this, would like to know what recipe to follow? Did any one make it by the original recipe???? and how many  star did it get???????"
1.0,Did not like at all
1.0,"Made this pie for Thanksgiving Dinner. I should have read the reviews. I have made many pies, this was the absolute worst I have ever produced. I used my normal crust recipe with this one for the filling. Like the others, my crust looked beautiful, but when we cut into the pie, it was a mess of undercooked apples with a ton of runny juice. It never set up! This recipe needs to be removed, it definitely does not work the way it’s published. You guys should be ashamed of it! Readers should not have to tweak your recipe in order to make it work! Remove please!"
1.0,"This isn&#39;t pie. This is soup. I don&#39;t know if the creator forgot to add a step or what, but my finished product was more liquid than apple. If this is &#34;grandmas&#34; recipe, she must have had soft teeth.  Recipe should be removed."
1.0,"The description says &#34;Maybe it&#39;s the cream cheese! &#34; Where is the cream cheese in the recipe ingredients? It says sour cream and whipping cream, NOT cream cheese."
1.0,"Wish I had read more reviews.  It was awful ... I baked it 20 minutes longer than indicated and still the apples are not cooked, the filling is liquid.  I used a mix of Honeycrisp and Granny Smith.  I&#39;ve been baking for 45+ years but am looking for a no fail apple pie.  It was a beautiful pie, unfortunately it was inedible.  A huge waste of an afternoon."
1.0,I was disappointed in this bread.  I wonder if the 1 tablespoon of salt is correct - I don&#39;t think I have ever added 1 tablespoon of salt to anything I have made.   I thought this bread tasted too salty.  I didn&#39;t have canola oil so I used olive oil and  sprayed the pans with Pam - not sure if those things had anything to do with the salty taste.  I will not be making this again.
1.0,"Extremely disappointed.  While it was tasty -- I added oregano and garlic to the sauce -- it came out a wet mess.  Since I drained the meat mixture well and used sauce right from the can without adding water all I can think is 10 minutes isn&#39;t nearly long enough to salt-drain the zucchini, which I pressed to drain in the strainer and then squeezed in a towel."
1.0,"Worst apple pie filling recipe EVER! I followed the instructions exactly and after an hour of cooling, I cut the first piece. I had to drain more than a cup of liquid out of it. I&#39;m so upset. Flavor is also lacking. I cannot tell you how disappointed I am with this recipe."
1.0,Came out like soup with 1 TBS of liquid  The apples didn’t get soft
1.0,recipe sucks there was a lot of liquid in the bottom of the pie even with a lattice top
1.0,this recipe has been on allrecipes.com for years...not liking copycats!!
1.0,This is the first time I used someone elses recipe and not my own that I have used for years.  Flavor was OK but each one of my 8 little loafs all stuck to the bottom of the pan.  I will be going back to my recipe.  Sorry.
1.0,This was one of the worst recipe I have ever tried from your site.  It was a total mush bunch of green goop and I had to throw it out.  What a waste of my time it preparing it.
1.0,"Way to much cheese, to little eggs, only 2 out 10 people finished it."
1.0,Way to watery.
1.0,"I&#39;m always amazed how people rate a recipe 5* and then state how they changed the recipe -- significantly.  So, after reading all the comments, I&#39;ve read I&#39;m not sure whether to even try the recipe.  Why people can&#39;t just do a recipe without changing it is beyond me.  How do they know what the &#34;real&#34; recipe is like to even begin to rate it?"
1.0,My pie turned out beautiful and then I cut into it... full of liquid and overly sweet! Such a disappointment.
1.0,This was terrible it looked good when i took it out of the oven and when i cut into it a ton of liquid came out. I was so excited to make the pie and ended up just throwing it away. Would not recommend.
1.0,This was a disaster for me. The jello turned into little balls when I whisked in the yogurt.  The only thing I can think of is that the yogurt was too cold and caused the jello to start to set.  Maybe it would have worked if I had allowed the yogurt to warm up a bit first.  I had to throw it away.
1.0,"Followed the recipe to the letter. Pie looked great on the outside,  but was a soupy mess on the inside. I will not make this again and I do not recommend it."
1.0,I do not recommend this recipe. The cooking times are way off and there was so much juice in the pie I had to dump most of the juice out.
1.0,"AHHHHH!  HOW CAN YOU EVEN CALL THIS KEY LIME PIE, NO KEY LIMES IN IT!KEY LIME PIE IS NOT GREEN...WHAT ARE YOU THINKING"
1.0,Four out of four adults in this family did not care for this at all.  It was too rich and greasy with all the cheese.
1.0,The pie is tooooooo sweet. Use less sugar
1.0,"I agree with pjmcbride.  A key lime pie is NOT GREEN. Where is the key lime juice?  What part of this pie even comes remotely close to a true key lime pie???????  I would NEVER, EVER, EVER make this sad imitation."
1.0,"I really didn&#39;t care for this soup at all. Sorry to say it was a throw away, a waste of time. I&#39;ve enjoyed others better."
1.0,"Too salty, I even omitted the pre salting,  lacked substance...waste of my good zucchini!"
1.0,My family didn&#39;t like it the zucchini was too soggy.
1.0,"I followed this recipe exactly.  It was so blah, no flavor at all.  I kept adding more cheese and seasonings.  It looked good but had no taste."
1.0,Fail!?? followed the recipe to par but the bread didnt rise at all. Not sure what eent wrong but the flour didnt rise before or during baking. Any suggestion or idea why?
1.0,"I was really excited to make this soup after reading all the great reviews.  I have to agree with the one review I read that said it was basically Hamburger Helper without noodles.  Actually, I think Hamburger Helper tastes better then this.  The only change I made was to add a some bacon at the end.  My husband and I did not care for this at all."
1.0,"This is absolutely the WORST Key Lime pie I have ever tasted.  Maybe it&#39;s because I am a native Floridian but this is terrible.  No one in my family would eat it and I had to throw it away.  I made it on a trip to St Louis because I couldn&#39;t get key lime juice, but it was a waste of time and money.  Disgusting.  By the way, Key Lime pie is NEVER green.  If it&#39;s green, it&#39;s not the real thing."
1.0,Horrible recipe.  I am actually quite surprised it turned out so horribly. I spent $30 on all the ingredients and almost knew it would turn out amazing due to all the great reviews and five star rating. There was not nearly enough sauce to call it lasagna. The flavors were way too strong and the pork sausage was the wrong choice. There was also not enough lasagna noodles in this recipe. So many things I didn&#39;t like about this dish. What a waste of food and time. Don&#39;t waste your time.
1.0,"Followed this recipe to the t, it sucked."
1.0,At a loss how this recipe became a contest winner....had better in a hobo camp
1.0,"The meat stayed very soft, the oats were completely the WRONG starch to add, and the sauce was sickeningly sweet.  It couldn&#39;t even be salvaged by being made into a sandwich.  I can&#39;t believe so many people liked this.  Gross, just plain gross!"
1.0,bland...I think jimmy dean original sausage would have been better.   probably won&#39;t cook again.
1.0,"This recipe was given to me by my neighbor. I thought I would make it today and it turned out horrible.  OMG, it was terrible. The bread did not rise at all. I&#39;m not sure why this happened ? I&#39;m not sure why everyone has given this bread recipe five stars?  If I could I would give it zero.  I have made bread before and it always turned out great. I followed the directions to the tee.  I am thinking I should have used bread flour instead of all-purpose flour.  I am very disappointed I&#39;m planning on throwing this recipe in the garbage.  I plan on making bread from the youtube channel (Jenny Can Cook.) Now,  JENNY can make delicious bread and it turns out good every time."
1.0,didn&#39;t like it
1.0,"This was terrible.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It tasted fine until I added the sour cream and whipping cream.  Then, it turned into a thin, white, flavorless soup.  Do not bother."
1.0,"didn&#39;t like it - too creamy, too rich - i didn&#39;t feel good after having it.  sour cream &amp; whipping cream is overkill. would&#39;ve been better with just whipping cream."
1.0,My husband and I didn&#39;t like this recipe.  It had an aftertaste that was unpleasant.  I think from the Italian dressing.
1.0,"Even using only 1 can of green chilies, it was much too hot for us.  Did not like at all."
1.0,"Mine was a total disaster, raw in the middle and so dense. I cut the crust thinly off and they were yum. I think the recipe  is confusing  as i read it 2 1/4 cups of water and   3 cups flour  then it asked me to add . Mix till smooth well it was dough at that point  couldnt add in any more flour"
1.0,"The meat stayed very soft, the oats were completely the WRONG starch to add, and the sauce was sickeningly sweet.  It couldn&#39;t even be salvaged by being made into a sandwich.  I can&#39;t believe so many people liked this.  Gross, just plain gross!"
1.0,Possibly if this soup was renamed as a Bean Soup it would be more fitting.  This soup in no way is a White Chili soup.  Very dissapointing.....
1.0,Followed recipe to a T...set oven to 325 and baked for an hour...checked with toothpick method...left in for another 15 min as directed...bread came out hard as a rock...could not cut it with any knife in my kitchen...had to use hack saw to cut it...never again!
1.0,I love your recipes. But wasn’t a crazy about this on:(
1.0,Li&#39;l Cheddar Meat Loaves Skip the sickeningly sweet topping. The mini loaf idea was very good but will use my own meatloaf recipe which has alot more flavor. 
1.0,This bread was terrible. Was hard to get out of the pan because it slightly .overflowed. Nothing but a gooey mess. Waste of ingredients
1.0,Can&#39;t wait to try
1.0,I always bake  banana bread  and its  recipe is fool proof.I tried this recipe last night and I am sorry to say it was not a very good one ..it took 2 hours and still it was soggy.. So maybe  if we put less buttermilk in it result  might be different.. I like the taste of it tough. Nasira Mansoor
1.0,Li&#39;l Cheddar Meat LoavesSkip the sickeningly sweet topping. The mini loaf idea was very good but will use my own meatloaf recipe which has alot more flavor.
1.0,There are much better white bread recipes out there. Recipes that use milk rather than water make a much better bread that is easier to slice and use for sandwiches. Disappointing.
1.0,Don&#39;t call it &#34;traditional&#34; and include cottage cheese. What a disaster.
1.0,Too bad and too sweet
1.0,Very underwhelmed!  With all the fabulous reviews I was hoping for so much more.  Followed recipe exactly but didn’t have hot sauce..might’ve helped a little but I doubt enough to make me want to make again.
1.0,Made this for Xmas breakfast. It was the most tasteless breakfast casserole I have ever made.Glad I also made biscuits and sausage gravy. I had 3/4 that I had to throw in the garbage. Would not recommend at all. Too many other great breakfast casserole&#39;s available.
1.0,"This is by far the worse recipe I have used for banana bread.it calls for way too much oil,I bake dog treats for a living and they smell better than this bread."
1.0,Honestly....this was truly the grossest soup I’ve ever made and I was so excited
1.0,"I don&#39;t mean any insult, but hamburgers do not have potatoes in them.  There is a much better recipe on Food Network from Diners, drive-ins and Dives.  Sorry."
1.0,"For anyone who thinks this recipe looks good don&#39;t be deceived. For me, it looks like vomit and it tastes the same even substituting REAL cheese for that Velveeta plastic cheese. I&#39;m sorry if I sound like a snob but Velveeta is for those who have no idea what real cheese."
1.0,"NO!  Bland and dry. Yes, I followed the recipe.  Into the garbage after so much prep. Yes, I&#39;m irritated."
1.0,"I was so eager to try this reciped for a friend who loves pumpkin spiced cupcakes. I made this recipe to the T; using all of the same ingredients, following the instructions exactly, and making sure to bake them at the right temperature and everything. I dont understand, but my cupcakes are coming out songey/mushy, and not rising at all. I dont think its the baking powder, because I just bought a new one the other day. If anyone knows why this is happening, Id really appreciate it if you could let me know ): Really sad the batter and frosting will all have to go to waste."
1.0,Very bland.
1.0,This is a disaster too long cooking waste of time and money.
1.0,"I wouldn&#39;t bother with this recipe again. Very little flavor except cauliflower, instructions are iffy at best ( 2-1/2 cups of water to cover the veggies, really?) My boyfriend &amp; I ate it, but I threw the rest of it out as well as the recipe itself."
1.0,"My husband and I didn’t like it because of the flour tortillas. Should use corn tortillas. He thought bottom tortillas were hard from the baking. I had leftovers next day and the tortillas were mushy, pretty gross. Also, it bubbled over onto the bottom of my oven the last 5-10 minutes, uncovered, in an 11x7 Pyrex."
2.0,"<p>This recipe was not terrible, however I do not care to make it again.  The family did not care for the recipe either.</p>"
2.0,"So, after reading all of the many raves about this, I thought for sure it would be better then the banana bread recipe that I already have. It was not. It was moist on the inside but way too hard on the outside. I did use lemon juice and milk instead of buttermilk and I just used 2 bananas like the recipe called for rather then the three that many of you recommended. Perhaps that is why, mine did not turn out so great."
2.0,"I made this, but may have made a mistake doubling the recipe (to accommodate my bounty of overripe bananas). I thought my pans were the right size, but one of the loaves ran over in the oven. And even though I greased the already non-stick pans, I couldn&#39;t get either loaf out of the pan intact. Having said that, the flavor was good, and I will try the recipe again and re-adjust my star level."
2.0,I have hard time calling this the &#34;best ever&#34;. It took 30 min longer than estimated to bake and the top was all crusty and dark because of the high amount of sugar. I also made a batch of the basic banana bread muffins and preferred that recipe a lot more.
2.0,good one
2.0,Don’t know  what these people are talking about it’s not even a pizza as the zucchini crust never gets crispy it’s a casserole
2.0,We wanted to try this based on all of the good reviews.  But we did not like it.  Little flavor and a lot of work.
2.0,These instructions are not clear for a first time baker.🙄🤦🏽‍♀️
2.0,We did not enjoy this casserole.  My family all agreed that our all-time favorite egg casserole by Jimmy Dean is MUCH better.

2.0,"This recipe was not terrible, however I do not care to make it again.  The family did not care for the recipe either.  "
2.0,"Was disappointed in the runniest of this  pie. Had to use several paper towels to sop up runny juices. Did not read reviews  before putting top crust on. Would suggest  Taste of Home  re-write recipe. It for sure needs more flour. On the upside has a good flavor. We used HoneyCrisp, Gala, MacIntosh and some sort of fancy apple. Just disappointed it was runny."
2.0,I don’t understand the high ratings. This would have been flavorless had I not added extra seasoning. Hard to believe this won any contest.
2.0,"We just moved into a house we bought and it had apple trees, don&#39;t know what kind they were but the sauce did not thicken up . My crust was good does it matter what kind of apples i used? I cooked it longer then what it said . any suggestions for next time?"
2.0,this dessert is definitely simple- but it tastes exactly like what it is... just yogurt and coolwhip sweetened with jello mix.
2.0,The flavor was good but I did find it a little too moist and left me feeling like it was too oily.
2.0,"So so recipe.  It&#39;s more like a soup than a hearty chili.  The recipe calls for WAY too much chicken stock.  Half that amount would have been more than enough.  The chili never thickens no matter how long you cook it.  Again, this should be called soup not chili.  Way better chili recipes out there.  Won&#39;t make again."
2.0,"This pie was a soupy mess!  I even followed the advice of another reviewer and reduced the juices and sugars of the apples before assembling the pie.  Also, the apples were very thinly sliced and did not cook through after 50 minutes of baking when the crust was done.  The flavors were very good but the way it baked up was unacceptable, especially for so much work.  I&#39;d be less disappointed if I had used a store bought crust and saved the time and effort.  Will NOT make this again."
2.0,Just okay. It&#39;s your average banana bread.
2.0,Needs a thickening agent. I let this pie sit for over a day and a half and it was still way too runny. Had a decent taste but the cinnamon and nutmeg was a bit over powering.
2.0,I&#39;ve been making Cheeseburger CHOWDER for 20 years my recipe is better...but nice attempt    lol Velveeta
2.0,"I decided to make it today after reading the reviews, but it was extremely sweet. I won&#39;t make it again."
2.0,My rating has to do with the equipment used. This is supposedly a recipe is for &#34;beginners&#34;. How many beginners have a dough mixer? Instructions for making the bread truly &#34;by hand&#34; would be wonderful.
2.0,"Was just ok for us. We felt like it was missing flavor. Just needed something. Probably won’t make again,"
2.0,"First off, pie didn’t taste bad. HOWEVER, all this talk of grandmas special apple pie is disingenuous, at best. The pie came out with a lot of liquid. I like a nice wholesome and crispy apple pie. Not a wet apple pie. This pie is Grandmas WAP (wet a** pie)."
2.0,"You should use milk, not egg white to brush on the pie crust. Pie crust edges do not need to be covered with foil until the end, if they’re browning too quickly. Time given is not long enough to cook the filling. It needs twice as long as stated here. It also needs a higher starting temperature. It should be baked at 425 degrees for the first 20 minutes then turned down to 375 degrees to bake for a further 40 minutes or so. Also, I used Bramley apples and it came out a bit tart so I’d increase the sugar and also the flour and it is liquidy."
2.0,"Horrible recipe ! The sauce was a stark white, tasteless paste that no amount of &#34;doctoring&#34; after the fact could resolve. A total waste of ingredients and home made pie crust. A much better option is to make your chicken stock ( or use store-bought stock ) and thicken it using 1 tbsp cornstarch mixed with 1/4 cup cold water and simmer until it thickens before adding the chicken and vegetables. That way you still have chicken gravy not flour gravy."
2.0,threw most of it down the garbage disposal........not tasty at all.......not cheesey enough.....
2.0,Would be better without the cotton cheese and the provolone in my opinion. And more spices
2.0,Not a fan. Too salty and the gravy overpowered the taste of the veggies. I wish I had found another cauliflower recipe. :(
2.0,It was horrible. The Italian dressing does not belong in a Mexican casserole. It overpowered all the other flavors. Even the dogs wouldn&#39;t eat it!
2.0,"Definitely not a keeper for our house.  Made exactly according to directions and our 2 year old pushed her bowl away saying “No, thank you! Yuck!”, the teenager tried two bites and decided on a sandwich, and the two adults ate it but said never again. Will stick to a traditional potato soup."
2.0,Did anyone else even come close to using 6 cups of flour? I used met before. And it came out perfectly
2.0,"I made this recipe today and I would have to say it’s nothing great. I did not add the potatoes and celery as these are not things I would typically expect in a “cheeseburger soup”, however I did add the carrots as it is nice to have some veggies in there. I also added macaroni so it wasn’t just liquid cheese I was eating. I guess I just hate American cheese, it’s very fake tasting and leaves a sticky coating in your mouth. I am going to try this recipe again with real cheddar and hopefully it comes out tastier."
2.0,"I made this with the flour tortillas and they were soggy, slimy and did not taste good.  We ended up dishing out the &#34;filling&#34; (which was good) and not eating the tortillas at all.  If I were to make this again, I would use tortilla chips instead."
2.0,"Tasted okay.  My family liked but next time, no thyme."
2.0,My husband did not like this and I would use corn tortillas instead of flour.
2.0,"I made this; added fresh spinach, green pepper, and mushrooms.  Used a swiss/gruyere cheese combo, and some cheddar.  It still was very bland, and I think that was due to the potatoes, which really need to be cooked first in order to have any flavor.  Otherwise, the potatoes just overpower everything else in it."
2.0,This recipe is to simplistic and not detailed enough. By not letting the yeast sit I believe it caused the bread not to rise high enough. This resulted in 2 loafs that were shorter than they should&#39;ve been. I also reccomend a egg wash before cooking. The texture of the bread was sorta like cornbread and a little mushy but not to bad really not great or terrible. it was very crumbly and hard to cut thin slices.
2.0,"I haven&#39;t made this yet, but plan on it. Does anyone know if I use olive oil if it will make a difference?"
2.0,Disappointing.  All you could taste was citrus!  :(  Not sure what I am going to do with the leftover chicken now as it wasn&#39;t enjoyed.
2.0,The result is exactly like a bacon-flavored block of cheese. Can not recommend.
2.0,I was disappointed. Easy to make but very bland even with hot sauce. I added bacon and still no flavor. .
2.0,"As I was making the soup, I was wondering why there was no garlic or onion? Looking at the spices, I only see salt and pepper. I just knew this soup was going to be bland, and I don&#39;t want to make something, and it not be great! I melted the butter and added garlic and onion. I also added crumbled bacon and cubed ham. I used red pepper flakes instead of the hot sauce. I also thicken the soup more, to get a more like a chowder consistensy. I chopped in some fresh parsley just before serving.  After my changes, I loved it"
2.0,Followed recipe to a tee. Broth was very very thin!!!  I used the chicken broth to boil veggies!!  ??? Might add some corn now..?? When I added broth
2.0,"The recipe was blend so I ate dried herbs, more salt, onion and garlic powder. After doing that it was amazing"
2.0,"I found this soup so bland and runny. I even used Pepper Jack instead of cheddar. I don&#39;t understand what all the raves were about. Not yummy, just boring."
2.0,"I thought the Italian dressing totally overpowered the casserole. I already have 4 wonderful enchilada casserole recipes (three of which I got from this website)...so I will be sticking with those. It would probably be ok without the Italian dressing, but I won&#39;t be trying it again."
2.0,"Very tasty, but the bottom tortilla was very hard.  I let it sit for 10 minutes before we cut it and it still oozed all over the place.  Did not turn out well....maybe my salsa was too watery, I&#39;m not sure, but we couldn&#39;t even save it for leftovers; it was too runny."
2.0,We didn&#39;t care for this at all.

2.0,Don’t use Granny Smith apples - pie came out perfectly except Granny’s make it sour!
2.0,"I was excited to try this recipe.  Followed it to the letter.  Bread didn&#39;t rise properly, the sides and bottom were burned and the middle was still mush.  I greased my pans really heavily so it would not stick.  Still stuck.  I&#39;m only giving this 2 stars because it was an easy recipe.  What a waste of ingredients. We couldn&#39;t even eat it."
2.0,"sounded good, but, sorry didn&#39;t care for it"
2.0,My family and I were not a fan of this recipe.  It was so thick with all the flour and we couldn&#39;t taste anything but thyme.  It was a bit salty as well.  The seasonings were just overpowering.   I think this would better suit my families tastes if the seasonings and flour were cut in half.
2.0,"With no offense meant to the creator of this recipe, I felt cheated!   With a name like Zucchini Pizza Casserole, I expected some pizza flavors.  I didn&#39;t get any of that at all!!!  It was tasty as made according to the recipe, but disappointing.  I kind of thought the zucchini layer on the bottom would be more like a crust, but it wasn&#39;t.  I will try this again, but I have some other ideas to ramp it up!"
2.0,"I thought the Italian dressing totally overpowered the casserole. I already have 4 wonderful enchilada casserole recipes (three of which I got from this website)...so I will be sticking with those. It would probably be ok without the Italian dressing, but I won&#39;t be trying it again."
2.0,"Too bland for my taste, even though I don&#39;t like spicy foods either.  I had a lot left over &amp; if I had served it again, intended to add a can of crushed tomatoes.  Instead, after a few days in the frig, I just threw it out.  It needed something - just not sure what."
2.0,Mine came out super liquidity and my apples were still crunchy. I have to bake it again. The flavor was okay.
2.0,We aren&#39;t super fans of Velveeta so it wasn&#39;t our favorite recipe. Fun to try though
2.0,Not sure what everyone was so impressed with. I made these and they were really dry. Maybe I just didn&#39;t add enough Zucchini but still I had to smother my cupcake in creamcheese frosting to eat it. To be fair I did not try the caramel frosting.
2.0,"It was okay, but to sweet for my taste."
3.0,"A pretty good recipe, but I thought it needed some help.  The mirepoix makes a real difference to the full flavor of the soup, but I did not care for their noticable presence in the finished product.  Solution, I pureed them once fully cooked with 1 cup of beef broth.  That is a second change I made, beef not chicken broth for all of the obvious reasons.  For me, a cheesebuger always includes sliced tomato, so that brought me to my third modification - 1 14 ounce can of diced tomatoes with juices.  My fourth change was to use a full pound of ground beef.  I also used the pan drippings to cook the mirepoix which contributes greatly to the meaty flavor of the soup.  To keep the cooked ground beef moist &amp; tender, I did not return it to the pot until the potatoes were almost done.  The mirepox puree eliminates the need for the roux to thicken the soup.  I used the combination of the puree and the starch from the cooked potatoes to create a creamy base for the soup as the cheese melted.  Rather than Velveeta, which contributes too much salt to the soup, I used 4 ounces of cream cheese and 12 ounces of sharp cheddar (use the cheese you best like on you cheeseburger).  The cream cheese also helps with the emulsification of the sauce, and made the sour cream unnecessary.  I finished with salt &amp; pepper to taste  along with a generous 1/2 teaspoon of dry mustard.  After all what is a cheeseburger without ketchup (the tomatoes) and mustard?  While I made a number of changes that I prefer to this soup, I would not have thought of a cheeseburger soup with out this for inspiration."
3.0,I liked it but my husband and son did not.  I think the three layers of tortillas made it hard to cut through and the leftovers were soggy.
3.0,"I made this pie, the taste was excellent but it was so runny.  I went back through recipe to see if I missed anything but I hadn&#39;t.  Any idea why.  The apples were soft but still in shape."
3.0,"It was okay. My husband really liked it but me and the kids didn&#39;t. I wont make it again but I must say, the Italian dressing went well in it."
3.0,"easy, like the ingredients, OK taste"
3.0,This was ok. It was not amazing and nothing really special. I may make it again and I may not. We all thought is was ok.
3.0,In my opinion this is not the best ever banana bread.  There is one in a Southern Living cookbook which is the best I have had.
3.0,This was pretty good. I do have one complaint though.  The bottom tortilla&#39;s were hard. I think next time I am going to put a really thin layer of salsa or something at the bottom so the shells will not be rock.
3.0,"It was okay. My husband really liked it but me and the kids didn&#39;t. I wont make it again but I must say, the Italian dressing went well in it."
3.0,My husband and I loved the taste of the pie but the texture was very runny.  Even after refridgerating overnight - it was still &#34;soupy&#34; and did not hold up when cut.  It didn&#39;t keep us from grabbing a spoon and devouring it though.....
3.0,This was okay.  It is very heavy and I won&#39;t make it again.  It tastes like a bowl of queso.
3.0,It was just okay.
3.0,I made this Key Lime Pie and it lacked some things.  Wish I had added some lime juice to it and maybe cream cheese or something.  It just did not have the tangy taste I like in lemon pies.
3.0,This was ok. It was not amazing and nothing really special. I may make it again and I may not. We all thought is was ok.
3.0,I&#39;m confused - in the description it says &#34;maybe it&#39;s the cream cheese&#34;.  I can&#39;t find and cream cheese listed in the ingredients.
3.0,"I was so looking forward to trying this recipe, but I must&#39;ve done something wrong. It did not turn out at all, and there were definitely no distinct layers, as shown in the photo. I&#39;m not sure what happened."
3.0,"I was so looking forward to trying this recipe, but I must&#39;ve done something wrong. It did not turn out at all, and there were definitely no distinct layers, as shown in the photo. I&#39;m not sure what happened."
3.0,"I really thought this was going to be better based on all the other reviews.  Maybe it was the kind of black beans I used or the type of Italian dressing, but my family didn&#39;t love it.  I may try this one again just because I love anything with tomatoes or cilantro."

3.0,"I gave this recipe three stars as 1) canola oil is so unhealthy.  I used organic coconut oil instead, plus about a tablespoon of butter.  2) I used 1/2 cup of sugar and used 3 large overripe bananas instead of two (I didn&#39;t measure but it was probably more than the 1 cup of bananas called for in the recipe). In addition, because of the extra banana, I was able to cut the eggs down to one but I did use  a large egg.I added 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 cup chocolate chips, as my family likes that, but they aren&#39;t necessary as I tasted the mixture before baking and it was plenty sweet.  I wasn&#39;t sure about baking it at 325 degrees...so halfway through I upped it to 350 degrees.  I don&#39;t think it made any difference...but I do have a convection oven."
3.0,"Just okay. Too much cheese, and I even added plenty of extra broth."
3.0,It was just okay.
3.0,Was a bit too fluffy--I prefer a more substantial pie.  But the taste was good.
3.0,"As written this has far too much sugar for my taste. . 1 C. Was plenty the 2nd time around,especially since I used 3 bananas that were black. Reducing the sugar and upping the banana by 1 gives far more banana flavor..  Black bananas are much sweeter, so no sweetness is lost.i think i will stick to my normal recipe. Sorry."
3.0,"I&#39;m gonna make this again, but DEFINITELY with adjustments. No celery! It&#39;s extremely distracting. I&#39;ll also be adding chopped pickles. I&#39;ve had another cheeseburger soup recipe that had them and it was DELICIOUS! Who knew, right?! Leave out the basil. It makes this taste like a spaghetti sauce gone wrong. Lastly, a whole pound of Velveeta? Really?! I&#39;d cut that to about 1/4 of that! Garnish with Cheddar if ya want more cheese."
3.0,This was pretty good. I do have one complaint though.  The bottom tortilla&#39;s were hard. I think next time I am going to put a really thin layer of salsa or something at the bottom so the shells will not be rock.
3.0,Use corn tortillas for a real enchilada texture. Flour tortillas get soggy.
3.0,I change out black beans for pinto beans and omitted the Clintro as we don&#39;t care for it.
3.0,"I used bread crumbs instead of oats b/c thats what I had in the pantry. I took aliciachapa&#39;s advice and baked it at 375 for another 25 min. I also added some bacon strips on top. It was good, but not amazing as other recipes Ive tried. Ill make it again when I need something fast"
3.0,"Made this last night for my husband and me. We both thought it was just OK. Way too cheesy. If I make it again I would definitely cut the cottage cheese in half as we felt it was overwhelming and cut back a bit on the other cheeses as well. Although the recipe calls for quite a bit of bacon we felt the dish could&#39;ve used more. Maybe next time I&#39;ll substitute chopped link sausages for more substance. Not sure the potatoes add much to the dish. But, overall, a good basic recipe that can be improved with a few tweaks so I&#39;m glad I tried it. Thanks for sharing."
3.0,"The thyme overpowered the taste of this pie, otherwise it should have been fine.  A lot of steps to have the one seasoning throw it off."
3.0,I just made this recipe again and some of it stuck to the glass pan. I just read a review that said to use shortening and not the spray. I will definitely do that next time. The card players should love this surprise treat. I would give it a 4 star rating this time.
3.0,"I was really excited about this, but after spending much time on it, I was disappointed as it seemed bland except for the fact that there was way too much of a thyme taste. Next time, I&#39;ll cut the thyme and add other seasonings."
3.0,Substituted cucumber for zucchini-works well/substituted 2/3 c Splenda Blend for sugar/not a moist cupcake/frosting required 3+ c confectioners sugar for spreading consistency-anything less would create glaze consistency
3.0,Do you need to let the yeast wake up before you start mixing in the remaining yeast?
3.0,"Just made these for dinner, made them exactly as the recipe states.  I was really disappointed with  them after reading all the great reviews.  They were bland and the amount of ingredients didn&#39;t seem proportional  to one pound of beef.  Out of 3 adults none of us liked it, I threw out the leftovers."
3.0,"This soup didn&#39;t remind me of a cheeseburger in any way shape or form.   The potatoes just didn&#39;t seem to belong.  I did like the cheesy broth and if I make it again, will leave out the potatoes and add either broccoli with bacon or macaroni."
3.0,Sorry but the recipe is wrong for those above Sea level....  Reason is not enough water which will evaporate the ratio should be 1 cup of water to 2 cups of flour per loaf of bread.  Oil can be higher ratio.   The bread when it rises will create its own heat.  SO if you have dry flower that is why... change the ratio of water to flower for number of loafs.
3.0,Good one
3.0,Cooking 1 pound of bacon and a medium onion together does not work. Onion burns before the bacon is crisp (on medium heat). Do them separately or start the bacon well before adding the onion!
3.0,Not sure what all the 5 star reviews are about. I was disappointed. My husband liked this because it was spicy. My kids and I did not. I had to make a second dinner for them after they begged not to eat it. It will give you lots of gas too!
3.0,"First, you have to like meatloaf."
3.0,"Finally, a recipe that doesn&#39;t have a lot of hot spices added to it.  I go to an Amish town in Missouri and enjoy food that has natural seasoning and taste without all the spices."
3.0,"I used bread crumbs instead of oats b/c thats what I had in the pantry. I took aliciachapa&#39;s advice and baked it at 375 for another 25 min. I also added some bacon strips on top. It was good, but not amazing as other recipes Ive tried. Ill make it again when I need something fast"
3.0,"This is not a review per se, but a question to those bakers that have made this bread, when I eat it the first day it is made, its very good, however, it gets terribly dry after the first cuts and then it just does not taste as flavorful as that first slice.  Within a day or so after being made it is dry and very sad tasting.  Does anyone else have this same thing happen? I love the the easiness of this recipe and hope there are some suggestions on how I might get the moist taste you get from some of the store bought white breads."
3.0,"I wanted very much to like this soup, but it is just too bland for my taste.  Even with adding more cheese and hot sauce, it is bland.  I think it definitely needs onion along with the carrots and celery."
3.0,Question: How does the baking instructions change after you freeze the pie?
3.0,The cook time at the top doesn&#39;t match the bottom. An additional 75 minutes was not built into my planning time!  I&#39;ll be eating at 10pm. Can&#39;t let you know how it is until then!Oh wait. I just reread this after reading several reviews and finding one that mentions time. That&#39;s the frozen pie option. Time to take it out of the oven!
3.0,"I have done it and I am not so happy, it has called a lot of butter and flour so it has strong flour taste and very rich."
3.0,"Okay , but probably won’t make again."
3.0,Recipe is good but the directions suck they lump three or four different steps into one step so you&#39;re constantly back and forth between ingredients and directions trying to remember where you&#39;re at
3.0,Does anyone proofread these recipes?  Direction 1 says to put ing. in a bowl then bring to a boil...
3.0,"I did think the soup was a little on the bland side, so I added some onion powder that that seemed to help.  I also added a bit more flour because I like a thicker soup and I thought this was on the thin side. I do have to say, it was very easy to make."
3.0,I was a bit disappointed because of the outstanding reviews.  The ingredients weren’t anything special and that is what I got.  My changes were that I precooked the cauliflower by roasting it  before adding it to the broth after the other vegetables were cooked.  I also used the Smokey hot sauce for more flavor.  I will be “doctoring” the leftovers as I serve it.
3.0,Not impressed. Meshy and salty from that amount of bacon.
3.0,I want my bread to look like the one in the picture.  Mine wasn&#39;t golden brown but I&#39;ll try it again.
3.0,"It was tasty, but WAY TOO SPICY.  I had to give it away because no one would eat it."
3.0,"I will make into a cake next time,delicious.."
3.0,"OK, I substituted the buttermilk with milk and a tablespoon of lemon juice (as directed in the ToH-cookbooks), but the muffins didn&#39;t puff up as they should and collapsed somewhat at the end (when still IN the oven). Very strange. Perhaps substituting buttermilk was not such a good idea. The taste however was OK."
3.0,Nice
3.0,This recipe was alright. I didn&#39;t add the cinnamon to the frosting and everyone loved the frosting. I will probably make the frosting again.
3.0,Good but not as amazing as I had hoped by the reviews.
3.0,These cupcakes were bland.  The frosting too sweet.  They taste more like muffins instead of cupcakes.
3.0,"For some reason i thought it said 3 cups flour. I was wondering why i had to double that. Aside from me reading directions wrong, its a fantasic basic recipe. I would say add a tiny bit of spice to the water before mixing.  I added a pinch of garlic salt, onion powder, and italian season and just wow! Such a small amount of spice can go a very long ways!"
3.0,"Why does the ingredient list say 6  cups of flour, but they only tell you to put 3 into the dough, (plus some extra).  I put in a little extra to make the dough not stick, but that was no where near 6 cups total!  I hope I&#39;m not making this bread all wrong!!  Please fix the directions!"
3.0,"Corrected review: A half cup of flour per pie was too much. It came out too gluey and dense. I started over, used a little less than a 1/4 cup per pie, and it turned out good. Thick enough to hold everything together but still creamy."
3.0,"This had great flavor but the mixture was too thick. It was like pasty gravy. May be just a personal preference that I like it more creamy. Therefore, I will definitely use less butter and flour next time."
3.0,"Made this for dinner tonight, and the &#34;gravy&#34; was super thick.  I wish I had stuck to my instincts and put about half the flour in it, or maybe used cornstarch instead.  Also, with adding the milk, it&#39;s more like a cream gravy, and I prefer a rich traditional chicken gravy.  Not terrible, but won&#39;t be a keeper for our house."
3.0,I was not a big fan.  It was easy to make but used more ingredients and was more expensive to make than another recipe I have.
3.0,"The caramel frosting is absolutely outstanding.  The cupcakes themselves, however, were just okay, and really tasted more like a muffin than a cupcake.  I have a chocolate cake with caramel frosting recipe that is really good, and I&#39;d make that in cupcake liners before I&#39;d ever make this again."
3.0,"I made some changes due to suggestions from other reviewers.  I used 9 eggs instead of 6.  I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese because I really dislike cottage cheese.  My potatoes were added frozen because I did not notice that the recipe said thawed.  The casserole was very, very dry.  I assume it was because I added too many eggs.  The flavor was good and I will try this recipe again only this time I will not make any changes to the original recipe."
3.0,It was alright.  My husband did not really like it but he liked that it kept him full for a long time.
3.0,"This recipe is ok, but I have another similar recipe we like much better. I think the hashed browns make this a little heavy."
3.0,"This recipe was easy to make and tasty, however I found it very bland. I was worried when preparing it that it would be, but wasn&#39;t sure if the saltiness of the bacon would be enough, so I didn&#39;t alter the recipe except to make it with 10 eggs. After eating it, I would definitely add salt and pepper, and maybe even some green and red peppers. It has the potential to be a wonderful recipe."
3.0,"Scale of 1-10:Ease of prep: 9, super easy, just toss in a bowl and mixCooking time: 8, it&#39;s about average for breadsTexture: 8, still a little fluffier than I like but the crust isn’t as flakyMoisture: 9, has enough that I didn&#39;t feel like a slice NEEDED some kind of spreadFlavor: 6, sweeter than I like, less sugar next time."
3.0,Reading all the 5 star reviews I thought this would be a slam dunk.  It was good but disappointing. Not what I expected.  I have another similar recipe that&#39;s the keeper so I will stick with that one.
3.0,"I&#39;m totally confused by everyone who loved this recipe. I halved it because I was making one pie. I found the 1/2 cup of flour way too much for thickening. I had to thin it using additional milk and broth which threw me off. I then needed additional salt and pepper. When I realized how thick my sauce was I looked at other recipes. For the amount of liquid I used, 1/3 cup of flour is appropriate. I&#39;m certain I measured correctly. My flour was all purpose. It was fine after the adjustment."
3.0,"Not sure how this received so many positive comments.  I made recipe as written and it resulted in a very thick and gummy sauce.   It is far too much flour in this recipe.  If I make it again, I&#39;ll cut flour in half."
3.0,"This tastes good but I greased the pan and the bread would not come out of pan, so I lost the entire bottom of the bread."
3.0,Was not to impressed with this recipe.All I could taste was the cream.
3.0,This sounds good but way too many fat calories from the cheese.
3.0,"The flavor of this chili is excellent. I would mention that it could have been a bit thicker, not so runny. And I used chicken thigh meat instead which made the bites of meat super tender."
3.0,Recipe is nice it taste great. But the filling is very liquidy and came out like soup even after cooking longer and resting for an hour. Was disappointed but taste great
3.0,"It was ok, i thought it was more of a potato and cheese soup versus a &#34;Cheeseburger Soup.&#34;"
3.0,"I think I was looking for something extra special in this soup, but it wasn&#39;t there--quite a bit of work for something that tasted merely average."
3.0,"Will not make this again.  It was good, but did not get fluffy like the picture, and did not get firm when refrigerated.  Maybe because I used regular Jello instead of sugar free?"
3.0,Loved the crust. Made it with brown sugar. The filling wasn&#39;t very tasty. Added lime juice which helped a little. Will add more next time I make it. My family loved it as is and ate all of it.
3.0,This had very little flavor &amp; too many green chilies.
3.0,.
3.0,Actually tastes even better the next day as a leftover
3.0,"This recipe is at least 15 years old (nothing wrong with that), from Weight Watchers.  It is very good, but I agree with the first reviewer.  Not a fan of Cool Whip, and I&#39;m not a fan of anything that is sugar free.  There are some funky ingredients in both Cool Whip and the sugar free Jello."
3.0,I couldn&#39;t wait to try this soup due to the rave reviews except that is from the nutrition police. It is a filling and tasty meal but I couldn&#39;t give it more than 3 stars. Because to us it was just average. I will probably make it again and maybe add more ground beef.
3.0,Soup tasted great but it tasted nothing like a cheeseburger.  More like a cheesey potato soup with hamburger added.
3.0,"Toss the apples with the lemon juice then the sugars to coat THEN cook in large skillet to start the cooking process and reduce the liquid. Med heat  toss frequent cover to cook apples, after 10 look at the liquid add the flour, table spoons at a time tossing as you go. If it’s tighten up take off heat  then add to ready pie shell  bake as before."
3.0,i saw that this was one of the best rated casseroles so it inspired me to try it. It wasn&#39;t anything to really rave about and I wouldn&#39;t make it again unless I added something like sausage. Maybe that would be better.  It tasted kind of bland to me. Needed some spices to taste like pizza
3.0,"My family was not crazy about this soup.  It had a comforting quality to it but was lacking in flavor or something.  None of us cold put our finger on what was missing.?  If I make not again, I will experiment a little."
3.0,"Great taste on this bread but I&#39;ve tried it a couple times and I&#39;m having the same issue as a previous reviewer .  The sides brown way to much, long before the loaf is done . I tried doubling the recipe and making 3 loaves to cut the cook time but still had the same problem ...maybe ill try muffins out of it next time ."
3.0,"Followed recipe exactly and first time using this recipe.  I was very disappointed in how it turned out - did not raise and edges burned even tho&#39; I thought it a good idea to loosely cover with foil once I saw the edges browning.  This was supposed to be a gift but could not in good conscience, give it to anyone.  Have not tasted it yet ....But in the future, will go back to my reliable stand-by recipe (which I thought was lost but have since found) as something is not quite right with this one."
3.0,"Way too much ginger and nutmeg in this recipe. I even had more apples than called for and it was overpowering. Cut back the cinnamon, and just add a pinch of the nutmeg and ginger. Let the apples be the hero."
3.0,My family loved this but I did make changes. I used bulk Italian sausage instead of ground beef and pizza sauce instead of tomato sauce. I don&#39;t think it would have tasted like pizza otherwise. The crust had to be baked longer than recommended and the zucchini needed more time in the colander to draw out the moisture. Knowing this now and making those changes I will be making it again.
3.0,"I think this sounds good but the pizza influence is not there, namely the seasonings in real pizza sauce. Basil, oregano. Garlic, salt and black pepper. A can of paste added to the sauce. Simmer until it bubbles like the old mud pots at Disneyland. Top the zucchini layer with sauce, top with hamburger, veg and cheese and that should bring this home. I’ve been making pizza for 50 years, trust me this works. Otherwise it’s a great recipe and the zucchini rocks! Love keto."
3.0,Which is it? 8 ounces of cheese or 2cups? Help?? Please.
3.0,Never liked the sound of this. Until i tried it. This recipe is a good starting point. I almost always change things to my taste. I have used leftover grilled cheeseburgers in this and the flavor that is added from the grilling was amazing! Also have used some smoked cheddar i had on hand. Or some spicy nacho cheese from a can. I garish with your regular burger toppings tomatoes pickles   A1 fried onions mushrooms. Great soup!
3.0,"My husband ate three bowlfuls &amp; indicated it was okay. I substituted 2 T. potato starch for the flour, used 1 1/2 T. Better Than Boullion Beef Base &amp; shredded cheddar cheese with half and half &amp; milk."
3.0,"Sorry but there are more delish way to pack on 18 grams of fat , and over 1/2 a days worth of sodinm  into  a singl  SERVING. Some sodium can be cut by reducing celery ( who knew it is l is loaded w/ sodium ??)  Velveta is tasty but most of fat and salt cone from here. I need to look further  for another recipe"
3.0,May I request the complete recipe for the double crust?
3.0,"Followed the recipe word for word.  I let the pie cool over night, but it was runny!!! The flavor was great though! Guess I should have listened to other reviews, and added extra flour."
3.0,"Not even close to the best banana bread.  I followed the recipe verbatim so I didn&#39;t add numerous additional ingredients and say I made the recipe.  As a matter of fact, I made a better loaf yesterday using a different recipe that was also called the best banana bread.  The recipe simply doesn&#39;t have enough bananas in it.  Its a nice bread but has limited banana flavor.  I would suggest looking for a different recipe."
3.0,I used mild Italian sausage as I can&#39;t get turkey sausage where we live.  We found it salty and lacking flavour.
3.0,"Absolutely lovely. Chicken fajitas are one of my all time favorite. BUT 30 grams of carbs is 2 days of carbs for me, so it&#39;s out of my eating range :("
3.0,I followed directions. It tastes very bland. Very disappointed.
3.0,"I marinated the chicken a full day and it seemed to be missing something. We happen to like a little more spice. I agree with other reviewers that it might be better with lime, but I didn&#39;t have any. . I probably won&#39;t use this recipe again."
3.0,i&#39;m confused.. i&#39;m trying to mkae this right now. it says 2 cups (8oz) velveeta. but there are 8oz in a cup. help!!
3.0,i&#39;m confused.. i&#39;m trying to mkae this right now. it says 2 cups (8oz) velveeta. but there are 8oz in a cup. help!!
3.0,"Not sure why, but my family didn&#39;t care for this that much."
3.0,"This recipe is a place to start.  Hard to imagine how boring it would be as written.  We roasted the vegetables.  Added sauteed onion and a list of seasonings; onion powder, basil, marjoram, white pepper, paprika and made it a little thicker and it was very good."
3.0,I am eating leftover soup and just realized what`s missing. It needs a pinch of dry mustard!
3.0,This was pretty bland. I had added 2 diced chicken breasts and extra black pepper &amp; even some Korean chili powder but that was not enough. What really helped was sprinkling some green onions over the top of the soup after serving.
3.0,"I am still in the process of making this so my star rating is not really fair. However, I am confused. I went out yesterday and carefully selected all of the ingredients. If you look at the ingredients list there is no mention of provolone; then when you get to step 3 you are supposed to layer with provolone. Provolone is similar to mozzarella, but the instructions call for provolone AND mozzarella. Note the recipe also calls for 1/2 c of Parmesan cheese. No where in the instructions is that ingredient mentioned. Finally, the sauce is to be simmered for one hour. Unless you want it burned, don&#39;t plan on that. It is very thick and I had to stop with nine minutes to go. Obviously this recipe was not kitchen-tested."
3.0,"I only give a 3 star because Italian food should not be HOT!!!Eliminated the red pepper flakes, thank you very much. Otherwise, simple, easy and good. Oh ya, used home grown tomatoes, cooked down."
3.0,"I was really excited when I saw this recipe because the seasonings made it look like it would be perfect (seasonings were very similar to Lawry&#39;s fajita mix which I think is very good).  Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed.  If I were to make it again, which I will not be doing, I would definitely add more green &amp; red peppers.  Probably a total of 3 peppers in all for the 1 1/2 pounds of chicken."
3.0,It was a little TOO CREAMY for me.
3.0,Very good ......I subtititued escarole for spinach...excellent
3.0,"I loved this recipe! I say “loved” because…something got changed. Can someone help me out? It was SO thick this time I made it,  and I hate ginger, so there definitely was none in there before whatever changes got put into this recipe… anybody have the original recipe from before? Cuz it was the best apple pie I’d ever had!"
3.0,Super salty. Next time I will not add the salt the recipe calls for and I&#39;ll also use &#34;no salt added&#34; tomato sauce and paste. I think minus the over salty taste this would be really good.
3.0,"It&#39;s still in the oven, but am I the only one who thought there wasn&#39;t enough meat mixture in one cup to cover the bottom of the 9x13 baking dish?"
3.0,Pat Milo try it with real mozzarella and ricotta.  cottage cheese cannot compare.  you can leave out the meat.  we like it without meat.
3.0,I was so excited about this recipe but my husband and I felt there was something missing.  We will try it again as a base but play around with the seasoning.  We thought the sour cream made it seem like Stroganoff soup so we&#39;ll leave that out next time.  
3.0,My wife made this last night.  She did substitute the white kidney beans for the great northern beans.  The flavor is excellent for the family and I was able to kick it up a notch with some habanero powder  at the table.  I found the chili to be a little thin for my liking and it would benefit greatly from a rest period to get some more of the flavor into the beans.

3.0,"For me, there wasn&#39;t enough seasoning - so I would double the salt and pepper and I&#39;m gonna try it with a clove or two of garlic next time. It could be because I omitted the onions, no one in my family likes them. But with a little change up this would be amazing - was still pretty good though."
3.0,I just did not think it had much flavor.
3.0,Very good recipe but not enough spice. Very bland....too many noodles left over and not enough ricotta sauce to fill last layer.... I don’t make lasagna so I followed the recipe exactly as it said....
4.0,"Delicious, If you like a mild chilli taste this is for you!😍 really would recommend making it!"
4.0,"The soup went over well with the family. The only changes I would make would be to use the full pound of hamburger and change the ratio of butter to flour to make the roux. The recipe&#39;s directions made a thick dry paste. I could actually taste the flour in the soup. So, when I make this again I will use 4 Tbsp of butter to 1/4 cup flour. I may need to tweek it a little so the roux is pourable instead of a lumpy paste."
4.0,I added a little relish...made it even more like a cheeseburger
4.0,I used Gluten Free All Purpose Flour to make it gluten free for my son. Also used 2% milk Velveeta.  It was delicious!  Very thick and filling.
4.0,This was great..and you don&#39;t feel terrible getting another piece!  I plan on making it again with other flavors.
4.0,It was decent. I think too much sugar for my taste
4.0,"Next time I&#39;ll leave out the Italian dressing - it gave it a sweetness that I felt was out of place. And I&#39;ll use more beef and less onion. Between the salsa and the whole onion... it was just about too much. but in general, a good recipe!"
4.0,This recipe is really good.  I changed it up a bit.  I used ground Venison and made my own Italian dressing.  I also doubled the recipe and used one can of black beans and one can of refried beans.  I disagree with most of the people on here about this recipe being fast and easy.  I started it at 5 and by the time I was done with all the chopping it was 7.  Definitely a weekend meal.
4.0,"I thought the flavor was good but it didn&#39;t end up looking like the picture. The next time I make it I will add more layers of tortillas so it has more consistency. Overall, a good, filling meal."
4.0,Quick and easy! Makes for a wonderful weeknight dinner when you have kids with sporting events or other things going on! I also like to add green chiles to spice it up a bit!

4.0,"Okay...this wasn&#39;t my favorite recipe ever, but it satisfied a major Mexican food craving tonight. I made it with corn tortillas, and the flavor was good. Worth making. I think I&#39;d prefer even a bit more cheese next time. Gooey is good."
4.0,Not only did I roast the bananas but the walnuts as well. I also added chocolate chips. Yummy recipe! I will make this one again and again! I freeze my buttermilk into ice cube trays. So it is always handy!
4.0,"Very nice texture and flavor. Takes a long, long time to cook; more than the usual banana bread recipe. The crust on the outside of the bread turned out a little thick, though I did not burn it. Will most likely make again and experiment with the baking temperature."
4.0,"I&#39;ve made this twice now, and will be making it again and again!  I use soft corn tortillas for a more authentic enchilada flavor and double the cheese.  The contrast of the cool lettuce, tomato, and cilantro topping is fantastic.  Be sure to use a very sharp knife to cut the casserole, as the bottom layer of tortillas can be a bit of a challenge to cut neatly."

4.0,"I love Mexican dishes, and it is often difficult to find ones that my wife will tolerate.  The cilantro and the subtle flavor of the dressing made this a meal that she will most likely let me make again.  A dollop of sour cream would have probably made it even better."

4.0,Turned out really well.  It is a wonderful dish.
4.0,I&#39;m giving 4 stars only because my bottom tortilla got too crispy to cut which made it messy. I also substituted pintos for the black beans. Great flavor but may try cutting tortillas into strips as Ceannze mentioned.
4.0,"Good recipe and easy to make. Next time, I will try throwing some jalapeños on top as well since we love spicy food."
4.0,"I&#39;ve made this twice. The first time I added the Italian dressing and it was terrible! Tonight I omitted the dressing and although it was much better, it was missing a little kick. Next time, I&#39;ll try hot salsa to see if that helps."
4.0,"I&#39;ve made this twice.  I think I used corn tortillas the first time and liked it better than with flour. I used about 1 1/2 cups of cheese instead of just 1 cup, and my family thought it needed more cheese. Next time I will use less cumin and will leave out the Italian dressing. Someone mentioned 3 layers of tortillas. I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s just 2 layers. I placed 1 tortilla in the middle and tore the others to make them fit. I ended up only using 5 tortillas."
4.0,"We liked this, and I did leave out the Italian dressing becsuse I could not think of a reason for putting those flavors in a Tex Mex dish. Also used refreid beans and pepper jack cheese instead of the mexican blend."
4.0,"Enjoyed this very much.  I left out the Italian dressing (I just forgot it, I think), and used small corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas. I thought it came out a bit dry, so I might add more salsa or some enchilada sauce next time.  The whole family scarfed it down!"
4.0,"Delish! Added retried beans, no Italian seasoning. Even my kids loved it. Will make again"
4.0,"Since it&#39;s the first time I made this, I followed directions exactly as written, made no modifications. It was good, but the Italian dressing clashed with the rest of the flavors and I didn&#39;t care for that bit. Will make again and omit dressing."
4.0,I used corn tortillas instead of flour.  Omitted the Italian dressing.  I also added a can of refried beans and stirred the sour cream in meat/bean mixture.
4.0,This was delicious and so quick and easy to make with simple ingredients.  This is a keeper!
4.0,"This recipe tasted great!  It was also really easy to make.  I did use 2 cups of the cheese instead of 1 because it just didn&#39;t seem like enough, even though that added a lot more calories.  Next time I might try saving the sour cream out and putting it on top."
4.0,"This had good flavor, but using flour tortillas made the layers too thick and hard to cut and eat. If I make it again, I will use corn tortillas."
4.0,Bottom layer hard to cut thru.  Overall good flavor.
4.0,I omit the Italian salad dressing.  Extra salsa used.  Used a can of refried beans as well as the black beans.  Good chance to get the extra vegetables/fiber my family needs.
4.0,We liked it.

4.0,"i made this recipe for a group of friends, although i did exclude the italian dressing and 1 cup of the salsa, but it was a very big hit. i made one casserole with lean ground beef and one with chicken i shredded, and was suprised to find the chicken went over better! (with all the exact same ingredients) It also cut very well after cooling with the excluded ingredients, not messy or sloppy at all! :)"

4.0,"Mine didn&#39;t come out NEAR as neat as the picture, and the bottom tortilla&#39;s didn&#39;t come out until I cleaned the pan, but I will make this again in a wider dish with tortillas on the side."

4.0,This was very good but a little runny.  Maybe if I drained the salsa it would have been thicker.  Also would swap out flour tortillas to corn.

4.0,"Great Recipe.  I also altered it as recommended by other users.  I only used 1/2c sugar as my banana&#39;s were really ripe.  I used three banana&#39;s and added 1tsp of cinnamon and used 1/4c of coconut oil instead.  My bread was done after 40min so keep your eye on it, as it does not take over an hour to bake.  Next time I might add baking powder, as mine didn&#39;t come out as high and fluffy as I would have liked it."

4.0,"The whole family loves this bread as a breakfast item or a midnight snack. Sliced a half inch thick,  toasted with a little butter it&#39;s heaven on a plate.I would have given 5 stars but I think 1.5 cups sugar is too much. Cut back on the pure cane a bit and this bread is a winner."
4.0,I took the suggestion of one of the readers and used a toffee bar instead of the nuts.  Wonderful flavor BUT even though the pan was sprayed the candy sunk to the bottom of it &amp; I mean it STUCK!  Most of it had to be soaked off.  Next time I will do it without the toffee bar.
4.0,"All in all, it&#39;s a good pie. The 5 stars deceived me though.  It&#39;s way, way, way too runny.  I should have read the reviews in addition checking the star rating.  So if you&#39;re getting ready to bake this pie, do NOT dump the coated apples onto the pie crust under any circumstances (unless you like apple pie soup)."
4.0,"This was a great recipe and really easy to make! I used granny smith apples. It was a little sweet but by reading other reviews, maybe I will add a little mor flour next time. Yum!"
4.0,"This was simple and easy to fix, my whole family loved it.  I will be making this a lot.  Thanks for a great recipe."
4.0,"We&#39;re not great fans of beans, so I put a small can of corn and a grated zucchini in the ground beef mixture instead. I didn&#39;t use the Italian dressing, and I used my own version of taco seasoning (with garlic powder, sweet smoked paprika, and ground cayenne pepper). I served lettuce, tomato and chopped onions, salsa, and plain yogurt on the side (makes it easier to reheat leftovers). We all really enjoyed it."
4.0,"This is my go to banana bread recipe, made the following changes.  Reduced sugar to 1/3 cup sugar, added 1/3 cup of brown sugar, 1/2 tea of baking powder.  Used melted coconut oil for canola oil.  My bread only took 45-50 minutes to bake at 325.  Due to nut allergies l don&#39;t add nuts."
4.0,This is such a family favorite that I no longer need to read the recipe!  It&#39;s a winner.

4.0,"When I took it out of the oven, I wasn&#39;t too excited with how dark the bread was and the fact that it caved in the center some.  Looking at the picture, I see that one caved in the center some as well.  I did add more flour because of our altitude, perhaps I needed to add a little more.  It is a very sweet bread and not the usual banana bread flavor that I prefer but my husband was very happy with it.  He commented several times that it was good bread.  I do like how moist it is.  The main thing to note is it&#39;s a &#34;sweet&#34; bread and despite the darkness of it when it comes from the oven and tastes fine and is moist."
4.0,turned out well
4.0,"Very good and easy. Had corn tortillas, so I made 3 layers."

4.0,"Apple pie is my husband&#39;s favourite, but I rarely make it. Yesterday I picked up a 2 pack Tenderflake crust, and made this for him. It went over well. I did omit the ginger (preference), but next time I&#39;d reduce the nutmeg a bit too.I found it a bit too sweet, but that may have been because I used Gala apples and they were quite sweet. I&#39;d like to try it with Granny Smith next time."
4.0,"Overall, I like the recipe, Like others, I think either a little extra flower or some cornstarch would be good to help soak up some of the juices. That might vary based on the top of apple.My crust turned out great! But even with 5 extra minutes, my apples still weren&#39;t tender enough. I used Honeycrisp and a few golden delicious. I wish now that I&#39;d either tried another reviewer&#39;s tip of covering the whole top with tin foil (so I could have baked it longer), or perhaps cooking the apples in a sauce pan for 5  minutes to give them a head start. P.S. I probably would have chosen Jonathans or Jonagolds if my store had them. :-/"
4.0,"My suggestion to stop runny juice...sprinkle 2-3 tablespoons of instant tapioca. Put some on bottom crust, some inbetween , and finish with a little on top. When juices are bubbling thru slits in top crust, tapioca will thicken this as it cools. Delicious!"
4.0,"Great! Like it says, it&#39;s pretty runny but I just put it in the fridge overnight and it was perfect!"
4.0,"I made this pie for my very first Thanksgiving with the in-laws. Luckily I tried the recipe out a week before thanksgiving. I made the first pie exactly like the recipe says to. It turned out very runny, but tasty nonetheless. I then made another pie with the suggestions of other reviewers. I upped the flour to 5Tbsp and used a little more brown sugar than granulated. I was also stumped on which apples to use. So I went to my local market and grabbed 2 of each they had. I ended up with Gala, HoneyCrisp, and Sweet Tango. OMG! This pie was absolutely splendid. Thank you to everyone who submits a review so newbies like myself can bake something as easy as Apple pie."
4.0,"Easy to follow recipe. Very easy prep, &amp; we baked a perfect home made apple pie. The entire house smelled wonderful! I highly recommend this recipe for the novice baker, along with accomplished bakers as well. We were very happy with the results.  We used a mixture of granny smith apples and fuji apples. It was beautiful,and tasted just as great! Highly recommend for anyone who wants to impress their family with a gorgeous, homemade pie. PS. It was just as good cold the next day, or even reheated in the microwave. I felt proud of our efforts. Sincerely, Mrs. Vance"
4.0,"I never thought to put ginger in my apple pie. Pumpkin pie, sure, but NEVER apple. Then this recipe came along and showed me another way. It&#39;s SO yummy! It seems like an insignificant amount, but the ginger really adds some zing!"
4.0,"Made this cake twice First time , we fond too sweet ( too much sugar) second time, wait better, as I put just i cup of sugar. did put a bet of coconut essence to give an extra taste, It is a very easy cake to make, and very good . ***** did not have butter milk, so I put yogurt .  A slice of it is now my husband favorite breakfast."
4.0,We need a  good substitute for the eggs!  Thanks
4.0,"Pretty good. Nothing fancy, but certainly tasty. I think next time I&#39;d go a little lighter on the cheese, add some extra zucchini/squash, and play around with some spices or a little more imaginative of a sauce. Also, I&#39;m having difficulty understanding where the similarity to Pizza is imagined to be.

All that said, I liked it. Plus, as a concept (i.e. Squash/egg/cheese based) it&#39;s a great way to use up the tons of summer squash from the garden."
4.0,I can&#39;t wait to try this.  Love zucchini and pizza.  This was good.  I think I&#39;ll use stewed tomatoes next time for more flavor.
4.0,"A great way to use zucchini! Really good tasting.  But our first question was, &#34;Where is the crust?&#34;  The casserole baked up nicely and looked good, but we couldn&#39;t find a crust!  My family said I should add noodles.  I might add more flour. I added cut up ham and black olives instead of the hamburger and peppers. Yummy flavor."
4.0,This was pretty good.  A great way to use up Zucchini as  there is always an abundance this time of year.  I did use Italian sausage because that is what I had on hand.  I&#39;ll definitely make again but think I will bake the zucchini &#34;crust&#34; a little longer so that it gets a little crispy.
4.0,This is a go to dish for me every summer especially with a garden full of fresh zucchini!  There is lots of flexibility with this recipe and you can add garlic to the ground beef and onion mixture and add in some Italian seasoning to the sauce mixture.  I have done it both ways and our family loves it including my 11 year old son!
4.0,Good way to work some veggies into our diet.
4.0,"This ain&#39;t pizza until you use a pizza crust... So, I did. Well, sort of. I placed a ready-made roll out pie crust over the top, increased the temp, and saved some of the cheese to sprinkle on top for the last few minutes of baking."
4.0,"Very good BUT ADD TO YOUR NOTES ,ABOUT CRUST : Z ucchini MUST BE squeezed VERY WELL...using SEVERAL double layers of paper towels, and repeat several times...Even after draining. Then &#34;crust&#34;  should be kinda thin ISH  BUT EVEN everywhere in pan. Or thicker parts do not crisp up well. THEN be sure to COOL crust completely, so that meat"
4.0,"Very tasty!! To those who thought it was too soggy/goopy, squeeze the zucchini in your fist to remove the extra liquid. We loved this."
4.0,"I made this today, and it was easy and delicious. I will definitely make it again."
4.0,"Great, but not extraordinary."
4.0,I left am earlier review and forgot to add that I halved the white and brown sugar.  My family and I have health issues so I had to tone the sugar down but it was soooooo good!  Thanks for sharing
4.0,This apple pie is has amazing flavor. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars was the fact it turned out a little soupy and the apples stayed really firm however because it tasted so good everyone loved it. Next time I make it I’m going to try cooking the apple mixture a little before putting it into pie shell to try to thicken it up a bit and soften apples a little. This recipe is definitely a keeper!
4.0,"I have been making this exact pie for many years but in my recipe I have 1/4 tsp cloves instead of ginger, which I do prefer. I like my pie mildly sweet so I only add 1/4 cup each of the sugars. I find the apples have a good amount of there own sugar, even Granny Smiths. I also blind bake my bottom crust, I find the crust doesn’t  become soggy this way. This is an excellent  recipe. Thx Maggie"
4.0,Very good and easy!  I used tofu for the hamburger!
4.0,"This dish was very tasty, my husband loved the dish. I added slices of pepperjack cheese to the topping. Will definitely make again."
4.0,"This is delicious but needs to be seasoned.  I added oregano, basil, salt and pepper.  I added a couple of cloves of garlic to the onion/hamburger blend while browning.  My anti-zucchini family really enjoyed it."
4.0,"My picky family liked this recipe.  I made it as written, except that I added minced garlic when browning the ground beef and also used pizza sauce instead of Italian tomato sauce. I may try some other options next time, like adding mushrooms."
4.0,"I cut in squares and took to a Potluck, it was a hit! My changes were I used 1/2 ground turkey and 1/2  pork sausage. Had eggplant in garden so grated in with zucchini. Will make again."
4.0,Easy to fix and great taste. I used pepperoni instead of ground beef to make more pizzalike. Family would have liked it more if had a firmer crust.
4.0,This was a great recipe to use up zucchini.  I would make this again.
4.0,I forgot to tell you that I added 1 C quick oatmeal and 1 C chopped walnuts to the reserved crust for the topping.
4.0,This was the second time I used this recipe. Thos time I used granny Smith&#39;s rather than red delicious and the pie came out much better since it wasn&#39;t overly sweet. The ginger also adds a nice touch.
4.0,Was pretty good but small tart apples! Was awesome! I love it!
4.0,"Really yummy, only complaint is that like other people, the pie had soooo much liquid in the bottom. No biggy though, i just poured the liquid out carefully. Next time I would use more flower of cook the apples a bit first. The taste is great though! I used a bit less ginger, just because I was afraid it would be too overpowering, and it turned out good. Will make again."
4.0,My husband loved this dish and was happy that there were leftovers for his lunch the next day.  After reading other reviews I was very careful to make sure I really got the moisture out of the zucchini and was glad I had.  This came out great.  I will definitely be making again and may follow some of the suggestions for other toppings like pepperoni or maybe even using the sausage in place of the ground beef.
4.0,"This wasn&#39;t bad, but I thought the green pepper overpowered everything and I like green pepper.   I used spaghetti sauce and added some garlic powder and fresh basal to the sauce.   I think I will try again, but will put mushrooms and black olives on top and skip the green peppers.   Definitely worth making again with some tweaking."
4.0,"My son didn&#39;t really like this, but I did.  Of course, he doesn&#39;t like lasagna (I can&#39;t explain it), so that may be part of it.  But I liked the zucchini...I might have to experiment with it a bit more..."
4.0,"Made this for dinner last night. It wasn&#39;t bad, but I wasn&#39;t blown away by it. I didn&#39;t really taste the zucchini, so it would be a good way to sneak some in on a veggie hater. Left off the green peppers &amp; topped mine with mushrooms &amp; black olives. I will probably make it again, but not often as there is a lot of cheese!"
4.0,I made this casserole just as wrtten and it was good. The next time I made it I used italian sausage instead of the ground beef and it was fantastic.
4.0,"When I first mentioned this to DH, his response was somewhat short of enthusiastic.   But his motto is &#34;I&#39;ll try anything once.&#34;  He absolutely raved about this dish.  After reading many of the reviews, I made sure that my zucchini was as dry as possible.  I didn&#39;t use salt, but squeezed the shredded zucchini through some linen towels and then lit it sit for about a half hour.  Then squeezed it through paper towels.  I really wanted a firm crust so baked it for 25 minutes rather than 20.  That timing was absolutely perfect; the edges were just starting to brown.  I added garlic, red pepper flakes and some dried oregano to the sauce, and sprinkled some fresh julienned basil on top of the casserole right before baking.  The ground beef was more prevalent a flavor than I had expected, and the zucchinie was less.  This is a great casserole in which to &#34;hide&#34; vegetables.  We&#39;d love to try it with Italian sausage instead of the ground beef, but unfortunately that would raise the fat content through the roof.  All and all, a yummy recipe."
4.0,"Very good!! The process of drainig the zucchini was long.  I drained it for 30 minutes, squeezed it and drained again for 30 minutes.  I then rolled it in a towel to make sure all the liquid was gone.  I used mild turkey sausage and added garlic and italian seasoning to the meat.  I will make this again but next time I will cook the zucchini longer until it is golden brown and starts to get crusty."
4.0,"I let my shredded &amp; salted zucchini sit for about 20 minutes, then squeezed as much of the liquid out as I could by handfuls since I felt I would be able to get more out that way. After I pressed it into the dish I used several paper towels to soak up excess liquid. After baking the zucchini was still a little &#34;liquidy&#34;, but not bad. I&#39;m wondering how it would be with 1 egg instead. With the 2 eggs it didn&#39;t seem to bind the zucchini, in fact it seems the cheese would do a good enough job.I used spaghetti sauce and added a little more garlic and a very small sprinkling of oregano and basil."
4.0,My son said that it tasted like my homemade pizza before he knew that there was zucchini in the crust. My family liked it. I will make it again.
4.0,Tasted great but was too mushy.
4.0,sweet and moist!  I will be making this again
4.0,Awesome way to use up all that zucchini!
4.0,Very good. My husband and toddler went back for seconds. Will try adding mushrooms to sauce next time.
4.0,"I cooked the green pepper with the beef and onion, plus some garlic.  Next time I&#39;m not using any salt, and I may try ground turkey."
4.0,Delicious and super easy to make
4.0,Yummy
4.0,"yummy!  I used frozen shredded zucchini and just drained the liquid.  I used ground turkey and red pepper, and even my picky son liked it!"
4.0,"We really enjoyed this. I was concerned about putting a whole green pepper on top of the cheese, so I put most of it in with the beef and onion to cook. I also added some italian seasoning and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes."
4.0,Was delicious.  Mine came out a little soggy but perhaps I didn&#39;t get all the moisture out of the zucchini.
4.0,"Great!  I think you could use italian sausage or ground turkey, and I would add more onions and more green peppers next time.  I will also use some reduced fat cheese to cut calories somewhat.  I also threw in somme fresh basil into the sauce, and will add even more next time."
4.0,I used yougart instead of buttermilk and spiced it up with nutmeg and cinnamon. Delicious n moist!
4.0,"This is my first time baking an apple pie and I used store-bought crust. I combined this recipe with a recipe from Martha Stewart and I used bits of both. I had heard about cornstarch being a great thickener instead of flour and I&#39;ve been experimenting with it lately. It&#39;s a great way to make sure it doesn&#39;t come out watery. I used extra sugar and just under 2 tablespoons of cornstarch. I didn&#39;t even need to use the entire thing (spices (sea salt, ginger, nutmeg,  cinnamon, white sugar)and cornstarch mixture) . I noticed a lot of complaining in the comments about undercooked apples so I cooked everything together first and the cornstarch did its job to create a thick sauce right from the get-go. It just finished baking so I&#39;m at the cooling stage now. I added milk, cream and sugar to my egg wash and used it on the bottom crust to help keep it from being soggy as well as Heating a baking sheet for it to cook on. I&#39;ll edit if I remember! Thanks for all the help from the comments! ??"
4.0,"Don&#39;t you just love the smell of pomposity in the morning?  :)  This recipe specifically states that it is American Lasagna. That differentiates it from Italian lasagna, but I have always found that rather than disparage a recipe because of your purist tastes, or dismissing it out of hand, try it.  Different people like different things.  I quite like both this version and the ones made in Italian kitchens.  You will find differences in recipes from your own Mario and Giada, and I&#39;m not sure I would rank either of them among the world class of chefs that you seem to suggest they are, Martin.  I would also note that some of the best cooking came from the kitchens of &#34;housewives&#34;.  Unbelievable."
4.0,"Real Chefs will tell you to try their recipe and feel free to take the recipe and put your own spin on it, using ingredients you like.   Martin you are out of line with your criticism. I have eaten a similar lasagna at the home of Italian friends.  How many times have you heard real chefs say traditional recipes will be different depending on the region of Italy it came from.  So why don&#39;t you learn to keep your opinions to yourself and comment on the recipe only if you made it.  Seeing your displeasure with the ingredients, I doubt that&#39;s going to happen.  So keep it to yourself.  Love your comment bldrblue!"
4.0,I so love the substitution of cottage cheese.  I much prefer it to ricotta as I think ricotta tastes kind of dry.  Great recipe
4.0,"I can&#39;t wait for Christmas! I will surely prepare this lasagna for dinner with the use of bentilia to substitute the noddles used  for healthier Christmas eve dinner, and of course to enjoy the dinner without hearing the kids complain."
4.0,My first time making lasagna. I followed the recipe except I used store bought spaghetti sauce. My family really enjoyed this dish.
4.0,"This is a very good recipe but I&#39;ve now  made it several times with and without the sausage and we think it&#39;s better without the sausage since it&#39;s less greasy. I just add a little of the traditional, sausage spices to the grind beef and increase the ground beef (lean) proportionately. We make it about nice a month these day, sometimes more often in winter."
4.0,"Made this for the first time tonight and loved it with a few changes.  Made the meat my own way; adding onions, peppers and garlic to the meat and sausage mix and instead of tomato sauce and paste, I used a large  jar of my favorite spaghetti sauce, which cut down the prep time.  The rest I followed exactly.  I let it rest for about 1 hour, before cutting into it and just reheated pieces in the microwave.  This was a real hit at my home and I had plenty left over for the next day.  Definitely will be making this again and may try adding hard boiled eggs to the meat this time."
4.0,Haven&#39;t tried yet
4.0,Very tasty!  Lots of flavor and I only marinated about an hour.
4.0,"IT WAS SO GOOD, MY HUSBAND LOVE IT, TOO.MRS. SANDRA ELENA SMITH"
4.0,I make these all the time but made a few changes from the first time I made them. I felt they were a little bland so I revamped the seasoning to 2 tsp of cumin and 2 tsp of garlic powder and replaced the green onions with sliced red onions and 2 peppers  the color of the peppers depends on what I have on hand.Try yellow and orange peppers too. If you want to get rid of the after eating peppers burps try this: After slicing your peppers in strips soak in water for a few minutes and then drying your peppers with a paper towel. Then cooking. I can almost guarantee you won&#39;t be burping peppers all night.
4.0,I added some rice and avacado to my fajita it was delicious.
4.0,"Very good, but I decreased the amount of seasoned salt to 1/2 tsp (the 2nd time I made them) and the recipe turned out A LOT better!!!"
4.0,"My picky husband rated this an 8 out of 10, and this says a lot! Based on the reviews, I added a can of diced tomatoes with its juice; it was perfect!"
4.0,DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO COOK THE LASAGNA NOODLES !  THEY TURN OUT JUST FINE....
4.0,"I liked this recipe and would have given it a 5-star rating, but the meat sauce was too dry. I added a cup of beef broth during the last half hour and it was fine."
4.0,my kids like this better than reg. red bean chili....
4.0,my kids like this better than reg. red bean chili....
4.0,Easy to fix. The sauce had good flavor.
4.0,I&#39;m making it right now :D
4.0,"I followed recipe exactly and it was very good, but I definitely will cut back on the garlic next time."
4.0,"good recipe-but to saucy for me, next time will cut sauce back"
4.0,Just made this tasty soup with the addition of dijon mustard and a small potato - very satisfying with warm crusty bread.
4.0,"For those who like a very sweet banana bread this is excellent.  The only difference between this recipe and the one I&#39;ve been making for years, is my recipe calls for 1/2 cup sugar &amp; still excellent---just less sweet."
4.0,"The flavor is excellent but like others, i must say that I coud not get the center done which is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. I agree with the person who suggested baking it in two smaller loaves.  The crusty top is a real plus."
4.0,"These were really good.  I had a few options for everyone.  They chose a tortilla, tortilla chips or rice to spoon this mixture over.  Great either way!"
4.0,"We don&#39;t eat much mexican food, but I tried this recipe.  It was quite good.  I used olive oil instead of the oil listed and eliminated the cumin, chile powder and red pepper flakes.  I would make this again.  Thanks."
4.0,"We did enjoy the fajitas, but I like it better with lime as opposed to lemon and I add a sauce for a little extra zip."
4.0,Very very good. I added half cream and half milk instead of just the milk a bit more pepper and used medium white cheddar and half a medium onion very very small chopped. This is now one of my favorites. Thank-you. JP
4.0,I thought this was good.  I added about a half of a vidallia onion finely chopped to the dutch oven with a couple of Tbls. of butter and let that cook for a few minutes before adding the rest of the veggies.  I let the veggies cook for a few more minutes tossing them together and adding salt and pepper before adding chicken broth (21/2 cups instead of water and omitting the boullion).  I then made the cheese sauce adding fresh nutmeg and then added the cheese sauce to the vegetables.  I did not add the hot sauce .
4.0,Good recipe.  You need to add onion to your ingredient list and sauté the vegetables in butter first and then follow the rest of your recipe as written. Also just a pinch of nutmeg will really enhance the flavour.
4.0,"I liked this recipe as is but I agree with a couple of the comments, especially the one about the soup being bland as written.  So I  made some slight modifications second time around which prospective cooks may want to consider.  I added a lot more carrots and celery, around 1 cup of each plus two large finely diced garlic cloves. I found the carrots and cauliflower cooked much faster than the celery the first time I made it so next time I added the celery to the soup base 3 minutes before adding the carrots and cauliflower. I also added some cumin to the bechamel sauce. i do like some kick to my soups so I added hot pepper sauce as directed the first time.  I used red pepper flakes second time as I thought the Tabasco Sauce turned the soup a bit too orange. I like the suggestion to add some chopped onions as well. I will try that next time just to keep tweaking the basic recipe,as apparently that is what I do!"
4.0,"Great basic recipe. I added 2 teaspoons Tuscan seasoning, onion, more celery, more carrot, minced garlic, and more chopped celery. Yum!"
4.0,Very good soup.  I added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg because that&#39;s what I do...to cauliflower soup.  I also used store brand EXTRA sharp Cheddar Cheese.  Told once to always use extra sharp Cheddar ...to get more taste for the buck!
4.0,"Made this last night. Very easy. Made it substituting 2 1/2 cups of low sodium chicken broth for the water and bouillon. And served it with hot pepper sauce on side. A great basic recipe, but definitely needed the hot pepper sauce as it was bland. Will make again but definitely with adjustments to up seasoning. Thanks Debbie"
4.0,"I love this recipe.  However, to make it gluten free, I do not add the milk, butter or flour.  Instead, I just leave a couple of large pieces of cauliflower, then when it is done, I remove the large pieces and put them in the blender then add it back to the soup. Voila, cream soup without the gluten.  I do add some salt and garlic, as well.  I think it is delicious."
4.0,I  like this recipe.  I followed the recipe as stated except I added 2 1/2 cups of vegetable broth instead of  bouillon and 2 1/2 cups of water.  The broth was pretty thin so I added 4 additional tablespoons of flower  mixed it with the broth and added back into the soup.  That thickened it up.  The taste was a little bland but still good.  Next time I may add green chillies!  Will make again.
4.0,I made this with almond milk
4.0,"Pretty good! I doubled it and added chopped onion, because a soup without onion seemed weird, and extra cheese. I also added some freshly grated parmesan and romano cheeses, Lawry&#39;s garlic salt and Tony Chachere&#39;s creole seasoning instead of the hot sauce. I omitted the salt and pepper from the roux and added to taste after I combined the cheese sauce to the vegetables. I would&#39;ve gave it 2.5 to a 3 without my tweaks. I will use this recipe again for broccoli cheese soup."
4.0,"I made a half recipe for taste testing and thought it was very good.  I will make it again, but the half recipe only yielded 2 1/2 cups of soup.  I did not see where anyone else questioned the quantity.  I track all the nutritional data in recipes and this makes it difficult to accept the portions and calorie count shown for the recipe.   I double-checked the amount of the ingredients and found I was accurate with that.  Anyone else find it does not make the quantity stated?"
4.0,"This is an excellent recipe, especially if you&#39;re a beginner. It tastes way better than buying them ready made. I would however suggest only making this if you&#39;re used to spicy food because the amount of chili in this recipe is far more than regular taste buds can handle so If you&#39;re thinking about following this recipe you should half the amount of chili you use . But for the rest this recipe is perfect!!"
4.0,"I really enjoyed this recipe, my husband told me to remember this one."
4.0,EXCELLENT - Use for company
4.0,"Family really liked these, but I&#39;m not a fajita fan, so it only gets four stars."
4.0,"Easy and yummy. My son and I really liked it, but it didn&#39;t win over my husband who doesn&#39;t care for cauliflower most of the time."
4.0,"Good stuff, even people who are afraid to eat cauliflower will like this, if they have guts."
4.0,"I used ham pieces in broth that I simmered from leftover baked ham bone, instead of a chicken base because I had it on hand. We like cauliflower and ham so I thought it would be good. It was."
4.0,"I tried this recipe for the first time today.  Have to say that there seemed to be toolittle seasoning involved so I used my go to combo of onion powder, white pepper and sea salt.  I literally use these seasonings in every savory dish.  Also added parsley and basil flakes.  I didn&#39;t have shredded cheddar so I used six cheese Italian shredded cheese that I did have.  This soup will move into my personal line up.  The hubby is the soup king here but this one is mine. We both loved it."
4.0,"I have made this soup twice now. Love the flavours! I do find that it is a bit thin for a creamy soup. I tried pureeing some of the cauliflower and adding it back in, but I think next time I make it I will try reducing the amount of water used to cook the vegetables. Overall a yummy soup recipe!"
4.0,I don&#39;t have vegetable bullion. How much vegetable broth should I use?
4.0,"One more blue ribbon for this recipe. It won my chili cookoff at work, beating out 11 variations of red chili.  THe only thing I did differently was not to rinse and drain the beans, halved the onions, and added a 1/2 teaspoon of Yoder&#39;s Habanero sauce (from Shipshewana, IN) at the very end with the cream."
4.0,"Tasty Comfort Food .  Substantial meal for a cold day.  My husband loved it.   The prep time is not accurate if you peal and cut your own potatoes, onions and carrots, count on prep time of  at least  1 1/2  hours.   If you buy a rotisserie chicken from Costco or another store , you   need to buy two chickens   for this recipe.  This recipe makes 2 LARGE pies.  It&#39;s enough, supposedly, to feed 16 people, but realistically 2 pies will feed about 8-10 adults because you will eat more than an eighth of a pie!  We are average adults and the two of us ate a half of a pie... it&#39;s so heavy that you will not need anything else other than the pie for dinner.   The diced potatoes get  &#34;lost&#34; in the pie- maybe I should cut them in larger pieces next time.    This would be a great hit for a pot luck."
4.0,"Delicious   A fair amount of prep work, but the  results are worth it. Thick, creamy, flavorful"
4.0,This was a great dish! I didn&#39;t have any milk so I used cream of chicken instead. It made the filling very think but it tasted fantastic.
4.0,"This was pretty good! My 1st attempt at making a chicken pot pie and it turned out. It was very easy to make too, so that was nice. I will make a few changes next time and see how it goes. I&#39;ll probably do less Thyme and will try homemade crust but all in all...very good recipe. Will be making again!"
4.0,"My tongue is still tingling from my first piece, fresh out of the oven. HOT and yummy!Pros- moist and baked through. I was really worried about putting it all in one pan, because I hate partially cooked banana bread. This was banana bread, not pudding, and I liked very much. Great flavor.  However, I did cut back on the sugar (only 3/4 cup brown and 1/4 cup white) and substituted applesauce for oil. Didn&#39;t have buttermilk onhand so I just used milk and put some butter in for flavor. My dd and I are more than happy with the result.Raised up to a beautiful loaf of bread.  I don&#39;t know if it helped that I whisked the banana and egg mixture with an electric beater to be sure I didn&#39;t have banana globs. I will continue to do that.Cons- considering how sweet it is, I would not follow the recipe sugar recommendation.Bake time for my loaf was too long, and I only had it in for 50 minutes. I was glad it was baked through, but if this had been for gifts, I would not have shared.  The ends will be way too tough and overdone. It is very tough about a half to an inch around. If I would have gone the full 1 hr 20 minutes it would have been like a gummy bear.Overall, love it.  Going back for my second slice now!"
4.0,Great recipe but for our family I will omit the thyme next time. I did increase the broth by 1 cup to make it creamier.
4.0,"I followed the amounts given and could have made 3 pies!  Next time, I will not add the potatoes - just a personal flavor choice.  And I suggest allowing the filling to cool before adding the top crust.  Looking  forward to trying this with other poultry and veggie combos."
4.0,Very tasty and filling.  Great way to use up leftover chicken.  I used evaporated skim milk for the milk which gave it an extra creamy taste without adding any more fat and I used fresh thyme and a heavy sprinkle of poultry seasoning.  I made four deep dish individual pies and I could only eat half of one.
4.0,"My family did not care for it the first time I made it because of the thyme, one whole pie went to waste Made it again without the thyme, loved it, no leftovers this time. Loved the ease of the refrigerated pie crust."
4.0,"When I want to make Chicken Pot Pie, this is the recipe I turn to.  I have thought about reducing the butter a touch to cut down on the fat-that&#39;s why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5-it seems like a bit too much butter in the filling."
4.0,This potpie would have been delicious but I thought it had way too much thyme. I will try again with only a smidgeon of thyme.
4.0,I&#39;m not really a fan of banana bread but I had all the ingredients so I tried this one. It&#39;s amazing! Does anyone know if it freezes well? I&#39;d like to keep a few loaves on hand.
4.0,"Tasty, based on the other reviews used less flour and increased the spices a little."
4.0,"I loved this recipe ; however, cut the salt and pepper in half or at least I did; otherwise it would be too salty.Also, I have an electric oven and at 425 degrees, it only took 25 mins to bake. The amt of thyme was fine; my husband loved it and had two helpings.  I didn&#39;t think it was too thick at all; it was perfect because you added a lot of liquid ingredients ( milk and chicken broth and butter)I didn&#39;t rate it a &#34;5&#34; only because the salt and pepper was way too much; definitely have to cut it in half. Otherwise it was excellent. Bon Appetit!!!!"
4.0,"I made this pot pie for dinner, very good. I cut the recipe I half. Came out great. The next time I make it I&#39;ll make a looser  gravy since we like lots of gravy in ours."
4.0,Yum! Great chicken pot pie recipe. Made my own homemade crust - recipe on Allrecipes  (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/12492/pie-crust-iv/). Great consistency. Would add a little more spices.
4.0,Would like to make for concession stand food.  Can I use biscuits instead?
4.0,I made this for dinner tonight and everyone enjoyed it.  The sauce was so good; what I liked most is that it didn&#39;t required canned soup.  I used my own chicken broth and next time I will make my own crust.  I prefer to cook from scratch and not used processed food.  So good and perfect for a chilly night.
4.0,"Very easy to follow and truly fantastic.   Go easy on the thyme, maybe just bake the chicken with rosemary and thyme and not stick it directly into the roux. and don&#39;t dice the potatoes too small or they kind of turn into a mash when baked."
4.0,"One more blue ribbon for this recipe. It won my chili cookoff at work, beating out 11 variations of red chili.  THe only thing I did differently was not to rinse and drain the beans, halved the onions, and added a 1/2 teaspoon of Yoder&#39;s Habanero sauce (from Shipshewana, IN) at the very end with the cream."
4.0,"Tasty, but a bit bland.  I think that I would add some onion to this recipe."
4.0,"Love the texture of this soup.  Its rich, thick and  chunky . Most comforting. I did make a few changes and exchanges. I added garlic and onions. I also replaced some of the water for white wine and right before serving added a pinch of Nutmeg *JanieTaste of Home Volunteer FE"
4.0,"I had a nice sized cauli which I prepared, some skim milk, some heavy cream, but no other veggies, so instead of celery and carrots I added a can of mixed veggies, used 1 cup milk, and one of cream, plus 3/4 cup Kraft shredded Pepper Jack.  It was a most delish soup and I will enjoy it often this winter!  The pepper jack was a real winner."
4.0,"I thought the flavor of this soup was very good. I will make again but next time I will cut the water by 1/2 cup, I thought soup was too thin."
4.0,"Good but a little bland, as is.  I added sauteed onions and garlic, with a splash of Sherry and a pinch of nutmeg.  Now excellent."
4.0,"I&#39;m not sure how thick the soup is supposed to be, but it does seem to be thin. I added red onion, kale and a pinch of cayenne pepper.I&#39;m taking it to work for a lunch. Hope everyone that tries it, likes it."
4.0,"Very hearty, chunky soup. I made it as stated but used a cup of veggie stock and added a half onion. It came out very thick, had to add a little extra milk. It&#39;s a great and easy recipe but as others have said, bland. I added extra salt but still kind of lacked something and I didn&#39;t want to be pouring the salt in. Still great and I can&#39;t wait to make again with some herbs and with broccoli too. Thanks."
4.0,This was very good and very easy.  I added frozen pea&#39;s I had on hand after tasting it and that made it even better.   I also thought it needed more salt and would like to try it with garlic like others have said next time I make it.  But over all very good my husband even liked it but he said could we add some bacon he&#39;s a meat person.
4.0,What happened to the BACON???? LOL!!!
4.0,What can you substitute for the bouillon cubes?  Too much sodium for me.  Could I use chicken or vegetable broth?   this sounds so good.
4.0,"This recipe is really yummy.  I substituted water chestnuts for the celery and it adds a nice crunch to the soup.  I definitely added the hot sauce and I thought it would have tasted bland without it.  Also, nice to have a cream soup without cream!  Rather healthy."
4.0,"I made this, delicious but gets dry pretty fast and crumbles.
I will try adding an extra Tbls of oil"
4.0,"I cut the recipe in half, but forgot to cut the spices in half. Because of that- this had a LOT of bite!! Also used white kidney beans as we can&#39;t get great northern beans where I live. Next time, when I make it properly, I think I will still cut back on the cumin and cayenne pepper."

4.0,Delicious but part of one loaf was kind of doughy. Could be my oven it’s new and we have yet to figure it out.
4.0,"Being from a state where Beef is what&#39;s for dinner, my initial reaction to this recipe was less than excitement, but the reviews convinced me to give it a try.  We really liked it a lot.  I had to thicken it up a little with some cornstarch to suit my chili tastes.  Next time I make it, I will add a vegetable like cabbage or corn to increase the textural diversity but overall this is a really good chili and I will make it again."

4.0,"So this is a great recipe for ingredients but terrible directions and video. I used the recipe as stated (except I didn’t need quite as much flour) but followed mixing, kneading, rising, and shaping instructions from YouTuber “bake with Jack”. Seriously, do yourself a favor and watch his yeasted bread tutorial then make this following his directions. You won’t regret it. I’ve made bread before but it’s never turned out as good as after I used his instructions with this recipe. The combo will reward you with amazing delicious bread every time. Happy baking!"
4.0,"Very, very good, but not the best I&#39;ve ever made."
4.0,The first time I made this for my mom and she loved it. My brother had some and loved it too.  I just made some for myself and I added half a pack of banana cream pudding mix to make it even more moist and smooth.  I love my revised version.
4.0,"I&#39;ve made this recipe twice now, both times as freezer meals for expecting mamas.  If you don&#39;t like the way the filling tastes after you&#39;ve added broth and milk, add spices (salt, pepper, sage, garlic, onion, etc).  NOTE: This recipe makes a LOT of filling -- so use a large saucepan with high sides to cook, and have three pie shells ready, just in case.  This recipe always turns into three pot pies for me. :)"
4.0,This was very good. I only used half of the thyme and made my own crust. Delicious. I used low sodium broth and no added salt.
4.0,good quality recipe and bread :) thank you.
4.0,Am I understanding that I am supposed to let the dough rise twice as the directions say in step 2 and also in step 3? So far this has been a very simple and easy recipe to follow for this first time bread baker.
4.0,"Good, basic white bread. I bake a lot of fancy breads and thought I would give this a go and it came out fine. I also made it out of a pan and just did two free standing loaves. It had a nice crust and the bread itself had a nice &#39;sopping up&#39; power with my tomato based sauce. It was a little heavier than store bought, mass produced, &#39;half-baked&#39; store bought garbage, but that is obviously to be expected. We went through both in less than 2 days. I&#39;d make it again.   For those having issues, following directions is key. Use bread flour. Be patient. Put away your bread machine. Temp your water. Let the starter work. Don&#39;t use too much flour....only what it needs. (You probably won&#39;t need all 6 cups) If this isn&#39;t taking you a good 3-4 hours to make, you&#39;re doing it wrong."
4.0,"I am a Baker by trade, but when I&#39;m home I like to use this very simple recipe. I do use an egg wash and I reccomend a very light sprinkling of flakey salt. It is delicious and beautiful."
4.0,"Bread turned out great, could I use honey to sweetin and result"
4.0,"Bread tastes really good, and it was fairly simple to make, but it crumbles a bit and was hard to make into sliced bread. It didn&#39;t rise as well as I would have liked."
4.0,"New at this homemade bread thing, enjoying it very much but this recipe has been the best by far, texture was awesome, best that I&#39;ve made, i save this recipe on my phone instead of trying to find it again, and plenty of thumbs up from everyone"
4.0,"I made this bread 2 different times. Once I didn’t realize that my yeast was no longer active and ended up with a very dose loaf; but my kids still loved it. Even I did! Then I made the second round with an active yeast and it was much better. My youngest, while having his first couple bites, send to me, “Mom... this is the BEST bread.. seriously.. oh my gosh... you should be a chef!!!” Hahahaha.. I totally took credit too lol. Thanks for this easy recipe. Definitely a winner around my place!"
4.0,Recipe reads simple; the recipe is easy to understand.  Does the recipe go well with a bread machine?
4.0,"Old yeast isn&#39;t necessarily dead.  I&#39;ve used rapid rise yeast that&#39;s close to 8 months beyond the expiration date and it worked perfectly.  However, if the yeast was stored in a warm area either in your home or in a warehouse somewhere along the line, that could kill it long before the expiration date.  Dissolving it in water that&#39;s too hot will do it in too.  Best to have the water 105? to 110?.  If you set it  out to rise is in a cold room, that will prevent any rising.  I warm the oven a bit before I start and turn it off after a minute or so when it&#39;s around 100?.  That seems to work well for rising.  If the dough doesn&#39;t rise even after it&#39;s set in the oven to bake, then the yeast was dead."
4.0,I keep yeast in the freezer and use as needed.  I&#39;m using yeast from my freezer now that is over five years old.  Still very active.
4.0,I thought this was very good.  The only issue I have is the amount of thyme listed in the recipe.  I didn’t even use 1 full tsp and it was still very overpowering.  Next time I’ll use 1/4 tsp if any at all.  I also made it in a 10x13 baking dish (instead of two round pies) which worked very well.  Would definitely recommend - just use less thyme.  ??
4.0,For those that had an overwhelming thyme taste use dried thyme LEAVES .....NOT ground thyme. Fresh thyme works best in my opinion..... especially if you can find lemon thyme. (It is easy to grow too. Best in 12x12 x12  inches deep pots and potting soil. Use started  small plants rather than seeds. So easy and cheaper in the long runI like to add the juice of one lemon in this as well. The only way to make this even better is to have some homemade stock on hand. I save and freeze all chicken bones in a bag in freezer. 
4.0,"okay -- did not have everything and needed something quicker but used as a starting point!  Made half the recipe and wanted to reduce time by dicing up 1 cup of small new potatoes from a can for starters..  added about a cup of fresh mushrooms diced up along with onions  to saute in butter.  Substituted 12 oz package of mixed veggies for all other veggies -- will use more next time.  Used over-flowing 2 cups of rotisserie chicken along with &#34;jell&#34; from drippings in container.  Mixed everything together along with 1/2 cup of sour cream and placed in 11x7 casserole dish and topped with Parmesan cheese and then small cut-outs from pie crust.  Oh, used Thyme &#34;leaves&#34; and it was all wonderful!  I will definitely be making this again -- and probably in the very near future!"
4.0,"Really yummy, and easy to make. I&#39;d recommend halving the salt though."
4.0,I love this bread. Eady to make and wonderful.
4.0,"I make this quite often and every time I do, even folks (like my mother) who swear they don&#39;t like chicken chili, love it.  I think it is absolutely perfect, the only change I make is using fresh garlic and toasting and grinding my own cumin seeds.  Love Love Love this."
4.0,My husband doesn&#39;t like lots of beans so I only added one can of beans. In exchange I added a can of drained corn. I also added 1/2 c. sour cream and 1/2 c. plain lowfat yogurt. I also added 3 green onions. It turned out great.
4.0,Omg! I made this bread for my fist time to make bread and it was ausome. Thank you for letting me use the recipe. I&#39;ll use it many more times. Thanks Again D from Texas
4.0,I love how easy it is to follow.  Too bad I didn&#39;t follow it:( I forgot to put the oil in.  Didn&#39;t even clue in until I was reviewing cook times!  We shall see.  I will re-review once I&#39;ve tried it.
4.0,Thanks
4.0,"I modified this recipe for the slow cooker.  I used about 2 cups of COOKED, shredded chicken (and omitted the oil).  I then added all the other ingredients, except the creams to the slow cooker.  I also added an extra 2 cans of beans.  I slow cooked on low for 6-7 hours and then added the creams about 30 min-1 hour before serving.  It was delicious and I was very happy with the way i turned out in the crock! I have added it to my &#34;will make again&#34; recipe collection!"
4.0,"Not as creamy as the picture...more like a soup, but delicious!"
4.0,"Very easy. I think there&#39;s a bit too much sugar though. It could do with, maybe, one tablespoon less."
4.0,"This is one tasty pot pie recipe, it&#39;s definitely a keeper in my household. I believe in trying a recipe as written first and making adjustments later if needed, so that&#39;s what I did. Many have said it&#39;s very thick as written and I have to agree. It tasted great but was overly thick for my liking. The second time around I used a 1/2 cup of flour and for me, that was the perfect amount."
4.0,lord hammercy ... this pie was a back breaker for me ... i had to keep thinning out the mixture with more chicken broth than anticipated ... but i finally got there ... thanks for a very tasty pie ... this recipe rocks ... will def make again !!!
4.0,"I made some adjustments. Firstly, I cut the recipe in half. I cooked the potatoes and carrots in three cups water   three cubes of chicken bouillon, stained the broth to use it in the roux. I used three cups of chicken broth   3/4 cups 2% milk, and between 1/2-2/3 cups heavy cream. The sauce was perfect with the extra liquid. My husband and I absolutely loved it."
4.0,"I have been working on adjusting a similar recipe for years and for my tribe here are the only changes I make.  On the 1.5 cups of milk make half of this liquid whole milk and the other half and half or if you have heavy whipping creme us it. This makes a huge difference and might create the need to cut back on flour as this gets really thick fast. Next is while the sauce is simmering throw in two slices of american or Velveeta cheese. Last but not least is two to three cloves of garlic, pressed. Put this in during sauce thickening. I sent this home with my daughter and her husband ate almost a full half pie at a sitting. He is skinny as a rail and eats like a bird but he said this was one of the best dishes he has ever had. HE would not say that for fun. It&#39;s goooouooood!     Also, I substitute shrimp for the chicken some times and make Shrimp Pot Pie. Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmm!  Gary"
4.0,What kind of potatoes
4.0,Had no issue with flour as others have had.  It was the perfect consistency.  Very tasty!  Teenage daughter said it was &#34;the bomb&#34;......The prep work took a lot longer than 40 min as recipe stated.
4.0,I would use the potato and carrot water and less flour and milk.  The starch from the water will help to thicken the sauce and add flavor.
4.0,"Really needs to have weights for salt, sugar and flour. Tasty recipe though."
4.0,"Turned out really good. I should&#39;ve formed mine better, I just dumped it in there so the top was a bit funky ;D I did halve this recipe. My first attempt at making bread and it makes me want to try other recipes! Really tasty, I&#39;m glad it was a success!"
4.0,Garnish with CILANTRO!!! Additions: puree an additional can of beans to thicken chili; season chicken with poultry seasoning to enhance the flavor; add sliced cremini mushrooms for a heartier bowl.
4.0,"6 cups of flour would have been way too much I stopped at just over 5 cups, plenty!"
4.0,reserving judgement until the b0oss weighs in  ;))
4.0,My bread didnt rise.  I followed to the tee.  :-[
4.0,Excellent recipe! I did sub nutmeg for cloves and baked in greased floured tiny cupcake pan...came out perfect at 12 minutes..350°....a keeper!!!
4.0,"I have made this recipe a few times now and it has become my go to recipe. I  generally always end up using a mixture of whole wheat and regular all purpose flour and it turns out great. I use this recipe not only for bread, &#39;but also for homemade calzones and stromboli.  It really is a great all purpose bread dough."
4.0,The zucchini muffins were okay; however it was some of the best icing I have ever tasted!  The icing was beyond amazing!!!
4.0,Great Frosting to use on other cupcakes and cakes
4.0,"&gt; I totally loved these cute cupcakes... but I turned them n2 holiday breads - I used the zucchini, crushed pineapple, raisins &amp; either chopped walnuts or pecans (salted) - WOW - they were so good - I made 35 and all of them got sold at the Christmas craft festival this year! I will make these again... both as cupcakes and breads!"
4.0,This white chili is awesome.  I have shared the recipe many times.  Family and friend favorite.
4.0,"I made a bundt cake instead of cupcakes. It&#39;s a very moist cake, very yummy although very sweet. It didn&#39;t even need frosting but was yummy nevertheless. I&#39;m going to make it again but will use less sugar."
4.0,"I made this as a bundt cake -- very moist and delicious. A little too sweet for my taste with the frosting, so will make it again without frosting and perhaps will cut down on sugar."
4.0,"This was really good, even though I cheated and used canned frosting!  I had extra batter too!"
4.0,"These cupcakes are easy to make and have a wonderful flavor.  The cream cheese frosting with added cinnamon is a hit and I will be using it for other cakes (like carrot cake).  The cupcakes tend to collapse and become flat topped instead of the usual cupcake shape.  However, the shape doesn&#39;t detract from the flavor.  My family loved them!"
4.0,Too much icing left over. Could I use the already made cream cheese frosting in the tub?
4.0,This was very easy and my family loved it. I did use lowfat sour cream and my son added cheese to his bowl.
4.0,"We tried this recently as I have a surplus of zucchini. My boys loved them. I had no problem with the frosting as is, make sure you let it actually get down to lukewarm if you are having problems with the consistency. Setting it in a pan of cool water can speed the process. I baked mine for 20 min. for the first 12, then 18 the second as I found them a little dry."
4.0,"Really yummy cupcakes. I would make these again. I liked the flavor of the frosting, but it didn&#39;t set up very well. Maybe it was soft because my butter wasn&#39;t cold enough? The cupcakes are delicious without frosting."
4.0,Yummy! Very easy too!
4.0,What can I substitute for the orange juice.
4.0,"They were good, I like cloves, but don&#39;t love them, if I did these might get 5 stars."
4.0,Delicious.
4.0,"I love how versatile zucchini is!!  These cupcakes are so moist and a great way to use up all those zucchini you have growing in the garden.  Kids will love them too and a great way for picky eaters to more veggies.      Karen Wise, Volunteer Field Editor"
4.0,A great fall treat!
4.0,"I made these gluten free and sugar free, still very good!"
4.0,"only made the muffins, without the icing as I don&#39;t like caramel... but nice and light and moist. A good recipe to exchange the zucchini for carrots, but my zucchini was ripe, the carrots aren&#39;t yet.  Next time!"
4.0,very good but the frosting was a little tricky. kinda came out a little runny but not bad
4.0,Really good. But were a bit spongy and some didn&#39;t rise.
4.0,"This recipe is delicious HOWEVER I have made it more than once and the frosting is always super liquidy, no clue why I&#39;ve even tried making it with extra powdered sugar"
4.0,These were good but I did take others advice and cut the sugar down to 2 cups and they were still a little sweet for me but yummy all the same!
4.0,Does anyone know if this can be made ahead and frozen? It is delicious and I&#39;d like to have it in the freezer for unexpected company.
4.0,Lot of potatoes and potato taste in this recipe.  Almost tastes like a hashbrown casserole.
4.0,Really good and easy too.  I used a combo of bacon and sausage that worked out well.
4.0,"Made this in a bundt pan and other then not baking for as long as in a bread pan, it came out very good! Easy and yummy!"
4.0,I haven&#39;t tried it yet but wonder how the Amish prepared potatoes for it.  I&#39;m SURE they didn&#39;t use frozen hash browns.
4.0,I made this for our Christmas morning breakfast and we really enjoyed it. Now that I&#39;ve tried it once I would add some additional ingredients next time I made it.
4.0,"I made this casserole yesterday with 1 lb of breakfast sausage. It&#39;s okay, but don&#39;t think it has enough flavor that I would make it again."
4.0,Good flavor but mine turned out a little on the dry side.  I think it needs a little milk.
4.0,"I added a handful of left over italian sausage from the previous nights lasagna, omitted thw swiss cheese and used freshly shredded potatoes.  It turned out a bit dark from the fresh potatos but we all really enjoyed it.  There was enough for left overs the next morning which were even better!"
4.0,My family really liked this casserole.  The next time I make it I want to try other veggies and meat.  I think you can do a lot with this and it will always taste good.
4.0,This is a deliious breakfast casserole.  My entire family enjoyed it! I am making it again this weekend while we are snowed in! Thank you for submiting it!!
4.0,Loved the frosting!  Cupcakes were a little dry and I only baked them 20 min.  Would try 15 next time.
4.0,The flavor in this was very good.  It is easy to double for a large kettle.  I found it slightly soupy for my taste but I added some mashed potato flakes and it was great.  The leftovers made a great base for green chili chicken enchiladas.
4.0,Really easy and tasty! Loved it!
4.0,I used applesauce rather than oil.  Next time I make them I will use half oil/half applesauce to  remedy their dryness at the edges.  They stuck to the baking papers.
4.0,Very tasty!
4.0,"Amazing! Frosting was very sweet, I added the entire 2 C of powdered sugar and I wish I would have added a little less. But these were fantastic!"
4.0,I was a little dissapointed. Cupcakes turned out on the dry side. Perhaps the bake time should be reduced. Will not make again. I will stick to my no fail zucchini bread.
4.0,"Turned out great! The frosting turned out more like an icing for me, either way it was delicious, had a maple taste to it."
4.0,i made these today my husband and son said these are execelent they we easy to make i added about 1\2 cup more zucchini cooked only for about 12 min the frosting is really good but hard time getting it the consistancy i wanted but u should try them they&#39;re greatttttt u wont be disappointed
4.0,Very good but the icing makes this cupcake complete.
4.0,"The cupcakes were moist &amp; were liked by the crew of volunteers at the food pantry.  I did not like the frosting, much too sweet, so instead frosted them with cream cheese frosting."
4.0,"This was good but can use improving - I used 8 eggs, didn&#39;t have swiss cheese so used some sour cream, added salt (and it still needed some when I served it!). Very good idea and you can definitely play with the recipe, add ingredients that you like!"
4.0,"Tasty and easy to create but somewhat bland.  I will definitely make it again adding green &amp; red peppers, perhaps black olives.  My son added salsa as a topping saying it was perfect."
4.0,This is a great casserole for breakfast or any other meal!  It lends itself to being very adaptable. I used pepperjack and a little less cheese also. I have tried it with spicy Italian sausage and another time with diced Polish Kielbasa.  Always rave reviews from the peanut gallery!
4.0,"I substituted applesauce for the oil in a small attempt to make this recipe healthier, but I think it made it chewy.  I also didn&#39;t have any buttermilk, so I had to find a substitute for that as well.  It&#39;s a good recipe and next time I&#39;ll make it with all the ingredients and no subs."
4.0,MY husband really liked this. Used Sasuage  &amp; added a dash of Cayenne pepper. Will try pepper jack next time. We like kick
4.0,"Quick, simple and delicious!"
4.0,"This recipe is tasty and easy to make.  I gave it 4 stars as it could be considered a little bland.  Next time, I&#39;m going to try pepperjack instead of swiss.All in all, I liked it and would not hesitate to make this dish again!  Thanks for the recipe!"

4.0,"This was kind of boring by itself, but a good standard to add green chilies and spices. Could probably also use only one cheese."
4.0,"enjoyed the cottage cheese, made it creamy! easy to make and I used turkey sausage vs. bacon."
4.0,I want to make this casserole for company. Has anyone tried making it and freezing it ahead of time?
4.0,Very good recipe!  The frosting is a little time consuming.  Next time I will just use a quick cream cheese frosting to cut back on time a little.
4.0,i made these for a sale at work they loved them rondha sullivan
4.0,"Mine were a bit dry, even though I didn&#39;t drain my zucchini.  Good flavor, great frosting.  Leave the frosting get to room temp before adding confectioner&#39;s sugar and you won&#39;t have any problems with the consistency."
4.0,"This was a nice treat!  The frosting is very sweet, but my family loved it.  I think they tasted much better the second day as the flavors seemed to blend more, and the intensity of the frosting seemed to mellow a bit."
4.0,My frosting did not turn out like the picture but the cupcakes were great.  I love the OJ and extract in them!
4.0,"Easy to make.  Frosting took a while because of letting it cool, but well worth the effort!"
4.0,My 4 year old helped me make these so she could take a &#39;treat&#39; to daycare! They were a big hit!! They never knew that they were eating their vegetables! Great recipe!
4.0,"Very Yummy, and the frosting is Fabu!"
4.0,Added green chilis and chopped red pepper.  It turned out really good!
4.0,"Very good. I added green chili&#39;s as well, and it was awesome.I think the negative people are real downers and takes away from the fun of this site. Please everyone.....be positive."
4.0,would prefer that people not preach their own opinions that refer to ingredients.  all can read the recipe and understand and decide if it&#39;s to their liking.
4.0,OK Easy to make. Not a strong flavor. Bacon was a nice change from sausage but maybe could use some vegetable .
4.0,"Good, easy...good staple for a morning brunch."
4.0,This was good and a nice change but I felt it needed a bit more flavor for my tastes.  I liked that it used potatoes instread of bread.  I did add ground pepper but felt it still needed something else.  I will try it again but next time will try some of the other suggestions like pepper jack cheese instead of swisss and/or southwest potatoes instead of plain potatoes and/or the addition of sautéed peppers and garlic. This is just a personal preference for something with a little more &#34;kick&#34;.
4.0,Love this! Make it for work all the time because it works for those needing gluten free :-) always takes longer to cook then this says though
4.0,We were disappointed after all of the great reviews for this recipe.  The only changes made were to add 1 tsp minced garlic and use 33% less sodium chicken broth.  This was just okay for us.  Perhaps we prefer beef chili instead!
4.0,These were delicious. Cut back on milk and brown sugar as I don&#39;t like them too sweet. They can also be frozen.
4.0,"Very tasty! We loved the sauce.  This is a little different than my usual meatloaf recipe, and I think my family actually liked this one better!"
4.0,I cannot see the recipe because of the advertisement covering it. I only see the partial ingredients. Egglands Best takes up a huge square over the ingredients!
4.0,omg its looking so tasty
4.0,"Very yummy! My mom always made these growing up. The only problem I have with the recipe, is there’s too much milk and makes the mixture too soupy. I put 1/3 cup or less and it comes out much better texture. The original recipe form Taste of home cookbook, calls for 1 (5 ounce) can of evaporated milk. I need to try that!"
4.0,"Made as one whole meatloaf, after all meatloaf is supposed to be easy! Loved the sauce. Very good. Also, made with leftover rice next time, because I needed to use it. Worked out fine!"
4.0,So good and easy to make. I have made them several times because I can use gluten free oatmeal . We have 3 celiacs in the family. I doubled the recipe but made a single recipe of the sauce. I like the flavor of the meatloaf to shine through.
4.0,What a great recipe for family fare! Been meaning to try these for some time and today amidst everyone’s mid-December running-around I discovered some plans had changed and I needed to provide a last minute supper whilst still running errands. I found I had all the ingredients and they came together and cooked speedily. I made exactly to recipe and they tasted  great!    This must rank as a TOH classic. Thanks  for sharing and for keeping available for decades for us to enjoy.
4.0,looking very delicious
4.0,"I gave it 4 stars because my son really liked it, but my daughter and I thought it was just okay"
4.0,My family loves this but it never seems to be done in 35-40 minutes.  My oven is set at 350 what am I dining wrong?  Any suggestions?
4.0,I made this with ham and green chilis so my husband could grab a scoop and heat it up quick before heading off  to work in the mornings. He loved it and thought the recipe deserved 4 and a half stars. He said he left the half star off because there might be a little too much cheese. Will try with bacon and less cheese next time!
4.0,"I made this as the recipe directed (except I prepared my bacon on a sheet pan in the oven and then added it along with drippings to the skillet with onion), and it was delicious.  The first batch went to the kids at church, so my own family requested a batch for home.  Simple to prepare.  Hearty and Satisfying."
4.0,Yummy! I’d make it again.
4.0,"I enjoyed this casserole and served it for Easter breakfast at my house. We really liked the combination of the cheddar and Swiss cheeses. I did add some seasoned salt and pepper to taste, as I thought it needed some seasoning."
4.0,"These little meatloaves are tender and tasty. The sauce is sweet, which my kids love. I do wish I could have tasted the cheddar because I love cheese."
4.0,Pretty good.  I didnt add any brown sugar or onions because I didn&#39;t have any. And i had to use bread crumbs instead of oats but it was still great!!
4.0,"I too  make Mini meatloaves. But I use a small corn bread loaf pan to form them.  Spray the m ini pan  an d pack with the meatloaf mixture, shake out into the Baking pan.   Continue withe the balance of the mixture"
4.0,"We like this recipe as it&#39;s very tasty and different. I added diced celery, and bell pepper since I was out of the green chili&#39;s, and added an extra can of beans. My husband really liked it."
4.0,Needed a little more seasoning. Added some garlic. Yum
4.0,"I thought it was very good, just a little too sweet. So I&#39;m making it again and cutting down on the brown sugar."
4.0,<p>This is nice and wonderful.</p>
4.0,I have froze these before. They thaw in microwave or gravy on stove top or in oven.
4.0,"This was very tasty. The meatloaf I usually make is very similar to this, except without the cheese, so it wasn&#39;t a stretch to think my family would like this recipe. Especially my 3 year old, of course. This is definitely a winner!"
4.0,"This was very tasty. My meatloaf recipe is very similar to this, except without the added cheese, so it wasn&#39;t a stretch to think my family would like this recipe. Especially my 3 year old. It&#39;s a winner!"

4.0,"I used extra lean ground beef and it was rather greasy. We didn&#39;t taste any cheddar cheese in the meat loaf, so I&#39;m thinking the melting cheese added to the grease in the pan. We liked the ketchup mixture, but will cut back on the brown sugar next time since it was a little too sweet for our taste."
4.0,"I loved this recipe because it was fast and easy. Tasted amazing! This is a great meal to make if you have a busy schedule. My husband loved it, and wants me to make it again very soon!"
4.0,This was very good. I forgot to put the sour cream and whipping cream in stiil good
4.0,"My husband and I loved it and I would make it again for us, but the kids did not care for it.  Too many beans for their taste.  I followed another reviewers suggestion to cook it in the crock-pot on low and stirred in the sour cream and cream about 30 minutes before serving."
4.0,"This soup is good and easy to make.  I did make a few changes--I used leftover chicken, 3 cans beans, a little extra water to simmer in, and I left out the cream because I didn&#39;t want it any thinner.  I would use milk to thin if needed.  It was yummy and easy."
4.0,"We love this recipe, any one I make this for loves it and asks for it.  I would give it 5 stars but for one thing.  As delicious as it is, I think it is much improved with the addition of some cilantro."
4.0,Too spicy for my taste. I should have left out the cayenne pepper. Otherwise really good flavor!
4.0,<p>This was delicious!</p>
4.0,"I use diced ham I purchase in the package instead of bacon, the bacon was too greasy for me. I also add spinach, and/or green pepper."
4.0,Very good.  The only thing I would do differently would be to add a 3rd can of beans.
4.0,My Boyfriend is a trainer and picky eater this fit the bill for us both!
4.0,"I see some reviews by the inevitable health nags.  Well, all I can say is look at the number of reviews this recipe has - you&#39;re outvoted LOL!  Made this and it was loved by youngsters and oldsters alike!"
4.0,"Good recipe,  easy quick. I added smoked paprika, green peppers, garlic, thyme, used Velveeta,  sharp cheddar, and cream cheese. I didn&#39;t make a roux as I didn&#39;t want it to thick, added some cornstarch and it was perfect.  Topped w bacon.  I will definitely make this again."
4.0,"Actually, maybe I will make this again.  I used one pound of ground beef like man suggested and it was a little too beefy.  Otherwise, good."
4.0,"Pretty good soup, but it needs a bit much seasoning, such as red pepper flakes &amp; garlic. And some crumbled crispy bacon mixed in would be terrific. "

4.0,Very tasty soup...be careful though!!  Really really rich and filling.  My family liked it and I will make it again.

4.0,"New family favorite. Instead of water add more chicken broth, instead of diced tomatoes add diced tomatoes with green chili (rotel works well). Wonderful with fresh bread."
4.0,"I make a similar soup but also add Zucchini, Yellow Squash and Carrots"
4.0,Great flavor but not as thick as I would have like it.  But even my fussy eaters (who were not looking forward to it) liked it!
4.0,"I&#39;ve been looking for a great chicken chili recipe.  This one doesn&#39;t quite fit the bill for my family,  although it&#39;s good.  It&#39;s just missing that something special.  Maybe cilantro would make the difference."
4.0,"I use a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket.  I make it without the green chilies so to give it more flavor, I add concentrated chicken broth.  I use a little less sour cream and heavy cream like the others had suggested to make it thicker.  It freezes well."
4.0,Yummy. Doesn&#39;t freeze well with the tortellini in it.
4.0,"Turkey Italian sausage is very bland so I added some fennel seed, anise seed and oregano. Very good, especially with my husband&#39;s homemade Italian bread. I think next time I will use regular Italian sausage for better flavor."
4.0,"This is a hearty and wonderfully flavored soup! I used spicy Italian sausage, added 1 chopped green pepper, a couple chopped carrots, and a cup of corn and some extra broth. Delish!"
4.0,This turned out well.
4.0,"I made half recipe for lunch today for 2 and all is gone. I forgot the sour cream and used fresh parsley and used the lesser amount of Velveeta. My non-soup loving husband liked this soup. I can see why it appeals to most people, but I like spicier soups. I also think the soup is thick enough with the potatoes that the flour slurry is not needed. A sharp Cheddar in lieu of the Velveeta might be an improvement."
4.0,"Good kid friendly recipe.  I agree with the other poster, about leaving out the sour cream.  It did give it a Stroganoff flavor. I didn&#39;t have parsley and basil so I used Italian seasoning instead and it turned out just fine."

4.0,"I was looking for more flavor in this soup since this recipe was given such high ratings. Our family rated it as good, but average in flavor, so I won&#39;t be making it again."

4.0,"So flavorful, I couldn&#39;t stop at just one bowl!"
4.0,"Made this soup yesterday, added green chili so now we have the recipe Green Chile Cheeseburger Soup. Was really good."
4.0,"Made this soup yesterday, added green chili so now we have the recipe Green Chile Cheeseburger Soup. Was really good."
4.0,"This recipe was pretty good.  I used a pound of ground beef instead of a half pound, and I left my potatoes on too high of heat for too long (I got a phone call) so they went mushy and dissolved.  Other than that it was really good, and I would recomend it to anyone who loves cheeseburgers and soup!"

4.0,"It&#39;s delicious, but as written this is more like a cheesy potato soup that happens to have a liiiiiittle bit of beef in it, too little for me to call it a cheeseburger soup. Next time I&#39;ll use a full pound of beef and maybe cut back on the potatoes some."
4.0,"Made this soup tonight, the family LOVED it.  Will definitely put it in the cookbook to make again.  Thanks!"
4.0,"Our kids and I love this recipe, but my husband isn&#39;t crazy about it for some reason. I make this on nights he has to work."
4.0,"This was a hit in our house. I followed the recipe exactly, but next time I would double the amount of meat and half the amount of potatoes. But even as is, everyone enjoyed it and the leftovers got eaten the next day for lunch."
4.0,Excellent recipe and directions are easy to follow. My only suggestion is to have fun with the recipe and  serve pickle relish and ketchup on the side. My guestsenjoyed the recipe and laughed. Made their evening!!
4.0,"I made this soup for dinner last night based on reviews that stated their husbands do not care for soup, but loved this one.  My husband does not care for soup, but I LOVE all soups.  I thought this soup was really good and would definately eat it again.  My husband said it was OK and would eat it again as a filler.  The only change I made was to use 1 pound of hamburger.  I can&#39;t imagine that 1/2 pound would be enough."
4.0,Very good. My friend thought he would prefer it with a little less cheese.
4.0,"I just got done making this for dinner tonight, I used italian sausge meat as well with ground beef. Turned out good!"
4.0,"Didn&#39;t change a thing. Turned out delicious. Next time I won&#39;t cut the potatoes too small, like someone suggested."
4.0,Very nice recipe!  This soup was really good and filling.  Great leftovers for next day lunch too.  Will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing!
4.0,"I totally forgot the sour cream, but did add 2+ tsp Worchestershire sauce. That really enhanced the flavor! I also added some shredded cheese as the Velveeta is a little bland for this Wisconsinite. I did use fewer potatoes as one reviewer noted, and a little less broth as we line thicker  soups."
4.0,Easy and tasty
4.0,"Used Johnsonville hot Italian sausage and closer to 9 oz. spinach.  All three of my kids said they&#39;d have liked it to have had more tortellini.  Overall, very good though."
4.0,Tasted great. Next time I may add sweet corn
4.0,"This was very good, but I will add an extra can of beans next time."
4.0,Got good reviews but I wanted a little something more flavorwise.  I will tweak next time.  Maybe it needs some bacon?
4.0,Wasn&#39;t sure about the recipe when I started out with the first few ingredients but LOVED the end result!  I used whole grain tortellini and added some fresh tomato.  I let the first 6 ingredients simmer for about 1 hour before I added the rest.
4.0,"4 1/2 stars, very good and easy to fix"
4.0,"The day I made it I wasn&#39;t terribly impressed, but it was better the next day.  It gave the flavors time to &#34;marry&#34;."
4.0,"A bit too much spinach for my husband and me. I think I will substitute some zucchini next time. Other than that, it was easy to prepare and tasty to eat. Leftovers were even better."
4.0,I really like the flavors of this soup. This is the ideal soup to pair with a salad and breadsticks.
4.0,Fast and delicious!
4.0,"I liked this soup. I made a couple of small changes. I did not add the water, and I&#39;m glad that I did. I used a low-sodium organic chicken broth. I also added about 1 Tbsp of tomato paste. I used HOT turkey sausage, so I didn&#39;t need the red pepper. I love basil, but I chose thyme and oregano as my seasoning.This recipe came together fast, and it is very good. Thanks!"
4.0,"I made this tonight! I did change it up a little bit though! I omitted the carrots, and the roux used to thicken the soup. When a soup has lots of cheese like this one does a roux to thicken things isnt really necessary in my opinion. I added a little bit of dill weed as well, which gave it a little kick. My boyfriend had picked out a hickory smoked bourbon gouda that he decided he wasnt a fan of after I already sliced some for his lunch, so I threw that in there too! We&#39;re definitely going to be making it again :)"
4.0,"A family favorite around here. We substitute real cheese for velveeta, and that just increases the flavor!"
4.0,This soup is delicious; but I only gave it 4 stars because it is so much work.  I have found an easier version made in the crockpot that I will make from now on.
4.0,My five kids absolutely loved this twist on potato soup!
4.0,Very good.  Modified with turkey and added a can of Italian diced tomatoes.  Only drawback is that its a lot of prep time.
4.0,"I made this recipe when we were both under the weather.  I thought it had a very good flavor, but I substituted 1 cup of heavy cream for part of the milk.  I left out the basil, but added garlic.  I went a little lighter on the salt, and I&#39;m glad I di.  I used real cheese instead of Velveeta, and fewer potatoes.  The next time I make it, I&#39;m going to add at least 8 strips of bacon, chopped fine and maybe a hit of dijon mustard, to keep it &#39;cheeseburger-y&#39;."
4.0,I made it for a work fundraiser and it was a big hit. I will make it again but we did add some extra seasonings.
4.0,"Make a similar version - using ground turkey, Worchestershire sauce, touch of chili powder or Tabasco, garlic, sm can of Ro-tel diced tomatoes, bag of frozen corn and 8-oz bag of low-fat Mexican shredded cheese added toward end - don&#39;t need the flour with natural starch from corn &amp; potatoes.  Very hearty comfort food!  Great with corn bread!!!"
4.0,This is a recipe I would definitely make again. I made a few changes and used ground turkey breast and shredded sharp cheddar cheese instead of Velvetta. It got rave reviews from my family.
4.0,"@ lilaccrew, directions state:Cheeseburger SoupTell us what you think of this recipe.Did you modify it? Would you make it again?  And what of your statement is a review?   Very good recipe as is but due for health reasons our family too has since found ways to modify it to meet our needs similar to those buzzbombz posted."
4.0,"Four stars for over-abundance of fat, sodium content - uninteresting seasonings.Thought suggestions might be welcome since soup is basically the same name and the different ingredients could offer some flexibility.  It&#39;s such a simple recipe, I never thought to submit it.  Thanks &#34;chocoholiclady&#34; for understanding the comments &amp; reasoning.....lessened the attack."
4.0,"Good stuff!!! THINGS I DID DIFFERENTLY: I sauteed 1 fresh garlic clove and one finely chopped jalapeno, upped more spices, added a dash of cinnamon and shredded a pre-roasted chicken to save time. I also added more cayenne pepper because it just wasn&#39;t spicy enough for me. I also mashed up one can of the beans to help thicken it a bit. And I used garlic salt instead of reg. salt. I added bacon crumbles and sharp cheddar. This made it super flavorful and CLEARLY not healthy. At all. But so good."
4.0,"Please review ingredient list!
It says a small package of Lime Jello (.3 ounces). I think that&#39;s a mistake. Our small packages are 3 ounces not .3...
So, I used the complete package..and it tasted delicious.  Note: I did not use reduced fat ingredients."
4.0,"I made it, and it tasted great, however a package of knox gelatin was needed to make it firm.                                                                                            Today instead of Key Lime, I made it with Strawberries.  Excellent!"
4.0,"Knew from the start this recipe needed to be doubled. Added 1 lb. chicken/beef meatballs sliced in half, plus about 2 c.  petite mixed frozen vegetables 10 mins. before serving. Along with a whole wheat hard roll = nummy nummy in my tummy !"
4.0,I prepared this dish for a holiday get-together and received great feedback.
4.0,My husband loved it. I think it could use an extra half pound of beef. The only thing I changed was adding paprika to the finished product. A bread bowl wouldve been nice to as it is very cheesey. Get the good cheese!
4.0,My family all loved this I added a 1lb hamburger but my 6 year old said it needed more.  Next time I will add more but it was very good.
4.0,Very tasty and kid friendly!!!
4.0,I&#39;ve been making a variation of this for years.  My husband loves it.Tip:  it&#39;s way easier to add the extra butter and then the flour to the celery and onion mixture than it is to make a separate roux.  You have more control over how thick your soup will be and you don&#39;t have to mess up an extra pan.  It&#39;s an extra step that&#39;s very unnecessary.
4.0,I made this soup and my whole family loved it. It was easy to made and plan to make it often. The only think I changed was put in a little more cheese (sharp cheddar) as we love cheese.
4.0,"This gave me a very good starting recipe to work with for Cheeseburger Soup.  Because I am feeding 5 adults, I used a full pound of ground beef and 14 oz of velveeta and 5 pounds of potatoes.  I am not a fan of the  carrots and celery in this soup so I left them out and added garlic powder, a little cayenne powder.  I also used 1 cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of whole milk to have a little more richness in the soup.I will make this soup many more times.  Thank you so much for the recipe."
4.0,"Added a beer, hot sauce, extra cup of cheddar and chicken broth to give it the kick we wanted.  Served with baguette."
4.0,DH and I liked it but my kids wouldn&#39;t even try it.  It was really good though.  Kind of labor intensive though.
4.0,"Pretty good recipe.  I made mine low-fat, low-calorie; ground turkey, no butter but 1 tbps when sauteeing veggies, 2% velvetta, RF sour cream, skim milk, etc.  Would make again but add about 4 oz more cheese this time, I didn&#39;t think it was cheesy enough.  Tasted better the next day heated up."
4.0,If you puree (I use my hand blender) one can of the beans it becomes the thickener with no need for flour
4.0,Great recipe ?? we used carb master yogurt to cut the carbs ? my daughter is a type 1 diabetic so we gotta watch those ?? anybody knocking this recipe or anything sugar free !!! Some people aren&#39;t as fortunate or have no choice with certain things ???? my daughter can still consume sugars etc and to be honest white bread would spike her more then a snicker bar lol contrary to belief...
4.0,"This was very good.  I used regular lime gelatin, not sugar-free, since the sugar-free gelatins always take forever to dissolve completely.  The pie was very tasty and looked cool and lovely.  I brought it to a club meeting and it disappeared almost immediately!"
4.0,Very good &amp; easy.
4.0,"Loved it!  I did not have key lime jello, so I used unflavored gelatin and substituted  lime juice for the water.  The pie was awesome.  This will be a repeat at our house!"
4.0,This is a good pie.
4.0,"Actually key lime juice is yellow, not green and the limes themselves are more a yellow color.  They&#39;re a lot different than regular limes.  But that is neither here nor there, this is a very simple recipe for a nice treat, especially for diabetics.  I&#39;ve had this and it&#39;s tasty!"
4.0,For those hung up on the color of this pie...Key lime pie really is not green unless food  color is used..Key lime pie is a pale yellow green. I intend to make this soon...looks so good and inexpensive  and light on the calories and fat. The other flavors people have mentioned sounds great too.
4.0,"I prepare a dessert bar for the Fire Dept&#39;s monthly fundraising dinners and I always include a diabetic-friendly dessert.  I will definitely try this recipe.  Key lime pies go over well with our guests, so I know this key-lime-like substitute will make our sugar-conscious guests very happy.  I can&#39;t wait to try it with other flavors, too.  This sounds like a winner. Thanks! (star rating for all things about it; add&#39;l star missing only because I haven&#39;t made it yet!)"
4.0,"Soup was awesome, would definitely make it again. I used 1 cup shredded cheddar instead of Velvetta. I just added it to the butter/ flour mixture and added the milk too. Then later I added another cup of cheddar cheese. Soup was not too salty, I actually had to add more salt than what the recipe called for. Also, I would definitely not add the sour cream at all. I tried the soup before adding sour cream and it was much better than after."
4.0,pretty good very thick
4.0,"This was just as delicious as it was easy... I substituted plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream. I will definitely make it again. A little goes a long way, very filling!"
4.0,"Super good!  I will agree with some of the reviews that it is on the salty side, but kendya gave great suggestions on how to cut down on some of the sodium content.  I&#39;ll definitely keep this recipe!"
4.0,"This was very good - comfort food is what my daughter called it.  I used a full lb. of ground beef, and added a few drops of sriracha sauce.  I will be making this again!"
4.0,"I doubled this recipe and it came out soupy so I added leftover mashed potatoes.  I think if leftover mashed potatoes aren&#39;t on hand, I&#39;d try potato flakes to thicken it up."
4.0,Delicious and super easy made the house smell great on a frigid winter day!
4.0,Th only thing I will change is the basil. I would cut the amount in half. I also will experiment and sub. oregano for the basil.
4.0,"I added ketchup, mustard,and chopped up pickles and it rocked!!!  I&#39;d leave the potatoes out next time, or else chop then up really tiny."
4.0,Make some bacon and crumble it on top of the soup before serving. Delicious!
4.0,Good recipe. But on day 2 you need to serve the rest or freeze it. Chicken only tastes good for max of 2 days
4.0,Quick and easy.  Very light.
4.0,Very good and summer good.
4.0,I added 1 tablespoon of lime juice to the recipe.
4.0,"I  love Key Lime Pie and don&#39;t eat it because of my diatbetes, so was very excited to see this easy recipe for a lime flavored pie.  It was simple and very good.  Still can&#39;t eat too much of it but it&#39;s a nice treat.  I added some lime zest to it for extra flavor.  Definitely make ahead of time so it has time to really firm up before serving.  Giving it a 4 rating only because it isn&#39;t really key lime other than what is in the yogurt."
4.0,This was just OK. It wasn&#39;t bad but I thought it was missing something (corn? cilantro? not sure what). I gave it 4 stars because of the ease of the recipe. Not sure how this recipe wins cook-off&#39;s though...
4.0,"Tastes like a grilled Cheeseburger. Different &amp; easy, good over egg noodles.  The potatoes seemed strange at first, but then they blended in &amp; reminded me of burger &amp; fries.  I tweaked it.  Tripled the beef &amp; added better than boullion beef flavor, a cup each of veggies, bumped up the spices, Campbells beef consomm? &amp; French onion soup plus two cans of water. Left the potato amount the same &amp; added more cheese.  Left out the sour cream since it tasted good as is.  All you need is crusty bread &amp; a pickle!"
4.0,Hearty supper.
4.0,"Made as directed.  It was good, but not exceptional.  I thought with all the 5 star reviews it would be better.  Hubby loved it!"
4.0,Clipnmom - 8 oz cheese = 2 cups when grated.  I use cheddar cheese or pepper jack because I don&#39;t like processed cheese. I add a dash of worchestershire sauce too.  Crumbled bacon and chopped tomato on top = YUMMY!
4.0,"For my family&#39;s taste I will use more hamburger and less potatoes.  We all liked it though.  I followed the recipe exactly, but might try some cheddar next time."
4.0,Excellent!  Next time I am going to add a bit more seasoning to give it more flavor.
4.0,I made this soup but added 1 cup of cooked bacon and 1 Tablespoon bacon drippings.  My family devoured it!
4.0,"I hate ranking this recipe because I did not make this strictly according to the directions because I wanted to make it a bit healthier and I eliminated the meat.  However, I have no doubt that had I used the flour and butter roux it would have made the soup even richer and tastier. I was happy to find a cheese soup recipe that didn&#39;t use broccoli since one of my family members doesn&#39;t like it.  I did double the recipe and it was very good! That being said here&#39;s what I did: I put the onion, celery and carrots and 1 cup of broth in the soup pot and simmered for 10 minutes.  I then added the potatoes, the rest of the broth, the basil and parsley and simmered for another 10 minutes, until the potatoes were done.  To thicken the soup, I then mixed some chicken broth and cornstarch in a cup and added that to the broth/veggies mix, stirring constantly.   I heated the milk and Velveeta in the microwave, stirring occasionally until the cheese was mostly melted.  I added the cheese/milk mix after the potatoes were cooked.  I did not add any salt and I did not use the sour cream.  I ended up with a delicious soup that was a bit healthier and I served it in homemade bread bowls.   Very, very good!"
4.0,"I made this today for St Patricks Day.  It is so refreshing, light and delicious."
4.0,This was awesome. Light &amp; fluffy and low calorie. I made it for work and even co-workers on a diet ate some.
4.0,I actually made this with berry jell-o and whipped strawberry yougurt.  Everyone that ate it loved it!  I can&#39;t wait to try this with another flavor.
4.0,"So I read the reviews before making this. I have never made white chili before but we tend to like our soups more like stew and our chili super thick. So after the chicken, onions and garlic (I used fresh garlic) were cooked I added two TBSP of flour and all the seasonings to the pot, stirred it in to coat the meat and let it cook for a couple minutes. Then I added the broth, chiles and three cans of beans. Finally I replaced the sour cream and whipping cream with cream cheese. SO Yummy!"
4.0,"This is an absolutely delicious recipe. I actually tripled the recipe and added about 1 cup grated parmesan cheese. It was not as thick as I would have liked it to be and was more like a soup than a chili but nonetheless,  it was extremely flavorful and tasty!! I will definitely make this again!!"
4.0,"I made this pie for St Patrick&#39;s Day. As lime is not my favorite, I will make it only for special occasions like St. Patrick&#39;s Day, but it was quick and easy. However, I found that all the jello did not get completely &#39;folded in&#39; as there were a few chewy pieces of the jello spread throughout the pie. I also found that the crust apparently absorbed some liquid from the filling as it was a little softer than I would have liked. Maybe that was because I used Dream Whip instead of Cool Whip which I did not have on hand and no time to go out and purchase some."
4.0,"I LOVELOVELOVE white chicken chili and play around with recipes for it often! This was Good! I did change/add quite a bit, but my favorite too to share is this: I saw a lot of people thickening with flour and gagged a little, lol! As a southern cook, my grandma taught me long ago to slowly sprinkle in instant mashed potatoe flakes to soups, etc! You don&#39;t taste the potato, it thickens Instantly and No Lumps!! Anyway... here&#39;s my other many, many tweaks: I used a cold store-bought chicken and sauteed a large, chopped Vidalia onion, half of a chopped red bell pepper, and added fresh, minced garlic to the veggies once they were softened. I didn&#39;t have green chiles, so I added two (Drained!!!) cans of Diced tomatoes with green chiles (one mild and one &#34;Mexican&#34; flavored, YUM!) Also, I had 2 cans of Canellini beans (white kidney beans) instead of great northern. As far as spice... I doubled or tripled the cumin- we like that flavor a LOT- and added a few handfuls of chopped cilantro. Also I seasoned the sauteing veg mix with the yellow Adobo and the Sazon Completa seasonings. Served this with chips, Monterey Jack cheese, guacamole and LOTS more fresh cilantro! So good but...sorry this was so long!"
4.0,I gave this 4 stars because I followed this recipe to a T but omitting the sour cream and heavy whip. I mashed 1 can of beans to thicken the soul and added fresh garlic along with the powdered garlic. I also added more seasoning to my taste of each. I did add about 1 cup of the shredded cheese to the soup as well. I also added some frozen corn and cilantro to the soup as well as adding cilantro as a topping. This soup was amazing ??
4.0,"I love this recipe. I made my own graham cracker crust--better than store bought &amp; easy to throw together. You can definitely pick out the gelatin flavor you like and match a yogurt to it for peach, strawberry, or any flavor you like! Most of the ingredients I had on hand."
4.0,My pies set up very well.  I tried it with no-sugar red raspberry jello and reduced fat raspberry yogurt.  It disappeared as fast as the key-lime pie.
4.0,Easy and tasty!
4.0,I found this to be a bit on the heavy side for a soup.  It had more of a stew look.  But it was very tasty and made for a filling soup.
4.0,"The broth was excellent, but it seemed more like a cheesy potato soup than cheeseburger. We’ll enjoy this soup anyway, and I’ll make this again, but next time I’ll double the meat and cut back on the potatoes to make it more ’cheeseburgery’"
4.0,"I read Williams review which suggested, &#34;his was better.&#34;  What is wrong with him to be so childish and mean spirited?  .  Made the soup for my husband last night and he loved it.  Not exactly the healthiest soup, but definitely a crowd pleaser for kids and grown men!!"
4.0,Very delicious and rich and creamy did a few changes just because worked with what i had but still a very awesome succulent soup 4 stars ??
4.0,Four stars ONLY because it didn&#39;t seem to turn out quite like the others said.  Probably my fault.  However...I will definitely make it again because the husband really enjoyed it and I  think I know what I did wrong.  Hopefully.  :)  Also...didn&#39;t change ANYTHING.
4.0,"I made this pie for St. Patrick&#39;s Day and it was a big hit! For an added touch, I served it with green candied maraschino cherries and green sprinkles."
4.0,I add creme cheese and more creme. I also roast my chicken breasts in the oven and then pull and dice the meat. I have won 3 chili cook-offs with my version!  :)
4.0,"This was my first attempt at a white chili and was a little disappointed.  I added 8 oz of cream cheese instead of the sour cream and didn&#39;t like the resulting flavor.  Should have followed the recipe.  I will tinker with this some more, but all in all a very easy quick recipe."
4.0,"This recipe gave me a starting point - I had a bunch of peppers of many kinds, chopped em up. Used ground turkey I had on hand plus a can of Ro-Tel and another of diced tomatoes, threw in some Clamato juice. Pretty tasty but I didn&#39;t think it went very well with rice, which I kept on the side so I can freeze the soup leftovers. WHen I that it out  out I may add chili powder and beans, as it&#39;s a good base recipe for chili.... Overall pretty tasty...."
4.0,"next time I would use a little more spices. I only had half the tomato sauce,so added 15oz. of tomato with green chilles . I also added tbs of worcestershire , minced onions and garlic. I would also add celery"
5.0,This soup is so good!
5.0,Great recipe. Love changing the peppers when local produce is in season.  Very tasty and the smell is great. Thanks
5.0,"I do a lot of cooking and have been making this since I first saw it in TOH years ago. It is my absolute favorite soup in my large repertoire. People that tell my they hate bell peppers ask me for this soup when we get together. I use green, red, and yellow peppers—whatever I have on hand. I do add a little garlic and Worcestershire, but it’s fine without it. Very hearty, healthy, and comforting."
5.0,"This was great. Added some stuff- lots of garlic, 2 onions, a dash of Worcestershire, 3 jalapenos diced. With a house full of extremely picky eaters they all loved this soup. I think it&#39;s a first for me."
5.0,I really liked this soup.  I found it interesting that the rice needs to be cooked beforehand and can’t cook in the broth while the soup simmers for 30 min. But followed the recipe as-written and give this five stars.  Was a bit sweeter than expected so next time I might decrease the amount of brown sugar.
5.0,"Made this for the second time today  - followed the original recipe the first time - and then today incorporated ideas from some of the reviews and we liked it much better.   Instead of 6 cups of water, I used 4 cups of beef cooking stock and 2 cups of water.   Also added 3/4 cup of onions with the beef, and 3/4 cup of celery and couple teaspoons of garlic when adding the tomato sauce, etc.    Lastly, I added 1 TBSP worcestershire sauce for flavor and the result was great."
5.0,"LOVE this recipe, it&#39;s my go too.  My Taste of Home recipe is from 2012 and calls for 2 quarts of water.  I substitute 6 cups of beef stock, we like a thicker soup.  A few other tweaks, I use 1/4 cup of uncooked rice and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper.  This soup never stays very long in the refrigerator...if it makes it that far.  You won&#39;t go wrong with this recipe!"
5.0,This delicious soup like so many other reviewers have said will now be in the dinner rotation. Even my extremely picky husband enjoyed it.
5.0,Just made and it is yummy. The brown sugar must be one of ingredients that makes it so tasty.
5.0,Love this recipe! Even my husband loves it and he does not like rice.  This one is a keeper.
5.0,"Hello from Clarion PA, Krista in Meadville! 

She probably has nothing to do with the actual post and just a blurb about the restaurant. Let alone the comments section, and will never see this 😝 I am going to hope she does see it !! ❤️


This turned out great! I did a few swap outs, because teenager 🙄😑 I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced. I 100% recommend putting soup over your rice, or grain of choice. I have made a few different versions over the years and found out (I’d say kind of the hard way) the first time I made it to separate the grain and soup! You really can’t store or re-heat it well with it added in during cooking. I got gloop instead of soup the next day!"
5.0,"made according to directions, DELISH!!!!"
5.0,This is a fabulous recipe!
5.0,"Fantastic, but mild. I added half a Carolina Reaper. Delish! The hubby  said he detested white chili. As this was simmering, hubby said &#34;Boy, that sure smells great! When do we eat?&#34; He asked me to make more to freeze for later. LOL!"
5.0,"I made this alongside a traditional chili for a winter gathering and this chili stole the show. I was expecting leftovers for additional meals during the week, but nope, no leftovers. It’s mild, but there’s always ways to spice it up if that’s your preference.  If you’re thinking about it, just do it!  It’s easy, fast, warming, and delicious. Oh, and might as well double it. I did."
5.0,"This recipe was excellent!! I added the cream cheese and it was the perfect comfort food. I usually make individual portions and freeze it, but this was eaten everyday for 3 days. Exceptional!"
5.0,"Best white chili recipe I&#39;ve had! I served it up with Fritos, sharp cheddar, sour cream, and chopped green onions. Delish!"
5.0,Best and easiest white chili recipe.
5.0,I make this a lot … my kids and there friends come over and ask me to make this all the time ..
5.0,"I absolutely love this recipe. I&#39;ve tweaked it quite a bit. When I want a spicier chili, I exchange the green chilis for canned diced jalapenos. It&#39;s SO GOOD that way. I also add an extra 4oz can of green chilis/diced jalapenos to it every time I make it. It does not double well, but have made 1.5 times the recipe and it&#39;s great for extra large crowds/plenty of leftovers. It&#39;s a great snow day recipe, I&#39;ve made it 3 times these past 2 weeks!"
5.0,"Wow!!!  This recipe is excellent as written!!  The only change I made was that I used a 40 oz. jar of great northern beans.  It tastes so good, with just the right amount of heat!!!"
5.0,amazing! my boyfriend loved it so much! going to make it again this week!
5.0,"I have a very complicated white chicken chili recipe that I have made for years. Everyone raves over it. I saw this recipe and thought I’d try it as an easy alternative for weeknights. My husband likes this recipe better! Super easy and delicious! I did cut back slightly on the crushed oregano and cayenne pepper, otherwise I made it exactly as written."
5.0,Excellent! Both my guys (hubby and Dad) liked it !!I used almond milk and added a bit of shedded cheddar as I was a bit short on Velveeta.Will definitely make again.
5.0,"I used a full pound of ground beef and no Velvetta...cheddar cheese and 1/4 c. cream cheese instead.  It seemed to lack flavor until I added a pinch of red pepper flakes, some Worcestershire sauce and a good teaspoon of bacon grease.  I know, I know...but it needed something.  After those were added, it tasted great.  The next time I&#39;ll saute the vegetables in a bit of bacon grease and/or crumble some cooked bacon on the top.  Who doesn&#39;t love a bacon cheeseburger?"
5.0,"I have been making this soup since it was first published in 1996.   The only changes I make are to use a full pound of ground beef, and American cheese rather than Velveeta.   I also sometimes add more chicken broth to thin it out a bit.   Definite winner for my husband."
5.0,I loved it.  Only used half the cheese and 2% milk.
5.0,This was a terrific dish.  My entire family LOVED it.  I used full pound of hamburger instead of 1/2 pound.  
5.0,"This soup is one of our favorites! I make it often in the winter. If there are any leftovers, which is rare, I put it in individual servings in the freezer for a quick lunch. The only change I make is that I add a full pound of hamburger. The carrots, onions, and celery give the soup a great flavor. I thought the basil was different, but it is excellent in the soup. The amount of cheese is just right, as it is not overly cheesy. I will definitely keep making this soup!"
5.0,"This is one of our favorite soups.  So delicious!  And if there are any leftovers, they are just as good if not better than the first time around!"
5.0,Absolutely delicious!!! Perfect snow day recipe.
5.0,"So full of flavor!    I double the amount of cheese, onions and hamburger..."
5.0,"I have been making this very versatile recipe for a couple decades. My favorite version is replacing the potatoes with cauliflower pulled apart in similar size pieces with the stems cut up also, I chop up fresh parsley(1/4 to 1/2 cup), real cheddar instead of Velveeta,  replace burger with cubed ham but just as good without meat at all."
5.0,"Great recipe, but I think the skewers are a miss.  I get the pickle and onion connection, but not this way."
5.0,"Made this for the first time last week and it was absolutely delicious!!  I doubled the recipe and it was gone in no time.  I can&#39;t wait to take it to our next &#34;soup supper&#34; at my church.  I will make sure to have copies of the recipe with me, as I am sure that there will be many requests for it."
5.0,Sabrossimo!
5.0,The best cheeseburger soup ever!! I substituted homemade Velveeta for store-bought and white whole-wheat flour for the AP. My bunch demolished the entire pot so next time I&#39;ll double the recipe.
5.0,"Used small red potatoes, added and extra cup of broth, doubled the meat to 1 lb, and left off the carrots. Super yummy!!!"
5.0,"My family loved this soup, easy to prepared, the soup was full bodied, creamy and delicious. I normally do not use Velveeta in anything, but in this soup, it was perfect."
5.0,"As we prepared to spend the last part of a frigid Christmas Day watching our Steelers and Eagles play, I wanted something comforting and easy for dinner and this was IT!  Absolutely delicious.  Only adaptation I made was using beef broth instead of chicken broth because that is what I had on hand.  This has already been added to my recipe blog."
5.0,My friend shared this recipe with me a decade ago and it is still a family favorite. It is now a football favorite too! I make this to sell at our concession stand. It always sells out.
5.0,"Since I live alone, this makes a more soup than I can use at once. I didn&#39;t like it frozen.  I have found that if I make the base(NOT THE CHEESE) and freeze it into 2 or 3 bowls, I can then just thaw one of these, and add the cheese then."
5.0,"My family loved this soup! It was very filling and easy to put together. I used the frozen cubed hash brown potatoes which was a huge time saver. I too used beef broth and two cans cheddar soup since it was what I had on hand instead of velveeta.Quick, easy, and delicious!"
5.0,"I used this recipe as a guide.  I had to remove the carrots as some of family do not like cooked carrots, so I added corn instead.  I also added a tsp of Worcestershire sauce and 1/8 cup of red wine,  The alcohol cooks out leaving more of a rich flavor to the meat."
5.0,A staple in our home.  Freezes well and everyone loves it!
5.0,Try thickening soup with mashed potato flakes instead if flour.  Thats how I thicken my potato soup and cream of broccoli soup and this one! I always keep an extra pouch or box of mashed potatoes for this . Then there is no flour taste.
5.0,The best recipe  for this soup love it
5.0,"Great recipe!  The ingredients in this soup work together perfectly!  The carrots, onions, and celery are what give the soup a great flavor -- but still I made a couple of my own changes ...I&#39;m not a Velveeta fan so I used even amounts of cheddar and american cheese (any combination of cheeses you like would work) -- I used a pound of ground beef and as someone suggested I added just a splash of Worcestershire sauce --   This delicious recipe is a keeper!"
5.0,My family absolutely loves this soup! Perfect for cold winter days. It&#39;s very hearty and filling.
5.0,Always enough to share with somone else!!
5.0,"This is a great base for any type of cheese soup! I didn&#39;t have all of the vegetable ingredients to add, but I did have a bag of frozen broccoli, so I decided to mit the veggies in the recipe and instead make a Broccoli and cheese hamburger soup! It really was delicious and made plenty for everyone!"
5.0,We&#39;ve loved this soup! My husband who is not a soup fan raves over this recipe and he and our 12 year old will play fight for the leftovers! This makes a very generous helping. Oh it&#39;s even better the next couple days as leftovers. Warms up great!
5.0,"I made this for a girls/cousins get together yesterday. There was also chili, some spicy chicken taco soup and some corn chowder....this was the biggest hit"
5.0,"This soup is amazing!  We have leftovers in the frig right now.  You can double easily for a crowd.  I threw in a couple of handfuls of elbow macaroni, also.  I got it from my daughter&#39;s friend, Jill.  I sometimes pre-make the first part, waiting on adding the potatoes, until serving day.  Most of the prep work is done that way and you bring up to a boil, throw in potatoes, finish with the cheese, milk, etc!  Excellent!!"
5.0,I love this soup!  I like to add some chopped up dill pickle spears.  Really makes it taste like a cheeseburger!
5.0,Flexible! I skipped the carrots and celery cause I’m not a fan of those flavours and opted for mushrooms and broccoli instead. I used duck fat in lieu of butter and duck stock in lieu of chicken because that’s what I have. I used whatever cheese was in my fridge: left over taco mix and cheddar. It was still delicious! I love a recipe that’s easy to adapt. Thank you!
5.0,This is very good. I cut up
5.0,Made it for a gathering and received rave reviews from everyone!
5.0,"A favorite in our house!  I have been making it for years.  If I bring it somewhere, I have to share the recipe.  It&#39;s a keeper!  I sub out a little of the cheese for a spicy cheese such as pepper jack or hot habanero and add a little bacon."
5.0,I make this with cheddar not velveeta.
5.0,Just made this tonight.I&#39;m writing this between bites of my second bowl.The empty bowls from the kids says it all. Delicious. Period.
5.0,I have been making this for years and have received many compliments and requests for the recipe!!
5.0,I&#39;ve been making this soup for over 10 years.  It&#39;s delicious!  But my original recipe I printed from this website calls for 8 oz of Velveeta.  I think when it&#39;s made with more Velveeta it tastes grainy.  I also always use 1-1 1/2 lb of ground beef.  Usually I&#39;m cooking for a large crowd so it goes farther.
5.0,I followed the recipe as written. It was delicious ! A new family favorite.
5.0,"We loved this. I added a few dashes of Texas Pete hot sauce to give it a little more pizazze, but otherwise made as directed.  Will save and make again."
5.0,Love this soup and do share the recipe with everyone I serve it to. I find it&#39;s a great way to use up leftover pot roast.
5.0,Family loved the recipe and I served it in the Bread bowls from this site.  Thank you for sharing. We used reall cheese instead of the Velveeta.
5.0,"My kids loved this soup! I have to admit though, I did take a shortcut to make this a meal I could whip up after work. I substituted the prep work and cooking veggies with two cans of Veg-All. It was really good!"
5.0,Absolutely love this recipe.  So quick and easy to make.  YUMMMMMMMYYYYY
5.0,Yummy.....I  am a single senior lady so I cut it in half.  then I froze the rest for 2 more meals.  I also substituted White cheddar and Mozarella instead of Velveta.
5.0,This is great soup. It has everything in it my husband loves and he requests it over and over.
5.0,I made a double batch and my husband and I loved it!
5.0,I made this soup and it is yummy!
5.0,Definite Keeper!!! My family loved this soup and it will be made again.
5.0,I added bacon
5.0,I made this the other day and my whole family loved it. Thank you for sharing it!
5.0,"My husband and I loved this soup. I did make some adjustments though. I only put in 2 cups of potatoes instead of 4, and 8 oz. of cheese instead of 16. Excellent taste."
5.0,This is by far one of the most delicious soups I have made.  I didn&#39;t have velvetta cheese so used cheese whiz.  The sour cream makes the soup. Adds a nice finish to the already great soup.  I will make this often.  More of a meal than just a soup.
5.0,My family and I love this recipe so much I have shared it with my older sister and her granddaughter said that it was from Heaven.  Thank you  so much for sharing this recipe with us.
5.0,A new family favorite!!
5.0,Made this for supper tonight and it was delicious!! I plan on sharing this recipe with my grown daughters. I know my son-in-law will love it!!
5.0,I make quantities of this recipe &amp; freeze for Me &amp; Gifts...that&#39;s how good it is!
5.0,This is the best soup I have ever made.
5.0,This soup is excellent. It&#39;s quick and easy and very creamy. Will definitely make this again.
5.0,Very good soup and I will use the whole pound of ground beef and another 1/2 lb of Velvetta or other cheese that I may have on hand the next time around.
5.0,"I made this on a Sat. for 8 people.  19 yr. old grandson that doesn&#39;t eat veggies. ask if it had carrots in it!  He went back for seconds and ask on Sun. if there was any left that he could have for supper on Mon. night.  I didn&#39;t have basil or parsley so left out.  Used 8 oz. shredded Mexican chees and 8 oz. shredded co jack instead of Velveeta.  will be making this a lot this winter.    I used a full pound of hamb.  On Mon. I added a pint of home canned potato soup mix, a little more cheese and sour cream so we could have three bowls.  Potato soup mix is:  in a pint jar put  1/2 pint jar chopped potatoes, 1/4 pint sliced carrots, split the rest of the jar with a layer of chopped celery and chopped onions.  Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and fill with water.  Pressure can at 10 pounds for 20 minutes.  This makes a pretty jar for a gift also.  Put the instructions on it.To use heat soup mix with 1 Tablespoon butter or marg. and add one pint milk, check the salt and add pepper if you like.  Heat but don&#39;t boil.  If you need quarts just use the same proportions in a qt. jar with 1 teaspoon of salt and pressure at 10 lbs. for 25 minutes.  You can also can just can potatoes or add onions to the potatoes for the same amount of time.  These are handy to fry or add to soup."
5.0,This recipe is definitely one of my FAVORITE comfort foods! Always a hit for dinner.
5.0,I added sliced mushrooms and a zesty red pepper. DELICIOUS!
5.0,This soup is simply delicious! I served it with homemade rolls and my family loved it. Definitely to be repeated!
5.0,I took this to a family soup potluck.  It was a real hit.  All I took home was the empty crockpot.
5.0,This soup is absolutely delicious! My husband can&#39;t wait for me to make it again!
5.0,We loved this soup.  Great soup for kids cuz what kid doesn&#39;t love a cheeseburger?  This is just a cheeseburger in a soup!  I did cut the cheese in half!
5.0,"Really loved this soup!  Definitely appeals to our meat-and-potato eaters.I substituted cheddar and other cheeses we had on hand for the Velveeta and added it a bit at a time. Adding a bit of cream in with the milk gave it a nice, rich feel."
5.0,Delicious! I upped the broth since some thought it was too cheesy.
5.0,Excellent!!  The only change I made was substituted 8oz. Sharp cheddar cheese with 8oz Velveeta instead of all 16oz Velveeta. This one is a keeper.
5.0,This soup is amazing.  Very easy to make. I made mine exactly as the recipe called for.
5.0,Really yummy!! I used 1 lb. of ground beef to make it more filling. Will definitely make again.
5.0,I have been making this soup since I first saw the it in your magazine.  This is one of our family&#39;s favorites.  I do add extra ground beef and double the recipe now as my family has grown over the years.  I like to serve it with homemade bread bowls.  I am making it again today. Thanks for the recipe.
5.0,Wonderful!
5.0,This soup is rich and delicious. This is the second time I&#39;ve made this recipe and I have made a couple of additions. I use a pound of hamburger which is perfect for my family. We like a punch of flavor so I add a can of Rotel. I use the emersion blender and all it does is add flavor and it doesn&#39;t change the color. I fried some bacon and we added it as a garnish. Delicious!
5.0,Excellent! It&#39;s a meal in a bowl. i used a pound of ground beef. Makes it a heartier soup.
5.0,Excellent! We added some more velveeta and it was cheesy and awesome! Will definitely make it again.
5.0,"Made this tonight and it was delish.  Changed it by using a can of evaporated milk instead of the regular milk, used just over a pound of hamburger, 2 cans of chicken broth, 2 cups of shredded cheddar and 1 cup velveeta, and did not use the flour thickener.  It was very tasty and hearty.  Will make again."
5.0,"Making this for the 2nd time!! I switch things around though for my family. I use 2 lbs ground beef, garlic instead of onion, turkey broth instead of chicken. I also diced 2 green peppers. My taters are gold ones and smaller so I peeled diced 6. Topped with diced bacon before serving-adds a smoky flavor.We use this as a dip soup!! Mmm the best with scoop chips. I make for supper main night then put leftovers in qt canning jars.Hubs had this at a truck stop one time and says mine is hands down the best soup ever!!"
5.0,Delicious! Even the kids love it!
5.0,"So good I made homemade bread bowls to go with, this recipe knocks it out of the park! Love it!"
5.0,"Love - Love - Love this soup!!!  My family enjoys it as a meal - very hearty. Don&#39;t let the use of Velveta scare you, it really works well.  The recipe is wonderful as written, however I occasionally change things up for a slightly different taste.  My favourite is simply adding 1lb of ground beef (instead of 1/2 a lb) and a little Cajun Seasoning (Tony Chacheres).  Or a can of Rotel Tomatoes for Queso Dip flavour (kids really liked this)."
5.0,"just made this.....it is super delish. made few add- ins/changes: added a chicken bouillon (sp) cube and only 1/2 tsp sea salt, used 10 oz extra sharp white cheddar which I grated (only had 10 oz in fridge), plus I used 3/4 cup milk and 3/4 cup heavy cream.  crumbled bacon on top and added croutons. my hubby added swirl of ketchup and chopped pickles. so good. people that made this and say it has no flavor, put a bouillon cube in there. every soup I make I add a cube. I don&#39;t understand why ppl don&#39;t cook more with it, it adds flavor! just cut back on the salt that recipe calls for."
5.0,This soup is absolutely delicious and one of our family favorites. I do tweak this recipe to my family&#39;s taste. I also made this soup in our church kitchen for Wednesday night dinners and for special occasions serving our visiting ministers and it was definitely a thumbs up. I highly recommend this recipe.
5.0,"Don&#39;t skip the Velveeta, it makes this dish.  Velveeta has it&#39;s place and this is one of them.  Food snobs will disagree but it is their lose.  Made again and left out the potatoes and added chopped kosher dill pickle. Like this even better without the potatoes."
5.0,"This is for Phoebew1, why would you write a review never having made the recipe?! So you don&#39;t like Velveeta, use something else, doesn&#39;t take a rocket scientist."
5.0,This is one of our favorite soups!! I do a about a 1/4lb more beef though and you can season the meat any way that you like.  I use 2% velveeta and add jalapenos on the top of mine. So delicious!!!
5.0,Add some crumbled bacon and dice tomatoes that have been drained - absolutely yummy
5.0,Added the crumbled bacon and it was yummy.  This soup was a big hit with my crowd.  Will be making this many times over. Thnx.  P.S. Don&#39;t skip the Velveeta
5.0,"Excellent soup!  I was leery of using Velveeta, because I don&#39;t really care for it, but it did make the soup.  Even my teen-age daughter, who can&#39;t stand Velveeta tried the soup and loved it.  Next time, I would put more meat into it."
5.0,"Excellent recipe! Everyone was pleased with the outcome. I have been asked to make it again in the future. Great for a cold, blah day. This one is a keeper!"
5.0,"We love this soup.  I have to double it, it tastes even better the next day."
5.0,"I&#39;ve always wanted to make a home made soup, and I tried this recipe and it came out so good! My kids couldn&#39;t get enough of it. I even took left overs to my grandmother, who is THE cook in our family and she gobbled it up and loved it as well.  My kids are already asking when I&#39;m going to make it again."
5.0,Best soup we&#39;ve ever had and we really love home-made soups! EXCELLENT!
5.0,"This is our new favorite. We leave out the celery, but use canned potatoes which cuts down on the cutting time. We add a can of stewed tomatoes because a cheeseburger needs ketchup.  Right?  as many reviewer mentioned, this soup tastes even better the second day....if it makes it past the first."
5.0,"This soup is so good! Pure comfort food! We like a little more meat, so I used a pound of hamburger and replaced the Velveeta with VT white cheddar. I was low on milk, so used a whole can of evaporated milk instead, and omitted the sour cream. It had the right thickness for our liking. This is now in our regular meal rotation."
5.0,I  make this  soup in large  batches an everyone raves about It and ask for the recipe.   It freezes well so I always have plenty in the freezer and bring it out to serve with grilled cheese sandwiches.  When the weather get  cold!!!!!
5.0,"made the soup with a few modifications,. I used 1.6lbs. Of ground beef, 2_cartons of chicken broth, 1cup of milk, and half cup of heavy cream. This is the best soup that I have ever eaten, and my family loved it."
5.0,"Made this last night--was a hit.  Even my husband, who is not a soup fan, said it was good.  Will make again.  Could use more meat.  I skipped the sour cream.  Might try tomatoes next time, as others suggested."
5.0,Hey Edward - go get your seeing-eye dog and have him read the recipe for you - sour cream is the last ingredient listed!  This is a great recipe - soup is wonderful!
5.0,"Found the link to this in a Taste of Home email.  I have been making this recipe for many years exactly as written and wouldn&#39;t change a thing.  I got this recipe out of a taste of home magazine before taste of home had a website.  It is an absolute favorite of my families.  If I even make it to having leftovers, everyone fights over who gets to have it in their lunch box the next day.  One person asked if anyone has used anything other than Velveeta.  If you mean name brand vs non name brand then yes I have.  I have found that Velveeta has a much better flavor in the soup then the off brands that I have used."
5.0,I made this for dinner.  It was wonderful and tastes just like a cheeseburger!
5.0,I made this a couple of weeks ago minus the celery and it was wonderful... even the husband liked it. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.
5.0,"Well it was -50c here in Canada and today felt like a soup day! So I chose this recipe. I&#39;ve made this recipe a few times, it is a family favorite and the kids love it. This is the first time I&#39;ve garnished it with pickle slices. It&#39;s  even better with the pickles! We love this soup, thanks for the recipe!!"
5.0,I love this recipe.  The flavor is delicious.  To Madelyn below who wondered if anyone has used another cheese other than Velveeta.  I did.  I cubed up cheddar cheese.  I did not like it as well.  I didn&#39;t like the texture and the flavor was a little different.  I am sticking with Velveeta.
5.0,"Made this today for the first time. Went a more keto friendly route and used turnips instead of potatoes. Came out amazing. I saw several comments asking if anyone has tried using a different cheese. I switched velveta for 1 cup sharp cheddar, 1 cup smoked cheddar, 1 cup smoked Gouda and 1 cup gruyere. I don’t know how the velveta version tastes but this came out amazing!"
5.0,"I use some petite diced tomatoes too. As for Velveeta subs, no not a good idea but I do add some grated sharp cheddar in addition to but stir in at the end.  I skipped the dried herbs as well."
5.0,"I made this as-is with the exception of cutting the carrots in to chunks, and adding a couple of cups of Colby Jack cheese along with the Velveeta. Along with some nice dinner rolls, this was delicious!!! This time I used the measurements listed. Next time I’m going to double it so I can throw some in the freezer!"
5.0,"This soup was a big hit in our house!  I had 1 lb  of ground beef, so I doubled the recipe.  I only had 1-16oz. Velveeta cheese and approx. 6 slices of Kraft cheese slices, so I used that and thought that if I would have doubled the cheese, it may have been too cheesy for our liking. However, we did garnish our bowls with grated cheddar cheese.  I can&#39;t believe this is the first time in my life that I&#39;ve hat Cheeseburger Soup.  Thanks, Taste of Home!"
5.0,"Not sure why I waited so long to make this...IT IS SO DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe as directed, but used a whole pound of ground beef, a whole diced onion and a little less than half of a large brick (2lb size) of Velveeta. I also didn’t shred the Velveeta, but cubed it and it melted just fine. Added bacon crumbles for even more flavor. Will be adding this to my winter comfort food rotation...SOOOOO good!"
5.0,Wow!!!  I can see how this recipe got so many good reviews!!  My neighbor made this soup and shared it with me.  She followed the directions exactly ......  and I&#39;m glad she did!  I found this soup to me rich and flavorful with a nice consistency ......  and adding the sour cream at the end gives it a smooth and creamy texture.  When I make this soup I just might add some cooked and crumbled bacon ..... other than that.....  it&#39;s perfect!!
5.0,"Really enjoyed this, changed the cheese to cheddar and used 1% milk. Hubby really liked this. Will be definitely be making again."
5.0,Good soup.   Reminded me of beer cheese soup.  Family loved.
5.0,"For Clipnmom - 2 cups of cubed cheese measures volume, whereas the 8 oz. of cheese measures weight.  So eight ounces of cheese, cubed, should fill a 16 oz. measuring cup."
5.0,Good recipe but I don&#39;t like using processed cheese either so always substitute with some cheddar and a little cream cheese.
5.0,I follow this recipe exactly as written &amp; it&#39;s delicious every time!
5.0,"I made this soup last night, for the first time!  It was delicious, and it will be one I use again, and again.  I made some slight changes though.  I used fresh rosemary, and thyme instead of basil.   Really tasty.  I also used white cheddar, in place of velveeta cheese. In addition to those changes, I did not have sour cream on hand, so I made a basic rue, as a thickener!"
5.0,"I made this for lunch today and I have to say it is one of the most delicious soups I have ever made. Creamy, cheesy, potatoes and beef - heaven in a bowl!"
5.0,The soup was yummy and I paired it with garlic bread and a salad.I changed the recipe slightly. Added some garlic and extra cheese.
5.0,"This is a very tasty, easy soup recipe! I did make a few changes (for my preferences). Instead of ground beef I used ground turkey and instead of the Velveeta I used 4 ounces cream cheese and 8 ounces shredded sharp cheddar.  Because ground turkey really does not require draining I cooked the ground turkey and veggies all at the same time.  Also, if you like condiments on your burgers you can always squeeze a little bit into each individual serving (might be a great suggestion for making this recipe even more kid friendly).  I found that Dijon mustard works really well.  This will be a regular go-to recipe for me."
5.0,Great Soup! This was my first time making this recipe and usually I don&#39;&#39;t make adjustments the first go-around. I added 3 tsp of Dijon mustard and caraway seed.
5.0,Very good!  My kids even loved it!!!!  Not good for Diabetics though... :) However this is in the family recipe book now.
5.0,This has become one of my favorite recipes!!  It is very easy and absolutely wonderful!!!
5.0,Great Soup!  I gave some to my parents and my dad said &#34;Don&#39;t lose that recipe!&#34;
5.0,This Soup is &#34;Great Comfort Food&#34; for a Cold night.   I increased my Hamburger to 1 lb.   Used 1 cup of Heavy Cream in at the end.    And extra Velveeta Cheese about 4 oz. more.    Delicious.
5.0,This was a big  hit at Bible Study tonight.  I doubled the recipe.  Two guys went back for a 3rd helping.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Will definitely make it again.
5.0,This is a hearty and easy go to recipe for my family. Even my picky eater children like this. I substituted cheddar for velveeta and prefer the beef broth to the chicken broth after trying it both ways.
5.0,This soup is amazing. I will definitely make this again. The ideas in the other reviews are something I will try. You won&#39;t be dissappointed.
5.0,"I signed up just to rate this soup. By far the best cheeseburger soup recipe I&#39;ve tried. To say that it is a family favorite would be an understatement. My family, friends, neighbors, and co-workers love it. I added a couple of extra things, a little paprika and garlic, and it really hits the spot."
5.0,"I took this to our church&#39;s annual Chili Cook-off as an alternative for those who didn&#39;t want chili.  What a surprise when I won 2nd place!  People raved and were disappointed when the crockpot was empty!  I had not made it before, but my family says that this needs to be a staple in our meal rotations!  I track points with Weight Watchers, and even with the Velveeta, it only comes out to 9PPV.  Not bad for a hearty and satisfying soup!"
5.0,"Found this recipe a few years ago and since then I&#39;ve made it every year as a winter tradition meal! My kids would say this is their #1 favorite thing to eat of all time! My son even asks for it in the summer. Any time I ask what they want for dinner, his response for years now has been .. CHEESEBURGER SOUP!!!"
5.0,"I had to make this after seeing it in my email recently and reading several of the 476 reviews. There are many items I did change to make it lighter. Such as using 93% lean ground beef, using skim milk, omitting the sour cream. I chose to use real cheese (Colby and pepper jack) vs processed velveeta. I also decided make it in the crockpot 5 hours. We basically saut?ed up the meat, vegetables and made the roux then added everything except the dairy into the slow cooker and a half hour before serving placed the milk and cheeses in the crockpot. It turned out great. It is very creamy, flavorful ,and satisfying on a cold day."
5.0,Modified to a slow cooker recipe and this was truly amazing. I will be making this again!!
5.0,"Prepared with 1 lb. of grd. round.   Used half &amp; half instead of milk (thats what I had on hand)  used real cheese and did not use the sour cream.  Very creamy as is, and full of flavor. Perfect for the 3qt. saucepot."
5.0,"Absolutely delicious. I didn&#39;t have enough chicken broth, which is unusual for my house, so I used beef broth instead and it was delicious. My son who usually complains if I put celery in anything ate 2 big bowls and didn&#39;t even notice (I diced it very small). Thank you for sharing!!!"
5.0,This is a wonderful soup recipe!  I have made it multiple times over the years and it is always a big hit.
5.0,I made this for a work potluck last week and it was a hit!
5.0,This is an excellent meal!  I didn&#39;t change a thing in the recipe.  This soup is hearty and so very good just as written.  I&#39;ve made it for numerous potlucks and other occasions and the pot always goes home empty.  My son&#39;s friends say this is the best soup they&#39;ve ever tasted!
5.0,Absolutely wonderful.  My entire family loves this recipe and it will become a staple in my list of menu options.
5.0,Excellent!
5.0,"This is one soup everyone loved!  Great flavor, very filling.   A yummy recipe I need to keep!"
5.0,"Haha that this should be featured today...I have the ingredients on the counter waiting for this to be made tomorrow. I&#39;ve just been longing for &#39;soup&#39; weather and it&#39;s finally heading this way. It is one of the best soups ever. I do change it up now and again...this time I&#39;m using sharp cheddar instead of velveta. Sometimes I add bacon pieces. I&#39;ve tried it using frozen hash browns, but did not care for that flavor...some weird after taste. That said, it&#39;s a wonderful recipe written as is."
5.0,"This is one the best I have ever had. Next time I will ad 1/2 pd of ground beef and 1/2 pd of sausage.  I like It with a little more flavor.  I noticed Julieeee was going to use sharp cheddar.  I was wondering if it would be stringy instead of melting all the way.  But I see someone used it, so I will also try that.   I made it last year for 60 people at my Christmas party, they all loved it!"
5.0,"Why did I wait so long to try this. Excellent recipe as is, but I tweaked just a tad. I doubled the meat and added a little crumbled bacon (I like bacon cheeseburgers). I subbed extra sharp cheddar for the Velveeta because I always have it and never have Velveeta. I also used plain Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream (I didn&#39;t want to buy a whole carton of sour cream and a single serving of the yogurt worked perfectly). Thank you, Joanie Shawhan!"
5.0,Changed it up a bit myself.  Added bacon and used the bacon grease to make the rue.  Added 2 c milk (skim) and low-fat sharp cheddar cheese. Was delicious!!
5.0,"I&#39;m not a big soup person, but I love this soup!! I also added bacon bits, and since I hateVelveeta, I used Colby-Jack Cheese. Yummmm."
5.0,"This was fantastic!  I followed the recipe as it is given but doubled the batch.  I was afraid there wouldn&#39;t be enough that&#39;s why I doubled it but it made a lot.  It was delicious, very creamy and satisfying.  I will be sharing some of what&#39;s left with my mom and will have at least 2 more meals worth for the freezer."
5.0,"This has been a family favorite for years! I cut the Velveeta in half. And to make it simpler, I saute my vegetables then make my cream sauce on top of them all in the same pan.  So good! And healthy too!"
5.0,This Recipe is   RE- kick starting my LUV for soups..based upon what I just read.. My mouth is really watering for this ONE..
5.0,"My husband gave this 5 stars.  I made a double recipe and I changed it a bit.  It went against my cooking history to leave the ground beef with no seasoning, so I added a little garlic powder when frying and then a little salt after frying.  Then I used cheddar cheese instead of Velveeta Cheese.  Next time, I will use a cup or two more cheese.   I will definitely be making this in the future."
5.0,It tastes amazing and I have made it for family dinner for about three times and my family has loved it every time.
5.0,Delicious!  Love it!  Can it be frozen?  I didn&#39;t think so.
5.0,"love this soup. use tater tots bake nice and crispy and then cut them up and add to soup.  Also add 1 tbsp. of Ketchup, yellow mustard and dill relish. I use sharp cheddar and American to the soup instead of velvetta. Everyone I give it to raves about this soup. Secert a half tsp of worchershire sauce."
5.0,"Made this in the crockpot and it turned out delicious! Instead of velveeta cheese I just used what I had in the fridge, half a block of habanero cheese and about 1/3 a small jar of cheese wiz. Left out the sour cream."
5.0,Made this for our soup supper at church and everyone loved it!
5.0,"I love this soup; its one of my favourites.  I substitute ground chicken or turkey for the ground beef and I add garlic.  I have used different types of cheese, but the Velvetta works well.  These are just my own personal preferences.  Turns out great every time, no matter what type of cheese I use."
5.0,Loved it but used Cheddar instead of Velveeta.
5.0,I love this soup!  It&#39;s so cheesy and satisfying.
5.0,This is a family favourite
5.0,This cheeseburger soup is absolutely amazing. I first made this when my husband was doing chemo and radition treatments only thing he could eat even after his surgery he cant eat very well but this soup does the trick. I make it quite often and it jusy keeps getting better.
5.0,"Super!  It&#39;s -20 degrees today.  I knew soup would be perfect.  This was my first try and it was great!  Thanks for such simple, easy to follow instructions and a great recipe.  Loved it!"
5.0,I mixed half cheddar and half Velveeta (I didn&#39;t have enough Velveeta on hand).  Soup turned out delicious and I now get requests from the family to make it again and again!
5.0,"I use 4 slices bacon in place of butter, saute my onion in it, then sprinkle the flour over it cook slightly then gradually add milk and stir and add all ing., use leftover baked potato or microwave them, don&#39;t usually have velveeta so I use sharp cheddar or a mix of what I have,  no carrot, celery, or herbs or sour cream, add a dash of worcheshire sauce, set aside some cooked ground beef from another recipe  and it comes together very quickly, love this soup."
5.0,This is my most favorite soup ever!! Just the way it is!
5.0,"MMMMGood!!! I did add an extra 1/2 lb. hamburger.  I didn&#39;t even try it with the sour cream, because it was so&#34; GOOD&#34; already.  Also, it just get&#39;s tastier as leftovers!  Thank you for a very tasty soup during this very long, very cold winter!"
5.0,What a great soup. Printing up copies for friends. Make it per recipe and tweek to your taste. Easy to work with.
5.0,"Absolutely delicious! The only changes I made is that I didn&#39;t add celery (I just don&#39;t like celery, so I don&#39;t add it to anything.), and I used real shredded cheddar cheese instead of the processed stuff which is much better. It probably also made a difference that my broth was homemade. Yummy!"
5.0,"This is one of our favorites.  I use beef stock instead of chicken for a meatier flavor, but other than that, no real changes!!   And as a bonus, it freezes well, so I can make a double batch and freeze  it in single serve containers for lunches or quick dinners"
5.0,"This was delicious!  I did make a few changes.  I used 1/2 lb. ground beef, 1/2 pound ground Italian sausage, and I also threw in 1/2 jar of real bacon bits and added liquid smoke for even more flavor.  I used 4 cups of NY sharp cheddar instead of  Velveeta.  I also used garden vegetable broth instead of chicken broth since someone I was cooking for is allergic to chicken.  Very flavorful.  Will definitely make again!"
5.0,"This was fantastic. Like the others, I did make a few changes: Used a full pound+ of hamburger. Used Beef Broth (nearly 4 cups), not chicken broth. Used the pre-cooked frozen hash brown potatoes to save time. Added probably another cup of velveeta, plus a big handful of shredded chedder. CONS: Took at least an hour to cook with constant attention, it&#39;s not a quick meal. Even with the added beef, it barely served six of us (and that was with a homemade loaf of bread as a side for dipping.)"
5.0,"This is a perennial favourite.  I think the velveeta makes the soup tend to develop a skin on top if it cools at all, so I usually alter the recipe slightly by making a sauce of the flour, butter, milk &amp; real cheddar and then stirring it into the soup.  I have yet to find someone who doesn&#39;t like this."
5.0,Yummy! Even my picky non soup loving family member loved it.
5.0,This is awesome soup!  My husband requests it regularly.
5.0,"I made this last night for supper and it is a keeper.  I added cauliflower and broccoli also, and used two 14 oz cans of broth. It was not too cheesy .  I will make it again!  Hwniese"
5.0,"Delicious!  I left out the bayleaf, my kids don&#39;t like the taste, but it was still awesome!"
5.0,just finished eating it.  wonderful!  will definitely be making again
5.0,"I have made this many times and we love it.  It takes some time to prepare, but it is worth it."
5.0,"Made this for supper tonight  everyone loved it. Definitely making again. For those concerned about the sodium content you can use homemade chicken broth,use cheddar cheese instead of velveeta and unsalted butter."
5.0,"I made this last night for dinner and used red potatoes, also used Herbox chicken broth in place of regular chicken broth. Did not have celery in the house so just omitted that. Yum."
5.0,Wow. This soup is amazing.
5.0,This is often requested by family and at our annual soup event at church.
5.0,"My picky 3 year old just cleaned her bowl, it&#39;s a keeper!"
5.0,I just finished making this soup. My husband and I give it a thumbs up. Will try it out at work!
5.0,My family is still talking about this soup and I made it last week!
5.0,This is a nice hearty soup for a cold winter night.  My husband isn&#39;t a huge soup fan and he went for seconds.  I did change it up a bit because I won&#39;t use processed cheese.  I made the rue in a saucepan instead of small skillet and then added the milk to it.  I then added about 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese to the milk mixture and whisked it in so there where no lumps.  Then I added that to the beef and potato mixture in the 3qt saucepan.  I mixed everything together and then added another cup of shredded cheddar cheese.  I also added 2 tbsp. of Dijon mustard to give it more of a burger feel.  I also used reduced sodium broth and didn&#39;t add the added salt at the end of the recipe in order to keep sodium to a minimum.
5.0,Great Soup. Restraunt at home used it and did give out the recipe.  Said it came from Taste of Home.
5.0,"This is one of the first recipes I made from Taste of Home. My family loves it! It is easy to double using a large stock pot, since everyone went back for seconds. A little time consuming in the preparations, but it is well worth it! Leftovers? No way!"
5.0,Delicious soup.  My husband and grandson lived every last drop.  Served it with cornbread.  It is a new family favorite.
5.0,"I love this recipe and so does everyone that has ever had it!  I originally got this from a friend at work whose mother subscribed to TOH.  I have made this many times over the years, I use American cheese (cheese slices) , I didn&#39;t care for the velveeta in it,  So glad the recipes are all on here, makes it so much easier than searching though old magazines!"
5.0,The whole family loved it!! Best soup ever!!
5.0,Best soup ever!! And easy to make!! Loved it!
5.0,I would give this soup 10 stars if possible. I&#39;ve been making it since the recipe was first published in Taste of Home. Everyone who tries it raves over it.
5.0,This is our family&#39;s favorite soup. We have been making this often since it was first published in &#34;Taste of Home&#34; in 1996.
5.0,Love this Soup. Such a easy one to make when it&#39;s a fall/winter day.
5.0,"I made this tonight, and it was delicious.  I didn&#39;t have any sour cream but I had plain non fat greek yogurt, so I added that.  I used a full pound of hamburger, 4c of broth and 2c of milk so it would yield more servings for my family.  I also added some green onion at the end for garnish.  Overall, this is a great soup and I will make it again!! Oh, and it wasn&#39;t too cheesy either!"

5.0,"I made this tonight, and it was great! I did change the recipe a little though.  I didn&#39;t have any celery on hand, so I didn&#39;t include that.  I used a full pound of hamburger, 4c of chicken broth, 2c of milk, garnished with green onion, added broccoli, and used plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream because that&#39;s what I had available.  I was nervous about adding so much cheese, but it wasn&#39;t too cheesy at all--it was just right.  Will be making this again for sure!"
5.0,I used a whole pound of ground beef too. Great recipe and I will make it again.
5.0,Made this tonite &amp; thought it was delicious! Will use the whole pound of hamburger nxt time. Forgot to add the sour crm but it was still good! I will be making it again.
5.0,This recipe is a keeper! I use 1 pound of ground beef instead of the 1/2 pound in the recipe. I have never made this with carrots. The potatoes make it a very filling soup.
5.0,I just made this tonight and it taste great. I did add some pork sausage to it and it tasted great with it. This is a keeper
5.0,"This recipe is a family favorite! Also, I took it to a potluck gathering, and it was a huge hit. Great flavor! You won&#39;t be disappointed, so go ahead and give it a try!"
5.0,This soup has been a top favorite of our family of 8 since the first time I made it back in Oct. 1996.  Many of our kids choose it for their birthday meal entrée.  It&#39;s wonderful with a hearty bread that&#39;s good for dunking in the soup.  Also good with chopped up dill pickles--my personal favorite touch. :)
5.0,"Made it just as written. To extend the leftovers, I &#34;baked&#34; two potatoes, unpeeled, in the microwave, chopped them and 1/2 green pepper, and added them. I topped it with a couple slices cooked bacon."
5.0,I need to make this again soon. The family loved it!
5.0,Excellent! I made this for the Super bowl one time and my family loved it. I ended up leaving the salt and pepper out completely so everyone could add it to their taste and it still tasted amazing without it.
5.0,never made it.. ha ha on you
5.0,This was great. My family loved it.
5.0,"This is creamy and just like at the restaurant. I think I will cook the carrots, celery, and onion in some broth next time though. It seemed dry in the pan and when I served the soup the celery was still a little crisp. Otherwise fantastic. Easy to follow directions and very tasty!"
5.0,"This has been my daughter&#39;s favorite soup recipe since she was in 1st grade.  She is now 22, and STILL ask me to make it for her."
5.0,"I recall preparing this recipe when it was featured in Taste of Home and it was delicious! I&#39;d used 1 lb. ground beef, 3/4 cup SLICED carrots, 4 cups potatoes, peeled and cut in chunks, rather than cubed.  I used 1-1/2 cups Cheddar cheese, 1-1/2 cups milk or half and half cream &amp; used 1/4 cup Ranch dressing instead of sour cream. I found that the adjustments worked out for me!  Perhaps, dicing the potatoes IS better-I&#39;d chunked them, instead! At any rate, I really liked this recipe! If I don&#39;t have basil available, I&#39;ve used Italian seasoning instead! I really enjoy the blend of Italian seasoning anyway and have turned to it when I season dishes calling for oregano or basil!DELowenstein"
5.0,The first soup I make every fall when it finally gets cool!
5.0,I have been making this recipe for about 5 years it is one of my family&#39;s favorite&#39;s ..and the best thing you can add anything else for your own taste....
5.0,"What a hearty, yummy, easy put-ya-in-your-happy-place soup for a chilly night!  YUM!"
5.0,It was great!
5.0,"We enjoy eating this soup and don&#39;t adjust the ingredients, but on a lighter note-  it truly is hard to call it cheeseburger soup.  Who puts potatoes and carrots on their hamburger?"
5.0,i loved it.  I used ground turkey in place of the beef.  It stilled turned out good.
5.0,We have been making this since we found the recipe in the TOH ground beef cookbook. It is my absolute favorite soup recipe!! It is amazing!! So good and very filling! We have to double the recipe so we have leftovers!
5.0,Delicious.  I will continue to make this soup.
5.0,Very tasty soup and my kids and husband really liked it!
5.0,This was very good.  I will use a no salt broth next time though.
5.0,"My 9 year old daughter and I found this recipe while looking up what to make out of the ordinary with hamburger meat. She did most of it with me doing the cutting, and it was... Amazing! Probably the best soup I&#39;ve ever made and we were both hesitant at first before we started cooking it. We browned the meat with a half can of diced green peppers for a mild kick, and used baby red potatoes and I cannot wait to have leftovers again tonight!! We also made some homemade bread and stuffed a slice in each bowl and oh man it was wonderful!!"
5.0,I questioned some of the ingredients but it was fantastic! Should be called a Cheeseburger potato soup.  Tasted like I was eating a baked potato with a cheeseburger on top. The soup also looked like Queso dip which made my kids excited to eat it! :)
5.0,SOUNDS FAB
5.0,"I made this as a vegetarian dish, with Yves meatless ground (which is better than the frozen kind, and usually around $3 for a package that equals 1 pound of ground beef.)  Like others I also used cheddar in place of the velveeta, and since the meatless ground beef adds texture but not a lot of flavor I also added imitation bacon bits to add a little &#34;meat&#34; flavor.  It came out delicious, with a wonderful texture.  I will certainly be making this again!"
5.0,"This was easy to make and very tasty.  I used 1 pound of 93% lean hamburger, skim milk and all the rest of the ingredients as listed.  It was yummy and my hubby says it is a keeper."
5.0,This was so delicious!  Next time I make it I will double the recipe so that we have more leftovers.  I made it in the early afternoon and left it warming on the stove.  My boyfriend helped himself to a little bit all day so we only had 2 bowls leftover after dinner.  Have already made this twice and will definitely make again.  My boyfriend put some ketchup on his to make it taste more like a cheeseburger.
5.0,This a winner!  Only change I made was to dice potatoes a little smaller at family&#39;s request.
5.0,Super. I added 1/2 lb chopped bacon to mine. Have some xtra chicken broth in case you want it more soupy. Great recipe....will make many times over!
5.0,I made this for a Church supper and everyone thought it was great.  I used frozen hash brown potatoes.  The rue I made in the microwave in a large bowl and added the milk to that and melted the cheese before adding it to the soup pot.
5.0,my husband loved this soup! he said it was a keeper for sure. I did use 2% velveeta instead of regular.
5.0,Made this just as the recipe says and it was great.  Served it for company and everyone wants the recipe.
5.0,"I have made this recipe several times now, sometimes substituting ground turkey for the beef and it is still excellent. I also sometimes add bacon to it to make it a bacon cheeseburger soup!"
5.0,"Awesome! Here are some changes we did to the recipe:- 1/2c carrots...will do 3/4c next time- did not peel potatoes- Replaced velveeta with an 8 oz block of pepper jack, shredded...Really gave it a kick!Served with hot fresh homemade potato bread :)"
5.0,"Excellent!I keep the skin on the potatoes. Instead of Velveeta (we are not big fans), we used Pepper Jack Cheese, shredded. It really gave this soup a kick!I also reduced the salt and used 1/2tsp pepper. Keeper!"
5.0,Absoultely sensational. I LOVE this soup. And I am not a big soup eater.
5.0,"I got this same recipe 10 years ago and instead of ground beef o have used bacon, ham, and even venison. comes out great every time and i am expected to make it on holidays with my inlaws. careful on salt if you use ham or bacon and get rid od grease id you use bacon or ham."
5.0,This soup is so easy and my family loves it!  My 5 year old rarely eats leftovers but has eaten this one 3 times since the first night I made it!
5.0,This is one of my go-to soups. We make a double batch and freeze the left overs. Makes a good make-ahead meal. Love it!
5.0,"I made this soup recently for a family gathering and everybody loved it! I received lots of compliments and recipe requests! I doubled the recipe and used lean hamburger, Velveeta made with 2% milk, 2% milk and light sour cream- very tasty."
5.0,"simple and delicious, most ingredients i normally have, I&#39;ve made this before with sliced and shredded cheese(whatever I had in the fridge) and it came out great"
5.0,One of the best soups I&#39;ve eaten.  I&#39;m sure I will make it often.
5.0,"My newest favorite soup.  Just gotta be careful when making the rue (butter with flour).  If you overcook it, the recipe won&#39;t turn out right.  Like others said, it wasn&#39;t hard to make at all.  Helps to use the food processor for the veggies for quicker preperations."
5.0,My family couldn&#39;t stop raving about this soup. I didn&#39;t have celery so I left it out. We will definitely make it again.
5.0,"Made this recipe pretty much as written (except for no sour cream because I forgot to pick some up) even though I am not usually a fan of Velveeta.  It was hearty and had a good, rich flavor that both my husband and I enjoyed.  Definitely a keeper!!"
5.0,"This soup is awesome. I made a few changes because my husband likes a heartier soup.  I doubled the burger, added bacon and used beef broth instead of chicken broth.  It came out amazing!  This is a keeper!!!"
5.0,"Love!  Made a version for a soup contest and got 2nd.   I would recommend sticking with the lower amount of Valveeta, adding a cup of pepper jack cheese, and adding nearly a cup of chicken broth."
5.0,The best soup ever!
5.0,family favorite!!! i use a whole pound of ground beef.
5.0,"We love it, Thank you! I did make some adjustments... I only had shredded Mexican cheese on hand and beef broth so I used those instead of chicken broth and Velveeta. I also didn\&#39;t add sour cream. My 4 kids from 13yrs-4yrs all loved it . We will make it again! Thank you!"
5.0,Incredible soup! I cannot believe how good this is. I used leftover taco meat and something about those taco spices in the soup put this over the top!!!!!!
5.0,My family absolutely loves this recipe!
5.0,This fantastic soup is a favorite of my whole family and anyone serve it to. A little labor intense but soo worth it.
5.0,I made this last night. It was so delicious that I had the leftover for brunch! The only thing I did differently was add a can of drained green beans to it because I didn&#39;t have any celery. Can&#39;t wait to make it again!
5.0,"I am not a big soup fan, but I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this soup! It takes a little time to prepare, but it is so very worth every minute!"
5.0,I absolutely loved this soup. So easy to make and it contains ingredients I typically have on hand. I did use a full pound of ground beef but didn&#39;t change anything else. Delicious!
5.0,This soup got rave reviews from my hungry hunters last night.  To shorten up the prep time I have used hashbrowns and frozen celery/onion/carrots.  We garnished it with shredded cheddar and crispy bacon. Definitely a keeper recipe.
5.0,Our whole family loves this recipe...love when the cooler weather gets here so I can get back to making it!!!  Wouldn&#39;t change a thing!!
5.0,"The best soup I have ever made. Cheesey, beefy, potatoey goodness."
5.0,We&#39;ve been cooking this soup for over ten years now and we still get request for it at every family get together. Prep takes a little bit of time but oh so worth it!!
5.0,"Absolutely yummy!  Doubled the beef and cheese and 1 1/2 times the broth to make a bigger batch.  Also, cooked it slow in my crock pot for 4 hrs."
5.0,"I read some of the other reviews so I added some diced tomato&#39;s and cayenne powder to give it a kick.  Really, thick, rich soup that sure works on a rainy, winter night!"
5.0,I&#39;ve been making a variation of this for years.  My husband loves it.Tip:  it&#39;s way easier to add the extra butter and then the flour to the celery and onion mixture than it is to make a separate roux.  You have more control over how thick your soup will be and you don&#39;t have to mess up an extra pan.  It&#39;s an extra step that&#39;s very unnecessary.
5.0,"I have been making this soup for years and years.  It is a family favorite and gets rave reviews from everyone who has had it!  Try it, you will LOVE it."
5.0,"I wonder when this poter came up with this recipe. Becuase I have the exact same recipe I got from a cook book that is at Least 20 years old.Yes it is a gret soup, but this seems to me as if it is copied."
5.0,this was perfect!!! family loved it!! next time i will double the recipe!!
5.0,"great soup! I followed the recipe exactly, but then ended up adding a tsp of dijon mustard at the end for a little kick."
5.0,This soup was excellent!  I couldn&#39;t wait for my husband to ghet home from work...I had a small bowl at 2:20 in the P.M.
5.0,I have made this soup for years - it&#39;s still a favorite of my kids - my son continues to request it when he comes over for a meal. I make a big batch so that we can have leftovers in the fridge for a couple of days afterward. Hearty and delicious!
5.0,I used a whole pound of ground turkey and 2 whole cans of chicken broth plus a half can of water. Otherwise I did the recipe as written and it was excellent!!!  Everyone liked it and it was very hearty. Will make it again.
5.0,Everybody loved it.
5.0,"I found the recipe while waiting in the dentist office years ago.  My family loves this soup.  My children are grown now, so at Christmas each year I make some of their favorites and freeze them as gifts.  Big Winner."
5.0,"I&#39;ve been making this for many years.  My kids grew up eating this and they still love it today!  The only change I&#39;ve made is that I use American cheese from my deli, because I prefer it&#39;s taste.  Wonderful comfort food!"
5.0,"I&#39;ve had this recipe in my file for years, and made it again the other night.  My entire family, even the complainers about soup, love this recipe.  It&#39;s fairly easy to make and very hearty.  I use ground turkey instead of ground beef and it&#39;s delicious.  Glad to rediscover it and will be making it more frequently."
5.0,This may not have been the quickest soup to throw together but it was well worth it. I can&#39;t wait to make it again. I used 1 T. each fresh parsley and basil and I used the whole pound of hamburger which was the right amount compared to the amount of potatoes.
5.0,This is terrific my whole family loves it!
5.0,"Have made this recipe about 4 times already in the past few months, its a family favorite! Followed the recipe exactly and it has been perfect. Like comfort food in a soup!"
5.0,Delicious soup! I skipped the basil and added chopped green chile. Now my hubby&#39;s favorite soup! Thanks for sharing the recipe!
5.0,Delicious soup! I skipped the basil and added chopped green chile. Now my hubby&#39;s favorite soup! Thanks for sharing the recipe!
5.0,Sooo yummy!
5.0,"I make this often, wonderful flavor.  My 3 and 5 year old grandkids were over and couldn&#39;t get enough of it."
5.0,I have been making this soup for over 10 yrs. It is a favorite with my family!
5.0,"This was a fun soup to serve, everyone added their favorite condiments.  It was very thick so I added an extra cup of chicken broth and skipped the flour.  Also, I did use 1# of burger which made it thicker."
5.0,"I make this regularly for my husband and I, and occasionally for a potluck.  Everyone raves about it.  I frequently add a cup or so of cheddar, but we really like cheese here.  Love it!"
5.0,"Love it!  I make it for my family, and occasionally for a work potluck.  It always gets rave reviews.  Sometimes I add a cup of cheddar to it - we like it cheesy here."
5.0,"I made this for our family of six last night.  It doubles well, but takes longer than the given times.  All of my children ate it without complaining which is a huge achievement.  Three of them gave it compliments.  I added some petite frozen peas (partially defrosted) at the end of the cooking time to add some more veggies to our meal.  I think that it is a new favorite."
5.0,"Really good, my picky grandkids even liked it. I doubled the recipe and served two families."
5.0,I make this soup quite frequently. It&#39;s one of our favorites!
5.0,"I added another cup of broth and 1/4 tsp grd. red pepper. Very good, even my 18 yr old grandson loved it."
5.0,Nice one..I liked the recipe!!
5.0,All the chopping and pre-cooking of the hamburger could be done a day ahead.  Gave my husband a big bowl for lunch; he came back for more!  We love this soup and will definitely be making it again!  Would also be good to take to a sick friend!  Wonderful recipe!
5.0,"Our whole family loves this recipe. I am making it again today. Our children get to choose what I make for dinner as a part of their birthday celebration, and you would hardly believe the elaborate meals I&#39;ve had to prepare in the past. This year, my son didn&#39;t hesitate for a second before he said, &#34;Cheeseburger soup!&#34; That&#39;s pretty high praise!"
5.0,This soup is so good I have to be careful not to make it to often
5.0,"This soup was so easy to make and I had most of the ingredients on hand.  I changed a few things only because of what I had on hand.  I used 1 pound of ground beef instead of a half pound.  I used 3 cups of potatoes instead of 4 cups.  And I used beef broth instead of chicken broth.  I made bread bowls to serve the soup in.  My husband, sister and 5 year old niece loved this soup."
5.0,LOVE IT!! Pretty much followed the directions except I used the white queso Velveeta instead of the regular. My husband went back for 3rds! My daughter (who hates cheeseburgers) loved it and said that she wants it again and again. I&#39;m from Wisconsin as well so this super cheesy soup is right up my ally! Thanks so much for sharing it with us Shawhan!
5.0,I have made a version of this for years. It is a family favorite and I have served it to company and the also loved it. It&#39;s a fast and easy recipe to make and I always make e.ougj for leftovers
5.0,"I&#39;ve made this twice now. The first time according to recipe but used real WI cheese. Don&#39;t do celery because my daughter doesn&#39;t like it. The second time, I added more hamburger, a bit of minced garlic and a lot more grated sharp cheddar. We love it!"
5.0,"I enjoy learning from other people who really can cook,  unlike me, just following recipes.  I have learned a lot from people who find a recipe and alter it before even trying it.  I have tried to do that here.   I substituted chicken for the beef, margarine for the butter, used a no-salt version of chicken broth, cornstarch for the flour, tofu for the Velveeta, skim milk instead of whole, did not add any salt, and used cultured buttermilk instead of sour cream.  My family has decided that I can have it all to myself.  It&#39;s their loss.  Thank you for this recipe."
5.0,"This recipe is popular for very valid reasons. I doubled it and fed my family of 5, ages 55 to 12, some of them VERY picky eaters, and EVERYONE loved it. Even the leftovers were consumed.  It is simple to make. The ingredients are readily available. I have to admit it isn&#39;t the healthiest dish I make. But every once in awhile, for us, consuming things like this in moderation is the key. For my family this fits the comfort food category."
5.0,I made this soup for dinner tonight and am very pleased at how it turned out! I followed the recipe ingredients exactly except I didn’t thicken the soup with the flour mixture. I didn’t use it because then my gluten free son in law can also eat it. It was still a very nice consistency. I also used half velveeta cheese and half Cooper sharp just because I already had some to use up. I also doubled the meat. It is delicious!
5.0,"I&#39;ve made this soup twice in the past 10 days! My family loves it. I added more meat for our liking. I used about 1.25 lbs of (very lean) ground beef. I increased the broth to 4 cups, the milk to 2 cups and used half a large (I think a 2 lb brick) container of Velveeta. Hubby suggested adding some bacon which sounds fabulous."
5.0,"This is hands down our favorite soup! We have been making this recipe for a few years now, but we make it a tad bit different. We use sausage instead of ground beef and the flavor is absolutely amazing! We do everything else the same, except using the entire block of velveeta. We eat it with french bread and it&#39;s the best!"
5.0,"I made this hamburger soup and it was the best soup I have ever (and I do mean &#34;ever&#34;) tasted. Forget the leftovers, there won&#39;t be any unless you double it and freeze some for later."
5.0,"Gads! How good is this!  Forgot the sour creme, still awesomeness! I added some roasted garlic powder, and bacon for topping. House smells amazing, and the taste is incredible.  Thank you."
5.0,This soup is fantastic.  I Increased the sour cream to1/2 cup and used the max amount velveeta suggested.  Omg it was good
5.0,"Excellent, everyone in the family loved it!"
5.0,"This is by far my favorite soup.  I did make some changes to make it less fatting.  I use turkey burger instead of beef burger and cook the onion, celery and carrots with the meat, ommiting the butter.  I used skim milk, and 2% Velveeta cheese and thickened it with cornstarch and cold water.  I also use fat free sour cream.  I have made this soup several times and it is sooooo good."
5.0,This soup is so flavorful.  With some crusty bread it was the perfect meal for us.
5.0,"This was a super tasty soup that my WHOLE family enjoyed (Hard to do when you have a Carnivore, an Herbivore, and an Omnivore at the same table)  I added bacon to it and it was delicious. Will definitely be making this again."
5.0,Just want to say I like buzzbombz suggestions. keep up the good work.
5.0,Awesome!  Kids loved it! Highly recommend!!Used bacon in it and it was great...kids asked for seconds!
5.0,This is my second time making Great recipe - The only thing I did different was adding hot sausage with the hamburger. I would make again. this is a keeper
5.0,This is really good. I added a can of drained diced tomatoes...left out the salt. The Velveeta has enough for us. YUM
5.0,Excellent!! Excellent!! Excellent!!  Made this for my household and the neighbors and all six people raved about it!! Will definitely make it again!!!!
5.0,"Second time I have made this soup and its excelent, my family loves it. I used ground deer meat this time,"
5.0,"Made this  hearty and tasty soup for the first time tonight.  I made the following changes and it turned out delicious.  Increased the meat to 1 #, increased  the onions, carrots and celery to 1 cup each,  slightly increased all the remaining ingredients except for the salt which I decreased to 1/2 teas. , used low sodium chicken broth, used 1/2 shredded cheddar and 1/2 velveeta cheese .  It&#39;s a bit of work and makes a large batch, but it&#39;s good!"
5.0,I made this recipe as is but for my second bowl I added ketchup &amp; mustard and it was delicious - definitely tasted like a cheeseburger!
5.0,I have been making this recipe for years and my family loves it!  I add a 2 large cloves of chopped garlic to give it a garlic burger taste
5.0,I have been making this soup for quite a few years and continue to receive raving comments when serving it to guests. It has great flavor when reheated too!
5.0,This was outstanding. Great comforting soup.
5.0,Excellent flavor and texture.  Nice spices. Simple ingredients. It becomes more creamy as you stir it. The potato cubes become mashed.
5.0,"Wouldn&#39;t change a thing.  Not quick and easy but well worth the trouble.  I made cream sauce with flour, milk and butter, then added the cheese, then added that to other ingredients.  Whole family loves it."
5.0,This is excellent but I added a minced jalapeno and made it spicy cheeseburger soup!
5.0,"I&#39;ve made this soup twice &amp; both times it was a huge hit!  Everyone loved it, including me."
5.0,"@ buzzbombz,  why would you give it 4 stars and then post a different recipe?  You should just review this one and then submit your own separately.  ??"
5.0,Cooked again. It is very tasty like usually!
5.0,ABSOLUTELY delicious!  This is my family&#39;s new favorite soup!  I didn&#39;t have celery either and it was still so tasty!  I added 1 tsp oregano and 1 tsp thyme for extra flavor:-)
5.0,Sooo good!  I used more cheese and onion and meat.  Everyone loved it!
5.0,Easy to fix and absolutely delicious! Will definitely make this again
5.0,This soup is wonderful!  I did use ground turkey instead of ground beef! I also did not add salt because there was a lot of salt in the cubes that I used for the chicken broth. I love it!
5.0,This soup was awesome!!! My family loved it. Great flavor and very filling.
5.0,Just made it for the second time and it&#39;s absolutely great.  I didn&#39;t use as much cheese but I followed the recipe the rest of the way.   An Excellant soup.
5.0,I have made this soup for the family and for church events; everyone loves it from kids to the elderly.
5.0,"Delicious.... Especially on a cold day, sitting around watching football!!  Big hit with my kids!  It&#39;s a keeper!  Definately would make again!"
5.0,"My family LOVED this soup. We all added hamburger pickle slices to our individual bowls and it gave it a whole new flavor, fantastic!"
5.0,Great recipe!  Made almost exactly as written (left out the sour cream since it was already so creamy). My husband and I both loved it and can&#39;t wait to make it again.
5.0,My entire family loved this recipe. They usually don&#39;t like much so that is a huge compliment!
5.0,"Absolutely Fantastic!! Followed the recipe exactly, it was really delicious.  Definitely will make again."
5.0,"My family just loves this delicious, hearty and creamy soup!!!  I make a double batch and freeze it for lunches."
5.0,"I made this recipe for my husband and while already delicious, he had the genius idea of adding diced pickles to the soup.  OH BOY that took the soup to the next level.  The pickles made the soup taste like a cheeseburger in a bowl.  SO GOOD!"
5.0,"This is a KEEPER! Everyone in my family loved this soup, even my hesitant husband. I doubled the recipe and it turned out amazing. Shared it with friends and family and they also agree that it&#39;s a keeper."
5.0,We LOVE this!  My husband asks for this over and over so I usually make a double batch and we freeze containers for later.
5.0,"We have been offering this for many years in our school concession stand. I think if we stopped, there’d be a riot! The commenters on this site have become more vicious over the years. If you don’t like a recipe, then give it one star and move on."
5.0,We love cheeseburger soup! The potatoes and cheese make this very good.
5.0,Yum!! Mmm good!!  I have been making this for about 8 years and it is always a winner when I make this.  My friend you doesn’t eat cheese looks forward to when I make it. Have never had anyone turn this away. It is a very hearty soup and fills you up. If you have any left it freezes well.
5.0,"First time I made this, I found the Velveeta made it a little thicker than I was expecting, so I made two adjustments kicking the beef up to a full pound and using 8 ounces of apple wood smoked gruyere cheese instead of the Velveeta.  The end result was a submission to the food service at work&#39;s annual soup and chili contest with a first place win in the soup category and a rotating place on their menu for the past winter season.  It was so popular that it has become a fixture on the menu every third Friday and almost a year later still always sells out!!"
5.0,"Absolutely delicious! I did tweak it a bit by adding 2 tsp ground mustard and 1/4 tsp cayenne, and since we don&#39;t eat Velveeta I substituted sharp cheddar. I will definitely make it again. Thanks!"
5.0,"Everyone in my family raves about this recipe. Even when I double the recipe, I rarely have many leftovers."
5.0,Why do people rate something one star be ause they don&#39;t like the ingredients?
5.0,This is like the BEST soup.  My family will request it every time they get.   One year my son was having a pot luck day at school and insisted that he bring this soup.    It was a BIG hit.    I have added bacon for a change and added pepper jack cheese.
5.0,"Made this twice now. Used one pound of ground beef, 2% milk, and shredded sharp cheddar cheese the second time and I think this made the flavor better."
5.0,This is an awesome recipe. Have made it many times. I also have the cookbook that it first came out in. I usually double the recipe so I can have leftovers. Have used frozen hash browns when I&#39;m in a hurry.
5.0,I have made this recipe for over ten years and everyone always asks for the recipe. I also got the recipe from the 1997. cookbook.
5.0,"Amazing!! I never liked potato soup until this. It always seemed bland before,but this recipe is flavorful and yummy! I did add a little red pepper flakes because we like everything spicy. I also added a can of mushrooms because my husband like sauted onions and mushrooms on a burger."
5.0,Take a little of time to get the ingredients ready but it is well worth the time.  It is a very yummy and filling soup.  My husband gives it a thumps up and wants me to make it again.

5.0,Made this for dinner last night!  Best soup ever!  My family loved it and can&#39;t wait for me to make it again!

5.0,Wow! Very good but I put less butter and cheese another way it will be very buttery and cheesy! Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5.0,"I have made this often.  Saw an episode of Diners, Drive ins, and Dives where a restaurant served something almost exactly the same.  They put some fresh chopped iceburg lettuce and fresh chopped tomatoes in the bottom of the bowl BEFORE putting the soup in.  Sounds weird, huh?  Know what?  IT&#39;S AMAZING!!  Try it!  Oh, and top the soup with some croutons! So good!"
5.0,"Myself, mother and extended family makes this soup.  We all love it.  I use Kraft singles and add cooked bacon."
5.0,One of the best hearty soup recipes ever.  Great when the weather turns cool.  We serve it with my Mom&#39;s homemade buttermilk biscuits and everyone loves it.
5.0,I&#39;ve been making this recipe for years. It&#39;s a family favorite especially during those chilly fall and winter months.  The only change I make is that I use a full pound of ground beef. This hearty soup along with some dinner rolls or other bread and you have a wonderful meal!
5.0,awesome taste! i used leftover taco meat from the night before and added 1/2 cup of mixed veggies because I only had one baking potato to use.
5.0,My Husband does not like soup very much but he loves this recipe!
5.0,This dish is absolutely delicious! I didn&#39;t change a thing about it and I received more compliments from this recipe than anything I&#39;ve ever made.  I made a batch and took it work where they were just about licking their bowls!
5.0,Love this soup It is my kids favorite.  I even had to write it down for my son when he got married.
5.0,I have been making this for years. This my husband&#39;s favorite.
5.0,Excellent soup - I use instant potato flakes to thicken it.
5.0,"I am not a soup person, and I love this soup. I can&#39;t wait to have it the next day for lunch. It is really good fresh and left over. I do use a full pound of ground beef and try to use healthier ingredients, such as 2% Velveeta, low-sodium chicken broth, and fat-free milk. It is delicious and the extra sodium/fat is not missed."
5.0,"I have the cookbook that this recipe is in from 1997.  We LOVE this recipe.  I have substituted a few things (cheddar cheese for the velvetta - if you do substitute, add more salt - I think it needs a bit more salt even with Velvetta.  And I cut up Red Potatoes and leave the skin on.) and make it so often I don&#39;t even measure anymore, but always a hit.  I love the leftovers for my lunch the next few days.  So good with some biscuits!"
5.0,"Loved this.  It is not a soup you can through together after work, but it doesn&#39;t taste like that either.  Tastes like Grandma would have made.  Loved it!!!!"
5.0,This is one of our favorite soups.  Thanks you for this great recipe.  We make this at least 3 times a month.
5.0,"Love this soup! Hearty and Delicious!I did tweak it a little. 1.5 cups beef, extra  2c. broth, 2c. gourmet blend of shredded cheese instead of velveeta.  1/2c extra sour cream.I basically increased the size of the recipe and used shredded cheese instead of velveeta. Yummy! My kids love it."
5.0,"I made this recipe for our family of three and we ate it two nights in a row -- that&#39;s how much we all loved it!  I didn&#39;t add the sour cream, so it came out v-e-r-y cheesy, which was perfect for us!"
5.0,Fantastic! This was added to my family&#39;s &#34;10 top&#34; list!
5.0,WOW!!! Such a great soup. The husband and 3 very picky teens loved it. Will make this again. So worth the time.
5.0,WOW!!! Such a great soup. The husband and 3 very picky teens loved it. Will make this again. So worth the time.
5.0,It needs something to make it a little zippy. Next time I may add some peppers and mustard.
5.0,It needs something to make it a little zippy. Next time I may add some peppers and mustard.
5.0,Great recipe.  Cut the potatoes in small pieces.  I cut mine in large chunks and that messed up the texture.  That was my fault and I will correct it in the future.  Other than that don&#39;t change a thing.
5.0,"I must admit the first time that I saw this recipe, I thought no way... but tried it anyway.  My husband &amp; I have had this twice already.. It is SO Tasty &amp; not at all as heavy as I thought it would be!! I would definitely recommend this soup."
5.0,I have made this several times and we love it.  It have become one of our grandchildren&#39;s favorites.

5.0,This is my one of my favorite soups! I usually double the recipe when I fix it. I serve this at least 1-2 times during the winter months. Kids of all ages love it.
5.0,"Very quick and EASY recipe.  I had to change up some of the recipe, but was still fantastic!  I substituted a few items for things I already had at home: Beef Broth instead of Chicken Broth, I used real Mayo instead of sour cream, and I diced baby carrots instead of grating them."
5.0,This is a favorite at our church functions.  Have made it many times.  Absolutely love it!
5.0,I Love this Soup! I first made this last year for a soup pot luck and Mine was the one all gone at the end. Several people wanted the receipe. I make this all the time in the winter. Kids love this soup too! I omit the celery cause I hate celery. by shredding the carrots you don&#39;t even know they are in there by the time it&#39;s all cooked. Great way sneaking healthy foods in..
5.0,"This soup has great flavor. I didnt even add any of my own seasonings to it which is something that I almost always do, I thought it seemed a little thick so I added about 2 cups of water when boiling the veggies and potatoes and then I also didnt include the sour cream. Great recipe!!"
5.0,"This soup is amazing. I used half and half instead of milk, omitted the sour cream and the celery. It was perfect and I am making it again this minute!"
5.0,"Very good!  I used 1 lb ground beef, 1 med. Onion chopped, 1 large Carrot shredded and the 1/4 tops out of 4 Celery sticks including the leaves chopped."
5.0,"I have never written a review before - so that goes to show you what a BIG HIT this soup is in my home. My young boys love it, and it&#39;s one I make for guests as well. Thanks for the great recipe!"
5.0,"Two granddaughter were here for the week-end ages 13 and 16. We all loved it. 13 year old asked me to make it for her birthday and suddenly remembered her birthday is past this year, so she said I mean for Christmas. LOL  I left out the mushrooms but the package of ground beef that I had thawed out was a little over 1 pound and it was wonderful. Thank you"

5.0,"I think I will use a reduced sodium Velveeta next time I make this soup.  I have an older version of this recipe that does not include potatoes, parsley nor flour, but 2 cups of cooked rice instead. Even though the rice was ok, I will make this recipe again, but instead of the rice, I&#39;ll use the potatoes. I&#39;m looking forward to posting about this version!"

5.0,I used 1 lb. of ground beef and American processed cheese slices instead and it worked out great since my family enjoys more beef in their soup.  I have been making this recipe since it came out in the magazine many years ago!  LOVE IT and share it with many people!  It&#39;s always a favorite that is requested at our Lenten Dinners at Church each year.

5.0,"This is so good!!! I did 1 pound ground beef, didn&#39;t measure the veggies or seasonings (just did as much as I liked), added more seasonings, left out the salt, and I used process cheese slices-maybe use a little less cheese slices next time. And I didn&#39;t add the sour cream. So yummy!"

5.0,The best soup ever!
5.0,Fantastic! This was added to my family&#39;s &#34;10 top&#34; list!
5.0,"First time making this. I used a can of cheddar cheese soup and 2% milk and just used a dollop of sour cream in the bowl if anyone wanted it. It didn’t take long to make, was easy and we loved it."
5.0,"We really liked this soup, especially on a cold fall day. Next time I will double the beef and half the potatoes."
5.0,Just made this for the first time and my family loved it.  I omitted the carrots and added some jalapeno&#39;s to give it a little kick.  I also used frozen potatoes which saved time.  Doubled the batch and it&#39;s going fast!
5.0,Loved this recipe!!!! Huge hit . I mixed up the cheeses and it was amazing. Will make again. Absolutely love this soup. So easy and fillling ??????????
5.0,"One of the absolute best soups I have made yet and I make soup every Sunday. No doubt this will be gone in the next few days. I added 5 cups of chicken broth instead, 2 cups of milk and I doubled the ground beef as others suggested. Turned out fantastic !"
5.0,"I recall making this soup back when I was first getting the Taste of Home annual recipe books! However, I&#39;d used sliced carrots, potato CHUNKS, Cheddar cheese, milk, and instead of sour cream, I&#39;d used  Ranch dressing. I used 1 lb. of ground beef!  (I&#39;d checked my logbooks of reviews and I don&#39;t recall rating this recipe 12/13/2020!)"
5.0,It took a while for me to get my husband to even try a spoon of this soup.  He loved it.  It is his most requested soup.   Easy to make and easy too change up if desired. Definitely a keeper.
5.0,"Delicious and perfect for a cold winter afternoon! I heeded the comments...used 2x more beef, half as much potatoes, and shredded cheddar instead of Velveeta. Hubby bragged at work and I shared the recipe. Definitely making again!"
5.0,Totally delicious!! This is our &#34;go to&#34; soup any time of year. I&#39;ve shared this recipe with many family members.  I do no change any of the ingredients. Obviously a family favorite!
5.0,"This soup should be called potato -cheeseburger soup because there are SO many potatoes. They are very good though. It&#39;s true that kids LOVE this soup. Mine did and asked for it all week. Fortunately, I made a double batch. I think the Velveeta made it kid friendly. This recipe is a keeper in our house."
5.0,Fantastic... and gets better each time you reheat it!
5.0,I will definitely make this soup again. Very tasty and filling. I used Mexican blend cheese instead of Velveeta. Made a big pot on a cold day and gave some to my neighbors. We all loved it. Definitely a keeper!

5.0,"Fantastic! I made the very same version of this soup, only without the sour cream before. I hadn&#39;t thought to add that in but it really made a wonderful difference in the taste! So glad i came across this recipe!"

5.0,My family begs me to make this....I double this recipe and serve with homemade bread...Love it!
5.0,"I have made this soup several times this winter. My family will empty the pot. It is so easy and simple to make. One thing that I did to save time was to use a 2 pound bag of hashbrowns instead of peeling and chopping the potatoes. I also cooked 6 or 8 strips of baccon, broke it apart and sprinkled the cooked bacon pieces as a garnish.  It was a hit!!"

5.0,"Finally a soup that my kids will not only eat, but love!  I made it for dinner tonight and before they were halfway through their bowlfuls they were begging me to pack some for their school lunches tomorrow.  The flavors are much more complex than I expected.  This recipe is a real winner that I will be making again and again."

5.0,This is my family&#39;s all time favorite soup recipe and they request it multiple times each winter.  I use leftover meatloaf to make it instead of ground beef.
5.0,OUTSTANDING SOUP.  REALLY GOOD!  Made 2/3/21 with following modifications:  Used combination of no sodium/low sodium chicken broth and 93% lean ground beef and extra sharp cheddar cheese.  Also sauteed diced potatoes in separate pan before adding to soup. The consistency of this soup is perfect:  somewhat thick and taste is superb.  If you haven&#39;t tried it I highly recommend.
5.0,"Very good! I&#39;d seen the recipe many times, but always thought it sounded gross, judging by the name.  After actually reading it I decided to give it a try. So glad I did.  I added 32oz of chicken broth, we like our soup more brothy. I used 1lb of Velveeta, about 2 cups grated. It was plenty of cheese. I think more would have been too much. I also threw in a couple diced jalepenos. I&#39;ll add a couple more next time.  My only complaint is the name of the recipe!"
5.0,"Delicious.  I added more beef, veggies and less potato.  Very good."
5.0,This is a delicious hearty soup.  I could hear my husband telling my granddaughter that it smelled so good as I was cooking it.  He was so primed to eat this.  When my son got home my husband asked him if he was hungry or starving.  One whiff of this soup and my son said &#34;Starving!&#34;  Out of this big pot of soup all that is left is barely enough for one serving tomorrow.  Highly recommend this!  TY Joanie Shawhan for sharing this.  TY TOH for posting this.  Once more TOH delivers!
5.0,"This was excellent! The only adjustments I made were to use cheddar instead of velveeta, and because my granddaughter just had braces put on, I blended it with an immersion blender before adding the milk and cheese. It isn&#39;t exactly PRETTY, but the flavor is phenomenal."
5.0,"This looks delicious.  If I want to make it in the slow cooker, are there anything different to do?  And also, how long would it take to cook in the slow cooker?"
5.0,delish!!!  will keep it for a regular soup
5.0,This was a very good soup. It was thick and cheesy with lots of veggies. Pretty much everything I could ask from a soup. I can see ways to adjust it for personal tastes with no problems. The only thing I didn&#39;t like was making the roux separately. But I will figure a way around that.
5.0,"This is one of my family’s favorite recipes. I’ve made it several times, as is with one added step. The addendum is I use an immersion blender to make the soup creamy.
My one complaint is the recipe reads makes 8 servings (2 quarts). This recipe fills my 6 quart Dutch oven! Plenty of leftovers."
5.0,"Yum! Added 1/2 tsp cayenne to spice it up, and smashed some of the potatoes with a potato masher to thicken."
5.0,"I liked this soup.  My kids don&#39;t like onions, so I used onion power and hashbrowns so save prep time."

5.0,My family loves this recipe!  The main changes I make is to add a little more hamburger and to use 2% Velveeta and cut the amount in half.  I add 1 c. of shredded cheddar in place of that.  Love it!

5.0,"I doubled the beef and thought it was much better.  Also you don&#39;t need to peel the potatoes, I&#39;ve made it both ways and you can&#39;t tell a difference. I only use three cups of potatoes and leave out the salt - the velveeta has MORE than enough salt already!"
5.0,Thought it was delicious.  Great with three cheese bread on a cold day!  I used 1 lb of beef and it was perfect!
5.0,"I always read the reviews to see if I feel I need to make changes. I did double the ground beef and used half canned milk and half 1% milk. Then doubled the recipe. Only problem I had was my husband complained that I gave too much away because it was so good. Quadrupled it for a light lunch at Christmas Eve for the whole family. Loved by all, even the pickiest eaters."

5.0,I love this easy potato soup. I used a 32 oz. bag of frozen hashbrown instead of cutting up all those potatos. Worked just great. My family loved it. My son wants a batch to carry back to college.

5.0,"This was so good!  One of my favorite soups I&#39;ve tried so far.  I usually don&#39;t care for recipes with velveeta, but it&#39;s perfect for this.  I used skim milk, 2% velveeta, and reduced fat sour cream (and lean ground beef), and it was still excellent! Tastes like at a restaurant, but with the reduced-fat ingredients, probably much healthier!"

I said &#34;I&#39;m going to put the rest in the freezer for another night&#34; and he said NO you&#39;re not, I am eating this tomorrow!&#34;.

I must give credit to &#34;Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives&#34; for that idea.  We will be having this again. "

I do add more veggies, and more milk or broth as needed to get the consistance we like, so I end up with close to a gallon of soup. I like to add chopped sweet potatoes, a bag if mixed veggies, or whatever veggies I have on hand. I love all the different colors. This soup is a wonderful base to add anything you like."

5.0,I am not a fan of cottage cheese at all outside of substituted for ricotta in lasagna. I made this exactly as written. It was so easy to put together and so good. It was even better reheated for leftovers. Thank you for this wonderful recipe. It could have many substitutions as in meat or cheese and perhaps veggies thrown in. I could not get over how flavor filled it was. Just a total joy to put in my mouth.
5.0,"Delicious!!  I use 1 lb. ground beef, and make it a day before I plan to serve it as we think it\&#39;s better the second day."
5.0,I love this recipe! it is great on a cold winter evening!

5.0,Excellent recipe!  My whole family loves it!
5.0,This is a great recipe!  Filling enough for a full supper with maybe some homemade bread on the side too.  You can use any leftover veggies you may want to add to this too!

5.0,A kid pleaser in my house.  This quickly became a family favorite.
5.0,We enjoy this recipe but felt the cheese content was too much so we use kraft cheese singles - about 10 slices and it still maintains the great flavor!
5.0,"Comfort food supreme!  No changes needed except salt and pepper preference!  Nice, creamy rich soup!"
5.0,I made this last night. And it was very good. Definitely making it again! I didn&#39;t use shredded Velveeta but had shredded cheddar cheese. Didn&#39;t whole milk but used 2%. And added a tsp or so of dill pickle relish to our servings and it made a huge difference in tasting more like a cheeseburger.
5.0,"I do a full lb of ground beef, but this is fantastic! Nice spin on potato soup with the change of the regular protein!"
5.0,"Made this for our Football Sunday in Snowy Upstate New York.   Doubled it as I have 4 grown men, with some Texas toast.  They all loved it,  Guaranteed it will be done by the time the day is over.  Thank you for a great recipe!!!"
5.0,"My two kids can be fairly picky eaters. They have recently decided they like cheeseburgers. I saw this soup recipe and thought &#34;Why not? Let&#39;s give this a try.&#34; Miracle of all miracles, they both liked the soup! Instead of garnishing with sour cream, we used a few spoonfuls of pickle relish because whenever my daughter orders a cheeseburger in a restaurant she orders it with &#34;pickles, extra pickles, and more extra pickles.&#34;"
5.0,"Very good! To save using an extra pan, I did not divide the butter; I melted all of the butter to cook the vegetables in, then stirred in the flour to cook it - I then proceeded with the recipe as written."
5.0,Loved this! I used mushroom broth and cheddar for my soup. Still turned out amazing and the hublet devoured it.
5.0,I have made this delicious soup several times! Always very tasty! My husband loves it and ànyone who tastes it wants recipe! I think next I make I will add bacon crumbled. I made exactly what the recipe called for but forgot to add the sour cream this time but still good!! Thank you very much for sharing recipe! 😊
5.0,My kids absolutely love this recipe!
5.0,"After seeing this recipe for years, I finally got around to making it yesterday, and I&#39;m sorry to say, I&#39;m kicking myself for not trying it much sooner!  I didn&#39;t have whole milk, so I used 1 can of evaporated milk, and it was awesome!  Best soup ever!"
5.0,The change I made was omitting celery and adding fresh red pepper in its place.  We loved this!
5.0,"So good!!  I saved myself a pan though in the directions - after I transferred the cooked ground beef (I used a full pound and it was perfect) to a plate, I melted all of the butter called for in the same pan, sauteed the onions, carrots and celery and then sprinkled the flour over top after the veggies had softened.  I mixed in the diced raw potatoes and the cooked ground beef and then poured in the chicken broth.  It smelled so good while it was cooking!!  Once the potatoes were cooked through, I added in the milk and I used shredded sharp cheddar instead of Velveeta, it is what I had on hand.  I also left out the basil and the sour cream and I am glad I did - my whole family loved this and I will definitely be making it again!  It came together so fast, a very hearty soup and so easy to make!  Even without my changes, this would&#39;ve been delicious, but I love how easy it is to alter it to your own tastes, you can&#39;t go wrong with this recipe."
5.0,"I love this recipe but won&#39;t try .  dont
 like the time it tales to cook. I;m disabled and limited to standing time."
5.0,"This soup was excellent! It was my first time making a homemade soup, and it made me a star with my husband and our son! They loved it, and so did I. Wonderful flavor."
5.0,"This is so easy to make.  I used bacon and it was delicious and easy.  We did this as breakfast for dinner, but I will use this for breakfast when I have company for the holidays."
5.0,Delicious as written and so easy to change up for personal preference. Even my cottage cheese haters loved it!  I run my cottage cheese through the food processor to give it the consistency of ricotta. Just takes a minute or two.  I use this hack for lasagne too.
5.0,"LOVED THIS..followed to the letter...well,  I did sprinkle extra cheese on top last few minutes...! Can never have too much cheese!
Have never eaten this sort of hot dish before and first time making it..( did do half recipe in 8x8 pan..and mixed up at night..kept in fridge..baked next day...GREAT RESULTS..THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE!"
5.0,I&#39;ve made this for several family gatherings and everyone raves about it and wants the recipe.  It is so cheesy and good.
5.0,This was an very tasty recipe! I used Jimmy Dean Turkey sausage links cut up instead of bacon. I also added a small amount of diced green pepper with the onion. I used Fat Free cheddar jack shredded cheese plus the Swiss cheese. I did 1/3 of the recipe and put it in muffin tin!!  It was amazing!!! Do try it!!
5.0,"Saved this to my home screen folder and will be making it this weekend for dinner. Thanks for sharing!

*EDIT 4/11/22*Made this tonight for dinner. We don&#39;t really care for Swiss cheese and we couldn&#39;t find Gruyere, so I subbed about 3/4 cup of Parmigiano-Reggiano and I used scallions instead of white, sweet onion because they give egg dishes a metal taste. Didn&#39;t need, but a half of a teaspoon of kosher salt and about a teaspoon of white pepper. I also added some diced green pepper and we both loved it. Next time I will grate some fresh garlic and sauté the vegetables separately from the bacon. Delicious! Definitely a keeper!"
5.0,This is my go to breakfast casserole. I like to add cooked asparagus and extra cheese. Definitely worth the calories. Easy to make the night before and bake in the morning.
5.0,"I really enjoyed this dish, and made it as written (cut in half ) and used &#34;Simply Potatoes&#34; for the hash brown component. It was an excellent breakfast twice! In the future I&#39;ll probably cut back on the bacon, or use leftover ham."
5.0,"Yummy! Yummy! Due to high fat and salt content, this is our ‘Once A Year’ treat. But, yummy."
5.0,I’ve made this many times and it’s wonderful. I’ve taken it to different potluck breakfasts and to the home bound and receive many compliments. You can easily change things to suit your taste and can change the cheeses but the Swiss really does make this stand out.
5.0,"I love this recipe. I’ve made it several time and always end up with a clean dish. I add extra bacon, natures seasoning, and use simply potatoes for convenience. I make it the night before and take it out the next morning and cook. It’s my go to casserole"
5.0,"All ages LOVED this recipe!!  I make lots of breakfast casserole&#39;s when we travel or when having company.  I have my 3 favorites that I have rotated for the last 20 plus years and occasionally try new ones.  Now I have 4 favorites because this one is a definite keeper! I did exactly as the recipe called for and it turned out perfect! The suggestion about green chili&#39;s sounds wonderful and I may try that next time, but honestly it doesn&#39;t need it for flavor, it seriously was perfect as is! Thank you for sharing!"
5.0,"This came out delicious.  And, I have to confess I modified it…okay…changed it due to what I had in the fridge.  I used 1lb of Italian sausage, Monterey jack cheese only, fresh spinach and baked frozen tater tots 10 minutes!  I didn&#39;t mix it altogether but built it like a quiche: Meat/onions/spinach mixture on the bottom, Monterey Jack cheese and then the egg, cheese and cottage cheese mixture. Topped it with more jack cheese. And, I baked it in my 9&#34; x 9&#34; ceramic dish and it was amazing. I was a little reluctant to serve it for breakfast as it might be a better lunch or dinner entree but hubby thought it was terrific. Next time I make it (and there WILL BE a next time), I&#39;m going to follow the recipe so I&#39;ll have a comparison. But I think whatever you do, this recipe will always taste amazing! Thanks for sharing!"
5.0,I make this every year for Christmas morning breakfast. It’s delicious!   I use 9 eggs per the recipe I have. Everything else is the same.
5.0,Family favorite. I add 10-12 eggs because it’s an ‘egg casserole’. I use spicy chicken sausage instead of bacon sometimes.
5.0,"Have been making this one for years.  I did alter for our taste.  I use 1/2 lb bacon and 1/2 lb ham.  I add jalapeños and use 10 eggs.  Please note, this requires a longer baking time.  I  plan for an hour and a half as I let it stand for 10 minutes before serving."
5.0,I made this on Christmas Eve to serve Christmas morning.  I am so glad I did!  It was easy and delicious—even reheated great with a splash of milk to loosen it up a few days later.  This is a keeper and great to use when you want to save yourself time on a holiday or when you have guests.
5.0,I have been making this casserole for Christmas morning ever since I saw it in Taste of Home years ago.  Everyone loves it!
5.0,Delicious! I used turkey bacon and added dried cilantro. Baked 40 minutes in my 2quart oval glass baker!
5.0,Wow! Delicious! I cooked it in the skillet I fried bacon and onions in and it turned out perfect. I usually don&#39;t like breakfast casseroles but; this one is amazing!
5.0,"This is an excellent recipe! Yes, it has less eggs than most breakfast casseroles, it is more of a hashbrown casserole than egg casserole and that&#39;s ok! I made this for my DIL&#39;s baby shower and got many compliments and requests for the recipe."
5.0,This is by far my favorite breakfast casserole. It is always a hit. I made it just like the recipe above the first time and it was good. Now I add 2 extra eggs for a total of 8. I also use Morton’s Nature Seasoning. I do bacon the majority of the time but have added sausage as well. I also use Simply Potatoes hash browns in place of frozen.
5.0,This was a very good breakfast casserole. I didn&#39;t have bacon on hand. I used sausage instead and the casserole tasted great. This is going in my recipe book.
5.0,"I love this casserole! It is easy to prepare, can be made the day before, and everyone enjoyed it.  I doubled the recipe for a houseful of July 4th weekend guests this year and it was the first thing to disappear off the buffet table! A definite keeper!"
5.0,Great breakfast for everyone!
5.0,My family absolutely loves this recipe!  We have it every Christmas morning.  It&#39;s so easy to make the night before and then I pop it in the oven in the morning before everyone wakes up.  I didn&#39;t think I would like it because of the cottage cheese but it&#39;s delicious.
5.0,Delicious. What is the best way to freeze and then thaw out?
5.0,I made this recipe as is but I did cut it in half and it was delicious.  Reading other comments I was surprised to read some of the negative comments.  This was excellent and I do not know why theirs did not taste great.  Oh well my opinion is this was so easy and I had all the ingredients so I did not have to go out of my house at this time.  Thanks for sharing it.
5.0,This is probably a good recipe but I think it would be much better if some milk was added to loosen it up.
5.0,"When me and my friends go to the shore, we always make this recipe because everyone loves it! We just add a little green pepper to it. Great to make for a group of people."
5.0,Super easy to make and absolutely delicious!!  My husband does not like anything with cottage cheese but he didn’t even know there was any in it and he had three servings!!  This will be my new go to.
5.0,"Was so happy with how this recipe turned out! I needed a breakfast casserole for a girls weekend getaway &amp; this recipe really came through! It sounded simple ( in ingredients &amp; instruction). Big plus...ingredients were readily on hand. The only changes I made was to substitute the Swiss cheese with Pepper Jack cheese, &amp; added a dash of  granulated garlic. Chopped green chilies sounded good as well, but I didn’t have any on hand...next time!  The casserole was so flavorful. Everyone enjoyed it. I will definitely be making this recipe again!"
5.0,"I made this exactly as the recipe is here, with ham, for us and for a neighbor.  AMAZING!!  I was tempted to add salt and pepper, but really didnt need to.  My husband is not a fan of casseroles, but loved this one.  It is quick, easy and absolutely delicious.  THANK YOU!"
5.0,Good recipe.  Even the old boy enjoyed it
5.0,"I&#39;ve make this soup countless of time. Food day at work this soup is always requested. I follow the recipe as written with the exception of adding what ever left over cheeses I have in the refrigerator along with the Velveeta.  I am making this soup this week, instead of buying the 5# of potatoes, I&#39;m going to try using the cubed hash brown potatoes from the freezer section at the grocery store."
5.0,"<p>This is the best soup recipe ever! Except, I double the hamburger. A friend, a vegetarian, leaves the hamburger out and she loves it that way.</p>"
5.0,"<p>I downloaded this recipe after recently receiving it in an email from Taste of Home.  I made it today and just love it.  My wife decided to add just a little yellow mustard to her bowl.  OMG! That&#39;s a much better Cheeseburger flavor.</p><p>GREAT RECIPE.</p><p>James, NM</p>"
5.0,"This recipe was highlighted in a recent Taste of Home email and I had to try it.  

It was excellent!  

The recipe was a bit high in sodium so I chose to use unsalted butter.  I added mushrooms (as my preferred cheeseburger is a mushroom cheeseburger) and a bit of red pepper flakes for a little kick.

A shoutout to the wife of James569 with the suggestion of a adding a bit of mustard to the bowl (just a skosh) and to cincibetty for suggesting doubling the hamburger.

This recipe is destined for my next potluck."
5.0,I love this soup and have made it multiple times already! And it’s so easy to make
5.0,I&#39;ve made this banana bread recipe so many times now that I have it memorized.  It lives up to its name and really is the best ever banana bread I have tasted.  All of my family agree.
5.0,"Best Ever Banana Bread is a favorite at our house.  I always double the recipe since it goes so fast.  I get 3 loaves from a double batch by baking them in 8 x 4 x 2.5 inch glass loaf pans.  Oven temperatures may vary, so check them after an hour; generally mine take 1-1/4 hours.It&#39;s hard to resist having a slice fresh from the oven.  Yum!!"
5.0,Made this for the first time and it is delicious. New banana bread recipe for me !!
5.0,Wonderful recipe! Best Banana Bread I&#39;ve ever had---even better than my Grandmother&#39;s! Easy to make as well! I definitely recommend this recipe! Pam
5.0,This is truly the best ever banana bread.  Very crunchy crust.Lori
5.0,I substitute butter for the oil.  This has been a favorite for many years.
5.0,"<p>I made this bread for Thanksgiving dinner everyone loved it.   The only left overs taken home by my guest was the bread.  1 review stated that the bread stuck so I placed wax paper into the bottom of the pan.  I did have 1 end that stuck but, I think this was my fault because, I left the nuts in half sizes which stuck to the side of the pan and pulled the bread apart when I tried to remove it.   I will be cooking several loafs at Christmas to give away and I will use wax paper for the bottom and sides.</p>"
5.0,"I have been making this Banana Bread since I first saw the recipe in 1992, and it is the Best Ever.Marilyn"
5.0,This is a delicious recipe.  I will definitely be making this again.  The only substitute I made was replacing the walnuts for pecans.  The result was successful and delicious.  Thank you for sharing.
5.0,Delicious! The only thing I changed was using pork sausage instead of bacon. Everyone had seconds.
5.0,"Found this under the title of &#34;Farmers&#39; Casserole&#34; and have been making it every two days for just over two weeks and have made some changes. Use a slightly larger casserole dish and do NOT use frozen anything. When the recipe states 3/4 cup - use 1 full cup and no need to let it sit overnight prior to placing in the oven. Also, the time it takes is tricky because it will depend on the ingredients used along with the size of the casserole dish. We will place (lightly) a sheet of aluminum foil over the top for the first 30 minutes so it won&#39;t crust over too badly. PLUS, the seasonings need to be adjusted according to your family&#39;s tastes.  BUEN PROVECHO"
5.0,"Before I retired I frequently add this casserole for a morning treat for my coworkers and occasionally sent it with my hubby to his job! Everyone loves it even folks who cringe when you mention cottage cheese! It really does just melt right in. I usually use build pork sausage like Jimmy Dean because you can get it together without the mess of cooking up bacon! And I increase the amounts of most everything when taking to a group...exact amounts have never seemed to be too important...the outcome is always great! Like some others commenting, I’ve frequently added diced sweet peppers.   I also make a smaller version in a skillet and bake that for just us at home! Try this one, I’m sure it will become one of your faves too!"

5.0,My family and friends love this recipe. It&#39;s easy to make and versatile. Sometimes I use ham or sausage instead or add veggies like peppers or change out the kinds of cheese. Just depends on what&#39;s in my refrigerator.  Its a go to favorite recipe to bring somewhere or eat at home.
5.0,This was great.  I did add salt and pepper and reserved some of the cheese for the top.
5.0,I&#39;ve made this same recipe but use a roll of sausage instead of bacon. And I use shredded mozzarella cheese instead of cottage cheese.
5.0,"I have made this several times. My family loves it. It also reheat and freezes well. I’ve made it with different kinds of meat and cheeses. Very easy to make. I’ve made it where I prepared it and baked it right away, and I’ve made it where I prepared it put in the refrigerator and baked it the next morning. Both ways are great."
5.0,This recipe has great reviews because it is a great recipe! So simple and easy yet so delicious! I just added a touch of salt and pepper. Perfect for brunch!

5.0,"This is a great recipe for the holiday&#39;s. I use bacon, Italian sausage"
5.0,"This was a delicious casserole! We liked it so well, we ate it for breakfast, then had leftovers for supper!  I subbed ham for the bacon and added some bell peppers. So good! Even the hubby was raving about it! Lol"
5.0,I have used this recipe for years!  I always mix it together on Christmas Eve and just pop it in the oven Christmas morning.  I love to add a small can or two of hatch chiles!  I mention it on my blog here: www.maternitydessert.com
5.0,"Not many recipes have 258 reviews! I made this for supper for my adult son and I the other night. I had read a lot of the reviews and also checked out other recipe sites online for the same recipe title. I used a dozen eggs and roughly chopped half a container of fresh, sliced mushrooms from Costco - which I fried with the onions - in the same pan as I had fried the bacon (I used low sodium), separately. I added a generous amount of freshly ground pepper (my son loves it) but didn&#39;t add salt as I felt the bacon and the cheese would provide enough. Seeing as I hadn&#39;t made this before I didn&#39;t make any other changes - unusual for me. It was a wholesome meal! I accompanied it with a dish of stewed, herb and spice whole tomatoes - but will use vine ripened local ones when they are available - I might even fry fresh tomato halves in the leftover bacon drippings. I will also serve it with a variety of relish and chutney recipes I make. Another reviewer&#39;s comment about using salsa is an option. Before warming the leftovers my son asked me to ramp up the flavour so I sprinkled some cayenne and garlic powder on the top and then added a layer of shredded cheddar cheese. I was pleased with the result (I don&#39;t like food as hot/spicy as my son), and my son thought it was an improvement. He wants me to make another one next week mixing the cayenne and garlic into the mixture before putting it in the casserole dish - adding a bit more of both than I&#39;d put on the one I reheated. Obviously a personal preference. He also wants me to substitute half the hash browns for thawed mixed veggies. I&#39;ll also add the whole 500g container of cottage cheese (that&#39;s 1/2 cup more than in this recipe), as we both love cheese.  Really pleased to find this recipe  - thanks Beth Notaro for sharing! It reminds me of an Old Order Mennonite friend I had who died too early a few years ago with cancer. I&#39;m sure that association added to my enjoyment of this casserole. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be making this countless times with numerous variations - as well as ones close to the original. I like the idea that it&#39;s bread and gluten free as I have friends who are conscious of needing to avoid gluten."
5.0,"very easy, quick and tasty.  I used sausage instead of bacon, a real family hit!!"
5.0,"I save bacon grease, so instead of using a pound of bacon, I saute the onions in approximately 3TBS of bacon grease and add a pack of the store bought diced ham. I follow the  rest of the directions. The ba on grease gives it a little bacon taste and the ham makes it seem meatier."
5.0,Easy to prepare and really enjoyed the taste and texture.  I added ham cubes and parsle instead of bacon. The hash brown weren&#39;t totally thawed so I needed to bake it an additional 10 minutes. Next time I want to add asparagus or spinach for added flavor and nutritional value.  Will be part of my &#34;Family&#34; recipe cookbook!
5.0,I make this for special holiday brunches. My family loves it!
5.0,One of my favorite go-to recipes.
5.0,"Huge hit with my family. Super easy to throw together. Have made many different variations with this recipe. Spicey sausage, monteray jack cheese instead of swiss cheese and added a small jar of salsa for a delicious mexican twist. Meat lovers style, with half of a pound of each, sausage, bacon and ham, and veggy with sauteed red and yellow peppers, spinach, onion and mushrooms with sliced tomatoes on top. All fantastic!"
5.0,"Ive made this numerous times with 4% cottage cheese and even 2% and it still tasted both great! My father in law and husband who are not fans of cottage cheese LOVED it and wouldn&#39;t have even known there was cottage cheese in there.  I have also used part skim cheese and it didn&#39;t make a significant difference just to make recipe lighter. I had a bag of potatoes to use up one time and chopped them into chunks and boiled them, drained, and used the recipe as is and they were delicious if you are looking to not use the frozen bag ones.Both ways are phenomenal but the skim substitutes makes per serving a bit lighter for those who are not looking for those who are watching their waist line =) excellent recipe and is a go to when I have a huge brunch and family visiting in town!"
5.0,Delicious! Next time I might try using sausage instead of bacon and adding green chilies... or maybe not as it was good just the way it was. Definitely a winner!
5.0,"Followed the recipe to a T and 8 people devoured this.  Very easy to put together, which I did the day before and baked in the morning.  Not great on the waste line, but a definite keeper!"
5.0,"This was awesome!  I&#39;ve been looking for a great breakfast casserole for years - and this is truly wonderful. I made it initially for a weekly teacher breakfast at my school.  I thought I had made too much - instead everyone gobbled it up and there was none left!  My only complaint is that I found it to be just a little bland.  (The recipe calls for no additional spices...which I thought was sort of odd.)  I browned the hash browns (which takes forever, good lord), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  (I made it the night before and then baked it in the morning before I left for work - this also turned out quite well!)  The second time I made it (tonight), I added a lot of salt and pepper to the eggs and the overall mixture.  I also added some truly excellent hot sauce my husband and I love to the eggs and into the whole mixture.  (Just a few dribbles.)  I basically added blindly.  It turned out SO WELL.  Just gave it enough heat to be interesting, but not overpowering.  My hot sauce is not for the faint of heart...so if you&#39;re using something less insane like Frank&#39;s or Sriracha, you made need more.  Additionally, my Swiss cheese bag was 1 1/2 cups...I figured extra cheese makes everyone happier, and I just added all of it. :D I think there&#39;s a lot of wiggle room to make it however it makes you happy.  But seriously: MAKE THIS.  IT&#39;S DA BOMB."
5.0,"Excellent breakfast casserole.   I added green pepper and a little garlic to it.   Also served it with salsa and sour cream.  This freezes well too.  I divided into two pans, baked one and froze the other."
5.0,"This is great,  I used ham (pre-cooked)"
5.0,"This is our all-time favorite breakfast casserole. I&#39;ve been making it for years. You can add any kinds of cheeses, any kind of meat or vegetables. We like using 3c potatoes instead of 4, and Gruyere instead of Swiss cheese. Thanks for sharing!"
5.0,"Prepared evening before then baked in morning.  Used sausage , onion and green pepper, instead of bacon, added tsp salt and pepper.  Turned out great."
5.0,I made this for Saturday dinner and my son and I like it.  I substituted sausage for bacon.  The next time I think I might add green pepper.  Definitely a keeper.
5.0,Served this for guests and everyone enjoyed it. I used hot turkey sausage instead of bacon and Monterey Jack cheese instead of Swiss. I seasoned the eggs and threw in some red bell pepper because I had it on hand. I made it the day before and did not thaw the hash browns per another reviewer&#39;s suggestion. Worked great. Next time I&#39;ll add some diced green chiles or hot peppers to spice it up a bit more.  Really good!
5.0,"Made this on a beach trip. Used potatoes o&#39;brien, and added mushrooms, used shredded bacon cheddar cheese and sharp cheddar. This was fantastic! So many different things you could add. Loved it!"
5.0,Family enjoyed it!
5.0,"Very good, will make again for sure."
5.0,"Used sausage instead of bacon, added 1/2 cup milk, 2 minced garlic cloves and 1/2 tsp black pepper. Very good."
5.0,"I make this several times a year, I bring it to staff breakfasts at my school as well. Always a hit."
5.0,Fantastic!  I use this for Holiday breakfast time when family comes over.  I make it up the night before and it&#39;s so easy for morning.  I add some additional ingredients like mushrooms and green peppers.  Everyone enjoys!
5.0,Made this for a church pot luck and brought home an empty dish.  I did use  hot sausage instead of bacon and liked the flavor it added.
5.0,"We made this for our guests on Christmas morning. A HUGE hit, even for the picky eaters! We also crave it for lunch and dinner now. :)"
5.0,I’ve made this several times and it’s always a hit.I use bulk sausage in place of the bacon. Just my preference.Definitely one of my favorite go to recipes for an easy and tasty breakfast or brunch dish.
5.0,"Mary, did you even make this?!  It sounds like you didn&#39;t based on your comment.  If that&#39;s the case, you have no right reviewing it.  This is a wonderful breakfast treat.  Please keep your negativity and baseless commentary to yourself."
5.0,"I have made this several times, and it is so good. I took it to an Easter brunch we had at church, and there wasn&#39;t even a crumb left! I got asked for the recipe a lot.I agree with andreasmom2u, Mary needs to make the recipe before commenting."
5.0,This sounds wonderful.  Does anyone know if it can be put together and then frozen for later use?
5.0,This breakfast casserole was delicious.  I cooked it in the cast iron skillet I cooked the bacon in.  Then served it with sliced avocado and tomatoes.
5.0,I thought the mixture looked dry for an egg casserole so I added 1/4 cup of milk.  DON&#39;T DO IT.  I had to bake it longer because of the extra moisture.   Follow the directions.  It tasted excellent!
5.0,"I have two breakfast casseroles that I traditionally make and this one is hands down the favorite.  Based on the good reviews, I used my Sunday School class as guinea pigs and made this recipe because it is enough to feed a group.  There was not one bite left and many request for the recipe.  I did put together the casserole the day before and took it out the next morning to bake.  I needed about 5 minutes more baking time (45 minutes total).  Also, based on some of the other reviewers suggestions I added a small can of diced green chiles which added perfect flavor.  Overall this dish is a winner."
5.0,A definite keeper!  I&#39;ve made this for gatherings of both family and friends. This recipe is  HIT and I make it just as the recipe identifies.  Guests always  ask for the recipe.
5.0,I used to make this several years ago. We really enjoyed it.
5.0,My mom has made this for years and is the &#34;go to&#34; recipe when all of the family is over for breakfast!  EXCELLENT!!
5.0,Very delicious. I cut the recipie  in half and used an 8X8 baking dish. I assembled it the night before and popped it in the oven this morning.
5.0,"This is one of our favorite recipes.  We like it with ham...good way to use leftovers.  I&#39;m going to do what one other reviewer did, and try ricotta cheese this time, since I have some I need to use.  Thanks for recipe."
5.0,"The whole family loves this!  When I&#39;ve brought this dish for potluck gatherings, literally EVERYONE asks for the recipe."
5.0,Recently made this one; it was very good. Will definitely make again.
5.0,I like recipes where I have all the ingredients so tasty and easy to fix  .and a family that finds eggs a problem enjoyed every bite of this  and when we&#39;re having this again!  Next Saturday when we will have guest. Thanks for this breakfast recipe~~Rosemary
5.0,I made this and it was a huge hit. Substituted sausage for bacon since I didn&#39;t have bacon. Added chopped up red pepper instead of onions as well. Served with homemade biscuits and fruit. Will make again.
5.0,"I&#39;ve discovered making one loaf of this wonderful bread is never enough.  Soooo, I double recipe which yields three 8x4x2 inch loaves."

5.0,I have tried many and this is my favourite by far!  It did take about 20 min longer in the oven and I used pecans
5.0,"Shared this recipe with my mom--she agrees that it beat grandma&#39;s &amp; is our new &#34;family&#34; recipe. If grandma were around, she wouldn&#39;t mind since we discovered most of her &#34;secret recipes&#34; came from Taste of Home :)"
5.0,"I baked this bread for a friend and she absolutely loved it!  I have not had the opportunity to bake me a loaf but, I will be sure to do so after the reviews it received from her!  Smelled like an amazing bread!"
5.0,"I made this recipe  on Sunday and it was great. My husband &amp; I really enjoyed it, that I took made a double batch and gave some to my neighbor.  It truly is the best.  Yes I will be making this alot.  I also ran out of the loaf pans so I made 12 muffins also.  My husband really enjoyed taking them to work for his breakfast.  The best and thank you for sharing the recepe."
5.0,This is  my go to recipe for banana bread-turns out great every time!
5.0,"Excellent!  I doubled the recipe and made two loaves, so I could give away one. The name of the recipe is true. Very moist, very good."
5.0,I think this is the exact recipe I have made for 15 years. I did change it though. I use 4 overripe bananas and no buttermilk and add a bag of chocolate chips.
5.0,Just finished baking this for the very first time. I was so intrigued to bake it since it has so many great reviews. It came out great! Much better than other banana bread recipes I have tried. My picky 3-year-old daughter even loved it. It&#39;s definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.
5.0,"I had my reservations, since once burned with a recipe stated as being &#34;the BEST&#34; and was not, but I tried it anyways and I&#39;m so GLAD I did.  I&#39;m not a fantastic lover of banana bread but this one proved to be the exception.  It truly is the best one that I&#39;ve ever tasted and &#34;hubby&#34; said the same, with rating it to be a &#34;10&#34; in goodness.  I exchanged white sugar for raw, organic cane sugar and used 1/4 cup less sugar.  I also used organic bananas that were very ripe and organic eggs. This one definately go in my BEST foot recipe category.  Yum...!"
5.0,"OMG! Yes  this recipe is delicious, u can tell, look at the reviews.  I made it and the whole pan was gone the same day, between my husband and 14yr old son.  I&#39;m baking another as we speak.  I used 3 VERY RIPE bananas, it is DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!"
5.0,"this absolutely a keeper,  I have made this several times"
5.0,This was a great recipe! It was moist and very good. Since we didn&#39;t have buttermilk we just made buttermilk by putting a teaspoon if vinegar every cup of milk. Turned out great!
5.0,I made three loaves at one time and in two days they were all gone!!!  My family loves it and a neighbor asked for the recipe.  I am waiting and watching for bananas to over ripen!
5.0,The best ever! I add bacon and sausage this morning with onion and peppers. I used Jalepeno cheese and cheddar! Very moist too. A must try if you haven&#39;t!
5.0,Really great breakfast dish!  I like to add green chilies along with some salt and pepper.
5.0,So simple and tasty!
5.0,Everybody loves this recipe!  I don&#39;t thaw the hash browns if making the night before.  I just mix as instructed and put in the refrigerator. Since everything is cold I add 10 more minutes to baking time.
5.0,Made with sausage instead of bacon. Did not thaw hash browns and made the night before. Refrigerated overnight. Very good!
5.0,"This was great!  I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  Yummy, everyone except my daughter enjoyed it, but she hates almost everything."
5.0,"With this many positive reviews (and yayyy, I&#39;m 200!), I felt like this was a no-brainer to try. It was delicious....easy to throw together, hearty and simple to tweak. I am having a bunch of summer guests staying with us, and I plan to make this a staple breakfast dish. THANK YOU for sharing!"
5.0,"Used bacon, ham, and SW hash browns. Fabulous."
5.0,"Have made this numerous times in my home and everyone loves it.  I fry up country sausage and onion, make the bacon in the microwave so it&#39;s not so greasy, and I place the sausage and onion mixture at the bottom of the pan and add the rest on top.  To die for!"
5.0,I used a four cheese Mexican blend and cubed turkey ham instead and it went over big time. It is good.
5.0,I have been making this recipe for years.  Everybody loves it.  I always make it without the meat for those darn vegetarians in our lives!  Meat on the side for the rest of us.  Always a hit!
5.0,I loved this recipe.  I substitued sage sausage for the bacon and it was a big hit.  I think it could pass as a side dish for any meal.
5.0,"I made this recipe for a church event and it was gone in minutes.  There was another breakfast casserole dish next to it and mine was gone way before the other!  I used browned breakfast sausage and 12 eggs.  I didn&#39;t have Swiss cheese so I didn&#39;t use it and truth be told, we didn&#39;t miss it.  I think the extra cheese would have made it too rich and greasy.  I baked for 1 hour 15 minutes in my oven (likely due to the extra eggs).  The addition of cottage cheese was an unexpected surprise, but I didn&#39;t even notice it was there.  If anything, it added moisture to the dish so that it would not be too dry.  This is a great gluten-free recipe to breakfast casseroles that use bread.  I also prepped this dish in a pan and let it sit overnight before baking in the morning.  Next time, I might add a small can of green chiles to the mix.  This will be my go-to recipe for breakfast casserole!"
5.0,"I just have a question about this recipe. It looks really yummy. Has anyone made this exactly how the recipe say&#39;s the night before baking? And if so, did it turn out good?"
5.0,"This is the best breakfast casserole I have ever made.  I cut into 15 pieces and freeze.  Thaw in refrigerator the number of squares you want overnight, heat in microwave and you have a quick week day breakfast. Great served with grits and toast."
5.0,"I prepare breakfast for 12-16 Methodist fellows once a month, and this particular recipe is their favorite.  It contains all the ingredients in one place!!"
5.0,Delicious!! I added a handful of diced ham along with the bacon- just because.  Really liked the hash brown base. Quick and easy to prepare. The family loved it- multiple requests to for the recipe. Will definitely make this again!!
5.0,"Delicious! I made 2 dishes of this, one with ham and one with sausage. Added a couple extra eggs to one dish. Next time I make this I will also add a couple extra egg giving the dish a little more fluff."
5.0,"Changed this up just a tiny bit. Used 8 eggs, 6 cups hash browns and diced ham instead of the bacon. It was a huge hit for the guys at the cabin - nice hearty breakfast before a day of snowmobiling in Wisconsin&#39;s north woods! And the leftovers were terrific the next morning."
5.0,Easy casserole to make and excellent flavor.
5.0,"This is so tasty.  The last time I made this, I used breakfast sausage, and I really prefer it with bacon.  I like the fact that it doesn&#39;t have to sit overnight in the fridge.  When I have a crowd for breakfast , this is the casserole that I make. The whole family loves it. I prefer this to the one that doesn&#39;t include the cottage cheese. One piece makes you want more. Addicting!"
5.0,This is a Christmas brunch dish which is always on my menu...delicious! It is super simple to assemble the night before and just pop in the oven to bake on Christmas morning. My six sons and their Dad all love it!
5.0,"I made this this morning but halved the recipe since I didn&#39;t have the exact ingredients. I browned the onions,bacon, and added red and green peppers. I used 6oz of leftover Sour Cream and Onion Dip (the one in the container. I didn&#39;t have cottage cheese) and added a little extra cheddar cheese to sub for not having the Swiss. It came out excellent!! Very flavorful using the dip mix. It was even better baking it in my cast iron pan- nicely browned on the bottom. This will be in our breakfast rotation!"
5.0,Really good! Didnt add cottage cheese for personal preferences and turn out amazing. made for 7 and had no leftovers!
5.0,Made exactly as written. This was amazing!
5.0,This is a great recipe. I added diced green chili&#39;s. But don&#39;t think it originated with the Amish as they don&#39;t have electricity to keep frozen hash browns. They live very frugally without electricity.
5.0,"Great recipe! I added chopped up broccoli , sausage and pepperoni slices. Great flavor!I have made this twice and my husband loved it. Makes for great leftovers too!"
5.0,This is a good dish for breakfast or brunch. I used potatoes that I shredded myself and left out the Swiss cheese. It turned out delicious.
5.0,Good stuff for breakfast
5.0,"I only used half the onion and added other veggies - mushrooms, tomato, green pepper, etc. (drain excess water after cooking). I also sprinkled with pepper as well. Everyone loved it!"
5.0,I made this casserole for supper per the recipe &amp; it was wonderful. If you love bacon and hash browns this is the meal. I did end up baking it for about 55 minutes since I felt like it might not be done in the middle (knife wasn&#39;t coming out clean).  Served with mixed fruit and bagels.  Will definitely be making again.
5.0,Used both sausage and bacon.  Delicious.
5.0,This recipe is a keeper the newest addition to my recipe file.  Today is the first time I had tried this casserole; our cousin was dropping off some papers when she got to the door &amp; she wanted to know what smelled so good.  I invited her to come on in &amp; eat; she said my husband &amp; brother are with me; I said there is plenty tell them to come in too...Makes alot!!!  Recipe is not dry; moist &amp; is the perfect breakfast or lunch!!!
5.0,I made this for a family brunch and everyone loved it!
5.0,"this was the best b&#39;fast casserole we have had, very good!  I added pepper and also some hot sauce to it, awesome! :D"
5.0,This is the best breakfast casserole I&#39;ve ever made or eaten.  I take it to our monthly birthday parties at work and get lots of raves and asking for the recipe.  I use sausage and add more eggs than what it calls for.
5.0,"This is a wonderful breakfast casserole.  I make this up in several small pans and then send one to our daughter in college.  She loves it, even rewarmed."
5.0,Yummy and easy. It was the perfect size to feed a large group. This will be served at our home!!
5.0,"Really yummy, especially with breakfast sausage.  I was worried there wouldn&#39;t be enough flavor but there totally was!  I sprinkled pepper in it and used mozzarella instead of Swiss cheese just because I&#39;m not the biggest fan of Swiss cheese.  This would also be a really easy recipe to halve!"
5.0,"I make this every Easter and every bit of it goes.  So good!  I prep it the night before and toss it in a pan on Easter morning, couldn&#39;t be easier.  I use sausage sometimes to switch it up."
5.0,"Easy and delicious... great if you&#39;re feeding many! For two, we had leftovers for a few days (and didn&#39;t get sick of it!)"
5.0,I always make this recipe for Easter Sunday breakfast!  I love it!
5.0,Didn&#39;t have bacon on hand so I made the recipe with 1 tube of Jimmy Dean sausage but followed the rest of the recipe exactly... The ladies at church now know exactly what they will assign me to bring to brunch from now on!!
5.0,I made this for Easter Brunch. It definitely deserves 5 stars!! It fed a crowd. Adults and children ate it all.  I did not have cottage cheese on hand but used Ricotta cheese which I did have on hand. It would have been a little more moist if I had used cottage cheese which I will do next time. I put it together the day before and refrigerated it overnight. Perfect. Great Recipe!! Delicious. This will be my go to breakfast casserole (to serve alongside Pillsbury&#39;s French Toast Bake Casserole and a Virginia baked ham).
5.0,I made this breakfast casserole for a staff breakfast at work. It was super easy to make. I prepped the bacon and onions the night before and then threw the rest together and baked it in the morning before work. Everybody loved it and a few people asked for the recipe. It literally disappeared within a few minutes. No leftovers!
5.0,"The whole family loves this casserole.  Nice for when you have a houseful for breakfast.  Very easy to make and I like the fact you don&#39;t have to let it sit overnight.  I&#39;ve made it with bacon several times now.  Next time, may try with sausage."
5.0,"Great casserole &amp; loved every bit of it.  For the one/s who said this was tasteless, maybe you don&#39;t know how to cook, so you should start taking cooking class 101!!!"
5.0,"Really great! Made a few substitutions due to what I had on hand. Used both bacon and crumbled sausage, frozen diced onion and peppers, and Monterey Jack for the swiss cheese. Omitted the cottage cheese, not my favorite and a few dashes of hot sauce. Will be my go to casserole for any meal or that special breakfast/brunch. Thank you!"
5.0,Awesome!!!
5.0,This recipe is so easy &amp; delicious and the left overs were just as tasty reheated. This recipe is awesome as is but next time I make this I want to try fresh mushrooms &amp; maybe some green pepper.
5.0,"Although this is a great recipe on it&#39;s own, I&#39;ve sauteed bell peppers w/the onions and added green chilis. Just gives it a little extra kick. I rate the original recipe very highly. Everyone loves it!"
5.0,My family loves this!!! We&#39;ve even had it for dinner!!!
5.0,I made this recipe for a brunch held after my 40th high school reunion for our committee. I made 2 and their was not a crumb left plus several classmates requested the recipe!
5.0,"This was awesome!  We don&#39;t really like Swiss cheese, so I substituted mozzarella though. :)"
5.0,This was awesome.  Only substituted mozzarella for the Swiss because we don&#39;t really like Swiss.
5.0,Had a small group and halved the recipe and it was still so yummy! I used cubed hashbrowns because that&#39;s what I had on hand. Had to cook it @ 375 for the last 10mins to get it to finish. Great dish for groups big and small!
5.0,Excellent!
5.0,Excellent!  The entire family loved it!
5.0,This is an amazing &amp; easy-to-make casserole...I always prepare it on Christmas Eve and throw it in the oven Christmas morning!
5.0,I first made this for guests.   They loved it and wanted the recipe.  We like it as well and have made it again.  It&#39;s a great company breakfast casserole.
5.0,I made this over the holiday and guests really liked it.  I thought it was too rich with all the bacon and cheese.  Next time I&#39;d probably half the bacon and increase the amount of hash browns in the recipe.  I also used 2% cottage cheese.
5.0,Our family really enjoys this breakfast dish.  It is so much better than those that are based on bread and you don&#39;t have to wait with it in the fridge overnight.  I used pork sausage instead of bacon.  But like both.
5.0,Excellent.  Always goes fast.
5.0,Easy and delicious!
5.0,My family loved it.
5.0,This is my go to recipe when I am having overnight guests!  Love it! 
5.0,Made recipe as is but used more eggs for pot luck.  Made it healthier for myself using shreddred summer squash in place of potatoes and was excellent &amp; none knew the difference.
5.0,"Everybody loved it on a RV trip.  So much, that I wouldn&#39;t count on serving 12, more like 6."
5.0,My favorite breakfast casserole by far.  I usually make it with 1lb of Bob Evans sausage instead of the bacon because I keep it frozen.  One of our favorites.
5.0,"Quick, yummy, and my kids even ate it!"
5.0,"I made this for Easter. Assembled everything Saturday night and left it in the fridge, and threw it in the oven for 45 mins on Sunday morning. So good! I used a pound of lunch meat ham instead of bacon, and added chopped mushrooms as well. Very good!"
5.0,Very tasty! Would definitely make again and again and again.
5.0,Very yummy and easy to make.  Will definitely make again.
5.0,"I made this for a Mother&#39;s Day breakfast for my family.  Instead of bacon, I used a hamsteak.  It was very good."
5.0,This was very good! I will definitely be making it again :)
5.0,I thought I had the best banana bread recipe until I made this one!  It&#39;s great but I will use a little less sugar next time.  Too sweet for my taste!
5.0,"AMAZING!!! I made one loaf for my dad and then the rest of the family wanted more, so I ended up making 5 all together! These are incredible!!! :)"
5.0,"WONDERFUL!!! I have several banana bread receipe&#39;s but this one is the best and I will throw the other ones away. The first one I made was sooo good that I made it again the next day, as it was all gone in a minute. It is soooo moist and tastey, and everyone raved about it. I will tell everyone about it and share my receipe with them. I can give it a 10 star. Thanks for sharing it with us."
5.0,We really like this bread. I didn&#39;t have walnuts the last time so I used pecans instead. Yum.
5.0,Made a lot of banana bread in my time and this is definitely my favorite and my family&#39;s favorite recipe!  My family could not get enough of it so I will be making more again today!
5.0,This was really yummy!  I didn&#39;t have walnuts so instead I chopped up some almonds that I had on hand.  My husband loved it!
5.0,I have baked this bread many times over and got rave reviews from all who tried it! We always toast it in a toaster oven and then spread real butter over it! Wow..........the best!
5.0,So good!  The best banana bread ever and good with or without nuts!  Almost like banana cake without frosting.
5.0,"This was the hands down best banana bread I have ever made.  It was easy, and my family ate it all in one day and begged for more!"
5.0,"I usually make this into muffins and add about 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips. I use 1 cup sugar, and substitute almost all the oil with unsweetened apple sauce. This recipe is very good."
5.0,"Wonderful taste, very easy recipe. Did not change the recipe at all. This is my new favorite banana bread recipe. Thanks."
5.0,"made it in my 4 mini loafs pan, baked for an hour.   YUMMY!  yesterdays batch is gone, making a double today!"
5.0,It was so yummy and easy to make.  I added a few tablespoons of sour cream to the wet mixture to make it extra moist!
5.0,I really is the best banana bread. I have made it over and over again. You can play around with it too an add to it.
5.0,I put my own spin on this recipe. I didn&#39;t use the bacon but instead use ham and added mushrooms and used cheddar cheese.  I made it for company and everyone enjoyed.
5.0,"I made this for breakfast for the 4th of July, and it was fantastic. It was super easy and really enjoyable. I did make one substitution. I don&#39;t like cottage cheese, I don&#39;t even like the idea of cottage cheese, so I used ricotta cheese instead and it was perfect. This is a recipe to keep!!"
5.0,"Made this for a family brunch and divided into 2 pans (1 w/bacon and 1 without for a vegetarian) and both were a big hit.  I followed various people&#39;s suggestions, substituted cottage cheese with ricotta and used half mexican cheese and half mexican cheese with taco seasoning for a little kick.  Very easy to make and yummy!"
5.0,Simply delicious!!! Have made this several times and it&#39;s always a huge hit!  I always add extra meat - sausage and canadian bacon.  I NEVER have leftovers!
5.0,"I made it first time the way the recipe suggests for a breakfast with my son and grandchildren. It was well received. The basic rescipe lends itself to variations of your choice so I&#39;ve used smoke cured Ham, bulk breakfast sausage, smoked sausages, and even crabmeat and shrimp. I added fresh sliced mushrooms, red bellpeppers, and even the long green chile peppers seeded and diced small. I made fresh salsa with Cilantro and served it on the side. Ialso made fresh biscuits with butter and honey and a fresh fruit or melon. Great breakfast."
5.0,easy and great tasting and the kids all like it!
5.0,"This is the recipe that I use to feed a hungry crowd.When I made it the first time, I followed the recipe to the letter.  It was wonderful.Over time the only changes that I make is that I use 9 eggs instead of just 6.  I have also made it using breakfast sausage in place of the bacon.  I imagine it would be good with ham too.  YUM!"
5.0,"Didn&#39;t have Swiss, so just used cheddar and added green peppers.  Very tasty.  All the kids and hubby liked it.  We made it for supper with a little left over.  The kids want the left overs for breakfast."
5.0,"Although this recipe was great as is, I added 2 more eggs and substituted smoked gouda cheese for the Swiss and that really put it over the top!"
5.0,"I have been using this recipe from TOH for years and we still love it. I do change it up sometimes...sausage instead of bacon, add green chilies, different cheese...it&#39;s always great. I do always have to bake it a little longer than called for, and I let it stand a little longer than called for also...if we can wait that long to dig in it!"
5.0,this was great! I would add a couple more eggs but even without doing that this was great as in!! It was all gone with no leftovers!
5.0,This was so easy to make and everyone in my family loved it!!  This casserold will be a mainstay in my family for many years.
5.0,Made this for company breakfast and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. Making it today again...  So easy and I think I cut back slightly on fat and it was still good... A definite keeper!
5.0,I made it without the bacon (I didn&#39;t have any) and it was still fabulous!  Great recipe - thanks!
5.0,i made breakfast for dinner and the entire casserole was eaten! everyone had seconds.
5.0,Absolutely delicious! A family favourite.
5.0,"My family LOVES this casserole!  I had to alter it a bit for my large family.  I use 8-12 eggs, use pepper jack cheese instead of swiss and add a couple spoonfuls of sour cream.  I also substitute sausage when i didn&#39;t have bacon, and it was just as delicious.  This adds to my cooking time, approximately 50-60 minutes total but it is worth the wait."
5.0,"My son-in-law says he hates cottage cheese, but he declared this recipe &#34;A keeper&#34;.  Because I was feeding a crowd, I added a few more eggs, a pound of Lil Smokie links sliced (yes, I also added the bacon as directed) and switched the cheddar and swiss for a combo of cheeses we had on hand.  I liked the kick the pepper jack cheese gave it.  Hearty and delish!"
5.0,I followed the recipe exactly as stated.  It baked to a lovely golden brown. I served today to teachers at a Staff Appreciation Brunch.  They loved it and I brought home an empty container less than an hour later.  I&#39;ve added this to my &#34;go to&#34; list of recipes.
5.0,My husband liked the recipe. I used ham slices that I had. It was good.
5.0,This is soooooooooooo good
5.0,"Wow!  This is an awesome recipe!I cut it in half, substituted feta for the cheddar and hot pork sausage for the bacon.  Since there are only 3 in my family, that gave me a meal for one breakfast and I froze the other half for another morning.  This is SO easy and my hubby who doesn&#39;t really care for casseroles for breakfast said it was a &#34;keeper&#34;."
5.0,I made this for our LWML breakfast meeting and it was a great hit - any leftovers freeze well....
5.0,I&#39;ve made this recipe several times.  Each time I have omitted the onion and replaced the bacon with sausage.  It&#39;s always a hit.
5.0,"Made this for some company and it was a big hit. Even though I cooked it for the full time and let it stand before serving, the very center had not set up fully. But that won&#39;t stop me from serving this dish regularly."
5.0,I made this for an employee breakfast at work today and it was HIT!!
5.0,Excellent!  Everybody wanted more!
5.0,I made this last year for Christmas Breakfast and all my family loved it!  I cooked the bacon and onion mix the night before and put it in a sealed bowl till the morning and was perfect to mix the last bit and pop in the oven while presents were being opened!  It has been requested for a repeat Christmas Breakfast again this year!
5.0,Delicious! Kids and adults alike loved it!
5.0,This was soooo good and easy.  I took it to work and everyone loved it!  I followed the recipe except I did put 10 eggs.  Next time I think I will add green pepper and mushrooms.  You can&#39;t taste the cottage cheese but don&#39;t leave it out...I think it inhances the taste of the other cheeses.
5.0,"Made this again this morning!  Absolutely LOVE it!  I double the eggs, 12 total and sauté red and green pepper to throw in it!  Delicious!!!!  We even eat it for dinner too!"
5.0,We have tried this with bacon and sausage and enjoyed both.
5.0,Delicious!  I have never made a breakfast casserole before because none of the other recipes appealed to me. This one was a big hit for a holiday breakfast.
5.0,"I am eating this as I speak. It is really good, flavorful. I added chopped ham instead of bacon and I had a block of Irish Cheddar so I used that instead of the standard orange. Other than that, the recipe is the same. Oh, and I added a little bit of green onions along with the sweet. The cottage cheese makes it creamy and delicious. Excellent brunch dish"
5.0,"made this for Christmas Eve brunch 2011 everyone said it was delicious..next year I will make (2) 9x13&#39;s because it was gone so fast after people took seconds and thirds!!!  I didn&#39;t change anything in the recipe, however, I did make it the day before, covered it and put it in the refrigerator. I took it out 30 minutes before I baked it. It is a keeper and the only breakfast Casserole I will make from now on."
5.0,"Trust me, you don&#39;t taste the cottage cheese.  My son and husband can&#39;t stand cottage cheese, but they don&#39;t even know it&#39;s in the recipe.  I am so craving this recipe now too."
5.0,"I blended the cottage cheese and eggs (8 eggs) in a blender and added 1/4th cup of milk.  I also substituted cubed ham for the  bacon.  I sauteed up a yellow onion and mushrooms to add.  I omitted the swiss cheese.  I also added salt, pepper, ground mustard, and garlic powder.  This was supper yummy.  My husband likes to eat this with salsa.  Would be okay with ketchup for kids."
5.0,I made this recipe for family visiting from out of town and it was a hit. They took the recipe home and used it for a family gathering over Christmas...everyone wanted the recipe! Easy recipe and excellent tasting.
5.0,"I made this as a test to see if it&#39;s what I wanted to take to a bridal shower.  It was great!  I did follow the advice of one lady and made it with 12 eggs and 30 oz hash browns so it would be a little bigger. Being from the Southwest, you can&#39;t make an egg dish without throwing in green chili.  I bought the frozen kind and drained it before adding. Since it was bigger I baked it an hour."
5.0,There are never any leftovers when I make this.  It is hearty and delicious.
5.0,"<p>I always use 12 eggs but otherwise follow this to a T, and love it!  Have tried with both bacon and turkey sausage and it&#39;s great both ways!</p>"
5.0,Am so glad that you posted this as this is more than just a 5 star..everyone loves this thank you for this wonderful recipe.
5.0,I will make this again and again. My family and co-workers love this. A tip to make it even quicker is that I used a package of the Oscar Meyer real bacon bits you find on the Salad Dressing aisle and it was fantastic!! This is a recipe I will keep forever and so quick and easy to make!
5.0,"This is my first time writing a review for a recipe, but this one deserved a review, it was that good.  This was so tasty; I made it just as directed, except I used a pound of sausage (Bob Evans breakfast sausage).  Be sure to let stand for 10 minutes, in fact, I think 15 minutes is better.  I made it quicker by frying the sausage a day ahead."
5.0,"I made the Amish Breakfast Casserole this week for friends. Everyone gave it 10/10. However cholesterol wise, it&#39;s quite a bit when you consider all the cheese. It&#39;s a great recipe for a one dish breakfast. Will do a repeat again when we have guests for breakfast of for a brunch.Ottawa, Ontario, Canada"
5.0,"Simply Amazing! My wife and I tried this one out a few months ago, and it IMMEADIATELY became a weekly dish. a Must Try!"
5.0,"Yummy! And for &#34;Grampa,&#34; who doesn&#39;t like cottage cheese, you won&#39;t notice it if you put it in a blender with the eggs.I&#39;ve changed the recipe by using less potatoes (hubby can&#39;t eat a lot of carbs!) and adding fresh spinach, mushrooms &amp; bell peppers. It also can be spiced up lots more if that&#39;s your taste. Very adaptable recipe!"
5.0,Made this when I had family in from out of town and every on loved it.  So much they asked for a copy of the recipe.
5.0,After I made this recipe I have&#39;nt even triedanother one. This is a keeper!
5.0,"Delicious!!! Made with 12 eggs and turkey sausage. A very easy and cheap meal that the entire family will enjoy! Also, for those who don&#39;t like cottage cheese, you can&#39;t taste it in this dish a bit!"
5.0,I made this for my daughter&#39;s school&#39;s bake sale and it sold out fast.
5.0,Love it! This is my new Banana Bread recipe that I will be using!!  I used Half &amp; Half instead of the Buttermilk it called for and it turned out GREAT.
5.0,Delish!60 minutes for a dark pan.  The kids added chocolate chips!
5.0,This is the best banana bread recipe ever!  Very moist and great banana flavor.
5.0,"I&#39;ve been baking this banana bread (or as muffins) since it appeared in Country, October 1991. It is very moist and always delicious. Changes I&#39;ve made over the years: use 1 c. white flour with 3/4 c. whole wheat flour; use buttermilk powder with water; use 3/4 c. grapenuts cereal instead of walnuts (gives it a bit of a crunch and some texture while being nut allergy-free."
5.0,Amazing with chocolate chips!!!
5.0,Wonderful bread!!!!!  I added an extra half cup or so of banana because I used three very ripe bananas.  It was exceptionally moist.
5.0,i love this bread and so dose everyone i make it for the only thing i never have butter milk so i do the lemon juice trick or use sourcream butit is wounderful
5.0,"AMAZING! I want to try it with applesauce instead of oil next time. Very good, so glad I found this"
5.0,Sweet &amp; moist
5.0,I tried this recipe over the Christmas holiday as a brunch item for my guests.  The bread disappeared quickly.  They requested it as a must have for next year!
5.0,"Really, truly delicious!I wanted to make banana bread for my house full of people at Christmas time, but I had misplaced my grandmother&#39;s tried and true recipe when we moved last summer.  So I came to tasteofhome.com for a banana bread recipe to follow in a pinch.  It was a hit!I especially love the fact that this recipe is made with vegetable oil rather than shortening (like grandma&#39;s recipe was), so I was able to avoid using the hydrogenated oils found in shortening.  And I didn&#39;t have buttermilk on hand, so I substituted an equal amount of milk with 1 T. white vinegar added, and it still came out perfect.Best banana bread I&#39;ve ever made. :)"
5.0,I make this without buttermilk. I add 4 bananas instead of three. 
5.0,Baking my 4th loaf of the weekend right now! My kids say this is THE BEST banana bread I&#39;ve ever made!
5.0,"Being I&#39;m watching the fat intake, I found this recipe easy to defat with turkey bacon and lowfat or no fat cheeses. If you don&#39;t have frozen hash browns, shred or dice the   potatoes."
5.0,Made this for a Bible Study Brunch and was a huge success.  The potatoes are a welcomed change from bread and the cottage cheese makes it oh so creamy.  Wouldn&#39;t change a thing and will definately make again.
5.0,very good made for faimly
5.0,I have made this for Christmas morning the last two years.  It is a hit.  I substitue Monterey Jack for the Swiss.  And I cook the bacon and onion up the night before and measure out the other ingredients in a large bowl.  Basically do everything except add the eggs.  I do that in the morning.  I get it out a few minutes earlier and bake it a little longer.  Works really well.
5.0,"We were snowed in and I made this, and it is fantastic . . . cannot wait to make it again.  I used Bob Evans sausage since I had it on hand and probably used close to 5 cups of shredded hashbrowns to make it firmer.  My husband and I love it, and this is our new favorite breakfast casserole now.  The next time I will use bacon instead to see if it is as good."
5.0,Wow!  This was great!  I used extra-sharp cheddar cheese.  My husband and kids loved it.  Thank you for a great recipe I will use a lot.  :)
5.0,My daughter is going back to college this morning and I wanted to make something she would enjoy &amp; get her back on the road to finish up her last year of college. We all enjoyed this very much.
5.0,I made this for our Ladies Bible Study today and everyone luved it...i did make a few changes because i needed it to make a lager casserole...i used 12 eggs instead of six..my hash-browns was a 30 oz bag..and i added extra cheddar cheese to the top when it was done and left it just long enough 2 melt...we r big on Cheddar Cheese...Was Very Good...might try it another way next time r make as recipe calls 4 . i just needed a bigger casserole this mornin...Thanks 4 sharing ..Will be making it again !!!!!
5.0,This was very tasty and relatively easy to make. Made with bacon and next time I will try the breakfast sausage.
5.0,"I made this for my husband the other night. He LOVED it. Instead of the cottage cheese, I added a little more shredded cheese and extra hash browns. I also cut up an extra tomato I had laying around and threw some green, orange and red peppers on tops just for color. Was soooo good! Will make it again, very soon!!"
5.0,"This is a great recipe!  One reviewer said hers turned out dry.  Gas and electric ovens don&#39;t cook the same.  For anything you cook, if you&#39;re using a gas oven, lower the temp. by 15 degrees."
5.0,I made this for my kids this morning and they both gave me 2 thumbs up!! Easy and delicious.
5.0,Easy and delicious!
5.0,"I can honestly say that I have not yet tried this recipe, but my husband and I love brunch. I am Amish decendent (Yoder) and they have the best country and simple brunch dishes.I can tell just by readind the ingredient&#39;s that I will make this dish and have created my own simular to this recipe that it is a hit!"
5.0,I prepared  this for our family Christmas breakfast. My family devoured it.   It is so easy.  I made it the night before and refrigrated it and put it in the oven to cook while we opened presents.  It was great.  I added cubed ham to it; it was delicious.  It is now on the menu for next year.
5.0,Everyone in the family thought it was very good. Next time will sub mozza cheese for the swiss.
5.0,"I substituted sausage for the bacon and omitted the onions, and received rave reviews on Christmas morning.  It&#39;s a keeper!"
5.0,Our family loves this.
5.0,"This is my new favorite breakfast casserole. Great as written, or do as we do and add in other meats &amp; veggies we have on hand. The cottage cheese in it adds creamy goodness."
5.0,I made this on Xmas Eve to serve Xmas Morning...VERY Good...It is already slotted for the menu for Xmas 2011!
5.0,My husband LOVED this dish!  He said it needs to replace our annual tradition of Breakfast Pie (see other Taste of Home recipe) for Christmas breakfast.
5.0,Looked this up a few days before Christmas when seraching for breakfast idaes.  We really liked this -- made it for Christmas breaksfast for the fisrt time AND it had nice presentation for guests.  Very easy to make!  I reduced the onion (used sweet onion) because I don&#39;t really care for onions.  I will make again ~ thanks!
5.0,"This recipe is the same one I found in a quilters cookbook several years ago. I make it all the time.  I like the sausage, but I also use Canadian bacon.  It&#39;s easier and a little less fat. Give it a try.  We like this recipe with pancakes."
5.0,I have had this recipe from Taste of Home years ago and it is a staple in my family.  It feeds alot of people and everyone loves it.  I use chives or scallions instead of onion.
5.0,I have made this for Christmas morning the last 3 years in a row.  Delicious for breakfast or dinner.
5.0,Has anyone ommited the cottage cheese and used something else? I have one in the family that if they see cottage cheese they won&#39;t use it. Would ricotta cheese work?
5.0,"This recipe is delicious. To the person who would like to substitute Ricotta instead of cottage cheese, that would work fine also but since Ricotta is alot more expensive you might consider just putting your cootage cheese through a food processor or blender and your cottage cheese hater will not know the difference."
5.0,"I made this recipe for a special family brunch and it was the absolute best!  I used 1 1/2 pounds of sausage and 12 eggs.  Instead of Swiss cheese I used a colby/jack mix. To make sure it was spicey enough I added a pinch of cayenne pepper.   Even with these additions, it served only 8.  This is my new favorite brunch recipe"
5.0,We fix this recipe often.  It is great to prepare it the night before and bake it in the morning.  Try this with sausage or ham!  My family loves this recipe!
5.0,"Excellent casserole, easy and delicious.  I cook for the young adults for our Church and this is one of their favorite dishes."
5.0,It&#39;s a favorite at home and church.
5.0,"Had guests for breakfast on Sunday. 6 adults ate the entire pan! I used one lb. of bulk italian sausage instead of bacon. I added two more eggs and I used the entire bag of potato&#39;s. This will become a regular dish at our house. When I shared this with a friend, she said this dish is safe for those with Celiac disease because - no bread."
5.0,This is the best. Wonderful flavor and so easy. Stir everything all together night before. Have tried many egg stratus and this is by far the best! Company all wanted the recipe!
5.0,"I&#39;ve made this many times.  Used ham, bacon, &amp; hot sausage.  I always use fresh potatoes.  For the lady that said her potatoes were brown, all you need to do is soak them in water as soon as you take them out of food processor.  It is so much cheaper this way instead of buying the frozen ones and I always have potatoes on hand."
5.0,"Loved this Recipe... My Daughter had a Birthday sleepover with 8 girls and this made enough for all of them, they loved and it was a good lower carb recipe as to one of the girls is a diabetic.  Needless to say that girls mom walked out the door with this recipe too."
5.0,"I make this at least once a month, however, I&#39;ve tweaked it to our liking.  I use a lb of bacon AND a lb of sausage...I also make my own homemade hashbrowns and brown them with onions.  We like them better if they are cooked to make them a little crunchier than the frozen ones used in the original recipe.  I also put 1/2 of the mixture in the pan and then put swiss slices and the rest on top, with cheddar to cover the top...Guess you could say all I use the recipe for anymore is a list of ingredients :)  But, it was awesome as it is written as well!"
5.0,"Wanted to try something new for x-mas morning, we&#39;ve had the same thing every year for a while. I made it early to give it a try and avery one loved it, even the kids."
5.0,Delicious!  Will make this again.  I didn&#39;t have fresh onion so i used minced instead and didn&#39;t have any swiss so i used extra cheddar.  MM MMM good.
5.0,"Have been making this for years we love it. I&#39;ve even used leftover spam,onion,green pepper and cheese which we use for a grilled sandwhich."
5.0,This was delicious.  I made it with ham instead of bacon since that was what I had on hand.  I also used tator tots and broke them up as that was what I had.  It needed to cook a bit extra as the tator tots were not completely thawed out.  It made me nervous at first as it didn&#39;t seem to be setting up but I just cooked it til a knife came out clean and it turned out great!
5.0,"Friends LOVED it! Used ham instead of bacon, and it was absolutely delicious!"
5.0,"Delicious cupcakes! Left out the cinnamon in the frosting. I had some pumpkin cookies that I put in the food processor and sprinkled on the top of the frosted cupcakes, were  amazing."
5.0,This recipe is SOOOO good!  I make it all the time for potluck breakfasts &amp; brunches!
5.0,"This is one of my favorites, we are on a cooking team with four other couples at St. Bartholomew&#39;s Episcopal Church in Wichita Kansas. Each week a team cooks breakfast every Sunday during the year.  My husband and I take turns choosing what we want to fix.  This is high on my list as the cottage cheese makes it so moist and delicious.I vary on the Cheddar cheese and use what I have on hand, sometimes I may add two or more different cheeses when I make a triple batch. I add different meats as well, to the casserole depending what is on sale at the store.  This is always a big hit with our parish of 45 people.We charge a $2.00 donation to cover the cost of the meal and what money is over the cost goes back to the Church. As my husband would say, &#34; The best $2.00 breakfast in town. Diane Chambers"
5.0,"I have made this recipe multiple times and our Ladies Sunday School Class asks for it everytime there is a ladies brunch, etc.   I use a pound of real bacon bits instead of cooking up bacon, dried onion pieces can be used in place of chopped onion, I increase the eggs to 12, use 1 package of shredded hash brown potatoes (16-20 oz package from the refrigerator section), I chop up sliced swiss cheese since I can never find shredded Swiss already packaged and make no changes on the cottage cheese.   This casserole is a big hit and by using some of the easier ways to get ingredients it is not hard to make.  I have never tried to freeze this but since I am making one for Sunday I may try freezing a small amount to see how it holds up."
5.0,I love this recipe. Every time I make it I have an empty pan. I like to fry the bacon and cut the onion up the night before to cut down on prep time in the morning.
5.0,This was delicious. I like sauteing my onions in the bacon drippings. I added chopped bell pepper and used the cheeses I had on hand (no swiss). It is an easy recipe and is easy to make changes to fit what is in your pantry.
5.0,"oh my.  this turned out just perfect!  I made a half batch, just in case we didn&#39;t care for it, and it was GONE in no time.  I&#39;ve been looking for a simple breakfast recipe to serve Thanksgiving morning and this is it!  I used breakfast sausage in place of the bacon and I skipped the onions on accident - still, it was just perfect.  It&#39;s like a cheesy quiche meets yummy scrambled eggs.  Thanks for sharing!"
5.0,The most delicious breakfast cassarole I&#39;ve ever made.
5.0,"we had 28 family members coming for breakfast on Christmas morning. So we had two different recipes to try and this one was a hit. No one had any idea cottage cheese was in it. I cooked the chopped onions with the bacon and used the freeze dried hashbrowns (just added the water and waited 10 min) and then added everything and baked. Next year we are only going to make this recipe! We added a ham, fresh fruit and a stuffed french toast casserole and everyone was happy!"
5.0,Excellent - really really good. I used kielbasa instead of bacon and it was fantastic. A hit with the entire family!
5.0,"Needed something for a birthday food day at work....this was easy, delicious and everyone loved it.  I highly recommend it."
5.0,My husband and I made this Amish Breakfast Casserole on Valentines Day for a family breakfast brunch.  Absolutely a hit!  Very good the next day too!
5.0,I made this recipe last weekend and LOVED it. I used sausage in place of bacon. This recipe will be tagged as one of our favorites.
5.0,"This casserole was fantastic! Will try sausage next time! I don&#39;t feel this recipe is 12 servings, as stated, I feel it&#39;s more like 8 or 9!"
5.0,I make this for brunch with the ladies. My good friend is wheat-intolerant. She loves this recipe.
5.0,I made these today. They were easy to make and the recipe was easy to follow. I am taking them to a party and I&#39;m sure everyone will love them. I&#39;m sure I will be making them year round. (We love pumpkin)
5.0,"These were awesome. I did however, fill them with a whipped cream and vanilla pumkin spiced pudding. It just added that wow factor"
5.0,"Yes, it is.  I have made it at approximately 5200 feet elevation with perfect results."
5.0,These were SOOO good.  I altered one thing.. only used 2C of powdered sugar in the icing and it was plenty sweet for us.  I will definitely make these again!!
5.0,"I didn&#39;t plan on baking today but I received this recipe in my email and wow, the cupcakes are amazing!  They didn&#39;t rise up much but thats ok, just eat another to make up for it.  I don&#39;t think I have ever baked a cake without vanilla extract and the batter recipe didn&#39;t call for it so I added some.  The added vanilla made the cupcakes almost too sweet, and I love sweet but next time I won&#39;t add any, there is already some vanilla in the frosting,  that is probably enough.  Also, this recipe made 2 dozen cupcakes plus a small bundt cake, you could easily get 3 dozen cupcakes from this recipe. I will definitely make this recipe again, it is a keeper!"
5.0,"We use less sugar in the frosting also,  and it&#39;s  still delicious.   Try with Craisins in the batter with the candied pecans on top!"
5.0,I think I&#39;ve established a new holiday staple in our home. I used my stand mixer and followed manufacturer&#39;s guidelines on speed and length of time for mixing ingredients at each step of the way. The cupcakes came out tender and fluffy. A definite hit with my family and another family we shared with. We will definitely cook these again during pumpkin season.
5.0,"Very moist. Light texture. Delicious. Only fault with this recipe is that it was entirely too much frosting. Next time, I will make half as much frosting. Great recipe. Made 27 cupcakes."
5.0,These were so good.  I only used 3 cups of confectioners sugar but probably could have gotten away with 2 cups and I only used 1 tsp Cinnamon in the frosting because I didn&#39;t want the cinnamon to over power it.  I have frosting left over &amp; may make another batch to give away.
5.0,This is an AMAZING recipe! I’m gonna be the hero this Thanksgiving! So so perfect in every way! That little bit of ginger is genius!
5.0,"Best cupcakes ever! I am not usually a fan of pumpkin, so I really just made these for my family....but I love them!  We have now made them several times and they are delicious.  The only change we make is leaving out the ginger because we thought it might be too strong in the cupcakes."
5.0,"Absolutely love these! We have these for every birthday now, not just in fall"
5.0,"I love to bake, but I had never made banana bread until Thanksgiving of 2010. It turned out awful. It wasn&#39;t sweet enough or have enough banana flavor to suit me. I didn&#39;t give up, I saw this recipe on your website and tried it. It is magnificent! My family loved it so much they wanted loafs for their Christmas gifts. I pretty much have to make it about every week now. My co-workers love it. My friends at church love it. It is truly the best ever banana bread, and easy to make. Thanks for publishing this recipe!! Kristine from Anthony, Kansas"
5.0,"Incredible!!I had to make a few changes - I didn&#39;t have buttermilk, and ran out of vinegar and lemon juice to make buttermilk, so I used 1/4 cup of 1% milk and added 1 tbsp of orange juice to it - I also used 3 large bananas (so important that they are partially green, not completely ripe!) - and I also added 1/4 cup of ground flax seed as well. I also reduced the sugar from 1 1/2 cups to just 1 cup - although you could still reduce it more. I added a dash of nutmeg, a dash of ground cloves, and about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I really enjoyed reading everyone&#39;s reviews and suggestions too! It helped me with making my own changes - thanks for a great starting point with this recipe - it&#39;s a keeper!"
5.0,I forgot to mention - I used canola oil instead of vegetable oil :-)
5.0,"These disappear at my house with 3 kids.  I did substitute sour cream for the buttermilk and made them as muffins cooking at 325 degrees for 25-30 minutes.   They are a hit!  I hate to admit it, but I even threw away the old family recipe for this one!"
5.0,"This banana bread is delicious. I never made banana bread before, but others I&#39;ve tried have always been kind of dry. This one is so moist and wonderful. I used 3 bananas, powdered buttermilk, 1/2 cup each of nuts and choc. chips, and a touch of cinnamon. So good, very moist, and delicious. I&#39;ll make this again for sure."
5.0,"amazing!!!! seemed like the outside of mine was getting very dark, wile the middle was still a bit to moist? anyone know why that would be? I followed the recipe with no changes."
5.0,This is an amazing recipe! Probably the best banana bread I&#39;ve had. My husband who doesn&#39;t even like banana bread very much liked this recipe. The outside is crunchy right after it comes out of the oven but then it softens after it cools so I didn&#39;t think it was too crispy at all.
5.0,"It was so good I made it twice in one night, I had to share this with others.  So I made one for my daughters house."
5.0,Super flavor! Moist and yummy:)
5.0,"I made this last night, and it truely is the best banana bread recipe ever.  I did a few things differently.  I added 3 bananas plus some cinammon.  I didn&#39;t have any buttermilk, but I did pour in some organic soy milk.  It was so moist on the inside and a nice texture on the outside.  Will definitely pass around and make this again :)"
5.0,"I often make this bread - it is so yummy. As in every bread I bake, I substitute applesauce for the oil and use about 1/2 the sugar. The last time I baked this, added white chocolate chips - that was really good."
5.0,"I have a &#34;family favorite&#34; banana bread recipe which is probably still the ultimate favorite, however, this bread is excellent as well.  And the reason I like it so much is that it is much lower in fat than the old family version.   For having only 1/2 cup of oil, in what turns out to be a very large loaf, I thought this was an exceptionally moist and flavorful bread.    I used 3 bananas instead of 2 since it was suggested by so many other reviewers.   Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly skipping only the nut since my family doesn&#39;t care for them.  Mine actually tested done after 1 hr and 10 mins.   The outer crust was slightly crunchy but not hard.    Will definitely keep this recipe and make it again."
5.0,"I am always looking for a great banana bread recipe and I have found it.  This was delicious and very moist.  I used 3 bananas, added chocolate chips, and used milk and vinegar instead of the buttermilk.  Will definitely be making this one again."
5.0,Awesome taste.  My family loved these.  I had enough left over to make a small pumpkin loaf.  Next time I am going to make this as loaves instead of cupcakes.
5.0,"The cupcakes and icing turned out great. I doubled the recipe but instead of using 5 cups of sugar for the cupcakes, I only used 3. It came out perfectly sweet with the 3 cups."
5.0,My daughter won her cooking competition with these! They taste fantastic. Highly reccomend.
5.0,"I made these a few weeks ago and have many requests for more and for the recipe. Making them this weekend for a pot luck dinner. Think I will make copies of the recipes to hand out, I know I&#39;ll be asked."
5.0,"I made these for a bake sale, and they were a huge hit!"
5.0,I&#39;ve made this recipe about five times and it comes out beautifully each time. I even made it for my sister&#39;s wedding and everyone loved it. The cupcakes are a little denser than a regular cupcake but i like them that way.
5.0,These are the best!
5.0,"So good I&#39;m making these for my fall wedding!! Making sure the butter and cream cheese are at room temp helped ensure a silky smooth frosting. The spice level in both the frosting and the cupcake is spot on. The cupcakes have fresh, pure ingredients so they&#39;re heavier/denser than box mix cupcakes. These are on my Top 5 Cupcakes list!"
5.0,"I used all organic ingredients.  My husband gave these two thumbs up and said, &#39;intense pumpkin flavor!&#39;  Next time I make them, I will add raisins to the batter, and sprinkle crushed candied pecans over the frosting.  Superb cupcakes and an easy recipe!  Happy Fall, y&#39;all!"
5.0,"This recipe is absolute perfection. I brought The cupcakes to a bake sale at work and couldn’t have gotten better reviews. I used powdered buttermilk, mixed in with the dry ingredients rather than liquid buttermilk, but the consistency was excellent; perfectly moist. These are perfect for Fall and I will make them over and over."
5.0,"Hi - I&#39;m about to try these out. Do you use salted or unsalted butter?Update: Used salted butter - these are the best cupcakes I have ever cooked by far, and I&#39;m not even a pumpkin fan! The pumpkin flavor is light and it balances so well with the cinammon cream cheese frosting! Thank you so much - I will be making these every fall for the rest of my life"
5.0,These are  absolutely delicious. It is one of my favorite fall cakes to make. The cake has a nice spice and it&#39;s not dry. The cinnamon in the cream cheese frosting is the perfect finishing touch.
5.0,I made these last night..Followed the recipe completely. Didn&#39;t change a thing. They were amazing...I made them for my husband for work. They were gone quick he said. I will for sure be making these again.
5.0,"This is the perfect autumn recipe!  The cake is moist and boasts a mild pumpkin flavor that is perfectly spiced.  The tang of the cream cheese frosting is mellowed with the warmth of cinnamon.  The combination is divine!  I made two 11X13 sheet cakes.  I stacked one on top of the other with a thin layer of icing in between and a layer of frosting on top.  It was devoured and all who tried it, loved it!"
5.0,"I don&#39;t like pumpkin but this was absolutely amazing! I work at a restaurant and on busy weekends I take in cupcakes. I tried this and it was a winner, even I had seconds. This recipe is fantastic and I can&#39;t wait to make them again. Thank you so much for sharing!"
5.0,Delicious! Followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing.1 tbsp of pumpkin pie spice =1 1/2 tsp cinnamon1/2 tsp ground nutmeg1/2 tsp ground ginger1/4 tsp ground cloves
5.0,Very good! Made these  and gave some to my neighbors. All good comments!  I am so making these again. I added some sugared ginger instead of regular ginger.
5.0,I don&#39;t normally make comments but these cupcakes were so good that I had to! The flavors all blend together well and the cupcakes are super moist. I am not a huge fan of pumpkin but I loved these. These are great cupcakes for Thanksgiving!
5.0,Made these today and they are wonderful.  They are moist and very flavorful.  Frosting taste great with the cinnamon added.  Will definitely make again.
5.0,I was told by several people at my husbands work that these were the best cupcakes they have ever eaten in their life!! Very moist but yet stay together and don&#39;t fall apart. The icing was definitely a winner as well :)
5.0,Moist and delicious. Just as good as all the great reviews stated. I will definitely be keeping this one!
5.0,Everyone absolutely loved them and begged me for the recipe. I made according to recipe as written.
5.0,I have been making these for years an they are always the talk of the party. The only thing that I do different is use one big can of 29oz of pumpkin instead of 15oz and it just makes it so much more moist and more pie like.
5.0,These are delicious!!  Very moist &amp; the icing made them-these are the best pumpkin cupcakes ever!
5.0,Very moist and tastey. The frosting was delicious and the added cinnamon topped it off. My boyfriend who is not even a big sweets person ate them 2 days in a row and my kids LOVED them. Even better the next day!
5.0,After I submitted my review I saw it was for the Pumpkin Cupcakes and not the Pumpkin cookies!!!! So sorry!  I did make these cupcakes also and they are scrumptious!
5.0,Delicious!  I&#39;ve made these several times and have taken to work.  Everyone raves about them and comes looking for more!  My children also love them!  People who don&#39;t like pumpkin have tried them and say they are awesome!
5.0,"I love this recipe but I didn&#39;t actually go ingredient by ingredient. I accidentally forgot to add the canned pumpkin lol. I was ready to throw the batch out but to my surprise the cupcakes were very tasty. I even added a crumb topping to some. I did add a bit more buttermilk, cinnamon and pumpkin spice to my batch. I also omitted the ginger. I will be making this again and hopefully this time I will not forget the pumpkin."
5.0,"These cupcakes are amazing!  The only thing I changed was reducing the sugar to 2 cups.  I thought 2 1/2 would be a little too sweet for my taste and I think I was right, cause they turned out perfectly sweet.  I can&#39;t say enough about how good these are.  The spices are spot on and I love that it calls for butter (I won&#39;t use vegetable oil or shortening). Yum!"
5.0,"Delicious, moist, and baked up beautifully. Gorgeous orange hue to them too. I used my own recipe for cream cheese frosting, and added a bit of maple syrup for a flavor twist. Great recipe!"
5.0,Mmm Mmm GREAT!
5.0,I made this cake on 10/13/13. this is one of the best cake I&#39;ve had. It&#39;s very MOIST and I love it. I just change one thing and that was the ginger I added allspice instead. Love It!!!!!!!!!!!!
5.0,I didn&#39;t try the cream cheese frosting recipe provided but instead bought the coolwhip cream cheese frosting in the freezer section. Added 1tsp cinnamon and it was so light and fluffy not overpowering sweet. Less calories and sugar. Yum!
5.0,By far the best recipe for pumpkin cupcakes I have ever tried!  I have made these for the fall season for many years and they are a favorite of my family.
5.0,These were the best! Made these for an office party and they didn&#39;t last very long.
5.0,These were great!
5.0,very good and moist - love the icing!!
5.0,Just made these for Harvest Day at work. They are very tasty!
5.0,"Love, love, love this recipe!"
5.0,"Love these cupcakes, they were a hit! How long would I have to bake these in a loaf pan!?"
5.0,These are the best ever!!!
5.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE
5.0,Terrific recipe - think they are even better the next day!  Without the frosting they make a wonderful muffin!  :-)
5.0,I made these for a teachers luncheon and kept a dozen for my family. I haven&#39;t heard anything back yet from the teachers or PTA but the ones in my house were gone within 2 days! They are moist and taste like pumpkin pie in a wrapper! I am making again today to take to a friend who just had a baby and we will keep the rest! Yum!
5.0,"This is a fabulous recipe! My friend wanted a good seasonal cupcake recipe after she volunteered to bake desserts for another friend&#39;s November baby shower. I volunteered to help, and after baking a test batch, we made just a couple of alterations. For the &#34;pumpkin spice&#34; we used fresh ground cloves and nutmeg, about a tablespoon and a half total of approximately equal parts nutmeg and clove, and we increased the cinnamon by a half teaspoon.For my palate, I&#39;d add even more spice in the future, likely the nutmeg and clove, but generally the spice level seems good for most people. I decreased the amount of sugar in the frosting by a half cup, and might even reduce it by a full cup in the future, along with adding about 1/4 cup more cream cheese. We also added about 1/2 to 3/4 of a vanilla bean (split the bean and scrape out), along with the cinnamon, which made it a really rich tasting frosting.If you have a pastry bag with decorative frosting tips you can frost them that way, and  the cupcakes look professionally made, nice to take to parties and holiday events. To top them off we sprinkled finely chopped candied ginger on top of the finished frosting."
5.0,I don&#39;t usually bake but stumbled across this recipe while searching for a pumpkin dessert.  I live at 8K feet so cakes are a real challenge!  This is delicious and easy.  I followed it and added half a walnut to the tops.  It made exactly 24 perfect cupcakes and the frosting was the right amount.  I took them for dessert to a gathering and they were a huge hit!
5.0,"Not only is this recipe simple, it is absolutely fabulous. These home made cupcakes come out perfect every time, with just the right amount of spice. The are moist and delish!  The icing is the perfect compliment to these tasty morsels... I will make them again and again."
5.0,Everyone loved them I&#39;m making them again for Thanksgiving.
5.0,"These were fantastic!  Everyone who has tried them wants more than one.  The recipe made 2 dozen cupcakes, but in the future think I will cut the frosting in half.  There was A LOT of it left over."
5.0,simple and delicious! The spiced frosting was the star of these cupcakes. I topped mine with a few slivered almonds as a nice garnish. Great recipe!
5.0,"These cupcakes have rave reviews for a reason, they are amazing. You won&#39;t regret it if you try them!"
5.0,"I made these cupcakes four time over the Thanksgiving holiday for friends and family.  They are unbelieveable.  Huge reviews from all.  I did add more pumpkin spice and cinnamon to batter.  Also added more cinnamon to frosting.  Wonderful, moist and delicious.  This is a keeper recipe!"
5.0,"Fantastic cupcakes!! They were a huge hit and people keep asking me for the recipe. Instead of pumpkin pie spice i just added some extra cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves.  These cupcakes really taste like a pumpkin pie, not just a spice cake. Loved the frosting as well, the cinammon adds that extra special taste. Would definitely recommend  trying."
5.0,"Easy to make, moist, and delicious!"
5.0,"This disappeared at our family Christmas Dinner.  Easy to make (I cheated and used Whipped Cream Cheese frosting though) and very tasty.  They don&#39;t puff up a lot, so fill the cups full - the cake is fairly heavy, but a good consistency.  I will definitely be making these again!"
5.0,Excellent flavor and really easy. I was able to substitute Greek yogurt for the buttermilk and my cupcakes were great and perfectly moist. I was also able to do it without an electric mixer so that&#39;s a plus!
5.0,just made for the 1st time for my county fair extension project and walked away with Grand Champion!  :)  Only thing I did different was the frosting because of cream cheese restrictions- so used a buttercream instead with a touch of cinnamon added- but this recipe is to die for!  SOOOO moist! and I&#39;m not a huge pumpkin fan but these are great! Would HIGHLY recommend!  They also make about 30 cupcakes so for a big batch - great recipe.  Maybe for just my family I might cut in half.
5.0,seriously the best cupcakes ive ever made.
5.0,"I&#39;ve had this recipe for a while but didn&#39;t make them until this year. Boy did I regret that! These were the best cupcakes I&#39;ve ever made. My boyfriend won&#39;t let me share them with anybody! I brought them to work and everyone wanted the recipe. I&#39;ll be making these every year for the rest of my life, more than likely. : )"
5.0,This recipe was yum-o. Loved the cinnamon spice in it. Gave some to the fire house and they loved them too.Will make them again
5.0,"Worth the work!I used homemade pumpkin puree (1 3/4 cup) instead of the canned pumpkin, made my own pumpkin pie spice, and used soured milk instead of the buttermilk.I think the recipe needed a little less liquid on the day I made it, but I went against my better judgement and used all the recipe called for. Thus, the cupcakes didn&#39;t set fast enough in the oven and had &#34;hat brims&#34; of batter that cooked over the top of the liners instead of rising in a nice dome.I also made half of the frosting (as suggested by previous reviewers) and it covered all 30 (not 24 as the recipe claims) cupcakes nicely. The frosting tasted very good despite the fact that it calls for (what I think is) a lot of cinnamon.As to why frosting might not be setting up (as mentioned by Alie0717): If you make cream cheese frosting with low-fat (Neufchatel cheese) or fat-free cream cheese, it doesn&#39;t have the fat required to whip up and set the frosting. Soupy cream cheese frosting can be fixed by using only full-fat or regular cream cheese. Remember, the cream cheese is replacing butter in quick buttercream frosting to make cream cheese frosting."
5.0,Great cupcakes! I cut the frosting in half as suggested by other users but ran out with 4 cupcakes left. I decorated the cupcakes exactly as pictured. I would suggest making a full batch of the frosting and freezing any leftovers for future baking projects. It is delicious!
5.0,Yummy and so cute!
5.0,I simply loved these cupcakes. Delicious and very easy the one thing I did to improve them was add 2 tablespoons of grade A maple syrup to the frostings to kick up the fall flavors. Also to anyone having trouble with to runny frosting your butter or cream cheese was to soft!!
5.0,I thought this recipe was great. I put hershey&#39;s cinnamon and premier white chips in them as well and they turned out great!
5.0,Followed this recipe exactly and they are AMAZING!!!!
5.0,"I buy a small container of buttermilk, use what I need and freeze the rest in 1 cup increments in labeled freezer bags..lay them flat til they freeze then you can stand them up for easier storage"
5.0,The BEST dessert I&#39;ve ever had!  They are mouth watering and you can&#39;t just have one.
5.0,Wow!  These are amazing!  I used 1/4 C applesauce and 1/2 cup butter as opposed to 3/4 C butter.  They are so moist and flavorful! Thanks for sharing!!
5.0,easy to make and a huge hit!
5.0,These got my finicky husband&#39;s stamp of approval as an acceptable substitute for pumpkin roll at Thanksgiving.  I piped the frosting on with a star tip as shown and had a lot left over.  Will make a half-batch of frosting next time.
5.0,"Incredible recipe.  Used fresh pumpkin, came out so moist and rich.  Used leftover frosting on everything, including cheesecake and pumpkin pie."
5.0,"I have made this recipe and have reviewed already, I was wondering if anyone has made this as a bread using loaf pans? Its SO good as cupcakes, I would love to make it as bread, any input appreciated, thanks!! :-)"
5.0,These get rave reviews every time I make them!
5.0,wonderfull taste and texture
5.0,"I made these cupcakes for a holiday party and everyone loved them. I made it exactly according to the recipe. This could definitely make about 30 cupcakes if you wanted to stretch it. Instead of the stars like the picture, I used a round tip to make a swirl design that turned out really cute."
5.0,"This recipie is always a winner at my house.  It&#39;s also popular for school bake sales and events.  I have had friends who do not like pumpkin eat these up and ask for seconds.   They might not like pumkin pie, but this pumpkin spice cupcake is a winner!"
5.0,Everyone was so impressed when I made these--LOVE THEM!!
5.0,"My daughter made these and they were devine! She used nutmeg for ginger since we didn&#39;t have any. And instead of buying buttermilk for this one recipe, she used the milk/vinegar substitute. Wonderful!! I hope she makes these again!"
5.0,made these cupcakes tonight and my son and i loved them!!!! will definetively make again. thanks for sharing.
5.0,This recipe is AWESOME!!! I&#39;ve made it twice now and both times it has come out moist and delicious...It has awesome texture...light and fluffy!  This is my new go to recipe for cupcakes for sure!
5.0,Delicious and so moist! I added about 1/2 cup of applesauce to make them extra moist and they taste great!
5.0,<p>These cupcakes are awesome!</p>
5.0,"These pumpkin cupcakes are undeniable the best we have ever had. A little &#34;heavy&#34; but very moist and the flavor is just perfect. After reading comments about not getting the &#34;peak&#34; on the frosting, I set my frosting bag in the fridge for about an hour before using and it harden up enough to create beautiful peaks!! I will definately be making these again and again."
5.0,Delicious! Better than I expected!
5.0,"Took these to work this morning, they didn&#39;t even make it to 1st break!!  All man environment, they thought they were completely outstanding and want me to make more for tomorrow!  Good Stuff!"
5.0,These are awesome! I iced these as mummies for our school fair. Everyone loved them!!!!
5.0,These cupcakes came out very moist and delicious. I only used 3 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar in the frosting recipe and a teaspoon of the cinnamon. Though next time I will use the full 2 teaspoons of cinnamon in the frosting next time.
5.0,"I made these last week and decorated them to look like pumpkins. Looked cute and tasted amazing!! They were a hit and I&#39;ll prolly make them again tonight since I have so much leftover frosting... And I colored the frosting orange to look like a pumpkin so if I don&#39;t use it now, I probably never will"
5.0,Great recipe! Very moist and easy to make. Big hit with my family :) will definitely make again.
5.0,I make this recipe for my Bunko ladies and these cupcakes were a huge hit!!! One lady said it was the best cupcake she had ever eaten. All asked for the recipe. Very easy to make and will make over and over.
5.0,These cupcakes are amazing. My husband who rarely comments on my cooking asked where I have been hiding this recipe and my 9 yr old daughter asked if I could make them for her class. Followed recipe exactly. Swirled frosting on with pampered chef accent decorator. Have had several people ask for the recipe.
5.0,I&#39;ve never had so many compliments and requests for recipes as I&#39;ve had with these yummy cupcakes!  They were a hit with adults as well as kids at our church potluck.  It tends to make more than 24 cupcakes which was fine with me!  Definately a keeper in my recipe box!!
5.0,These cupcakes are so delicious! Everybody that tried them said they were the best cupcakes they ever had. I will definitely make these cupcakes again.
5.0,delish! the icing is fantastic!
5.0,Everyone I gave a cupcake to LOVED it! They were by far some of the best cupcakes I have ever had! I have already made them twice and plan on making them again for the holidays.
5.0,These are so moist and tasty and pretty too!  I make these whenever I have guests over during the fall season!
5.0,Made this in the fall and took them to work. Everyone raved over them. Very moist and delicious!
5.0,My kids loved this.  My 4 year old wasn&#39;t so sure when I put the canned pumpkin in but loved it in the end.  Everyone said they were good.
5.0,"These are amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A hit at my work for our potluck! But one question......have made these a few times but, never have been able to peak the frosting? Is the picture with canned frosting? Anyone else have this problem.....either way the frosting is still amazing, its just spread on there!"
5.0,I have made these twice and they are a huge hit! Easy to make and delicious! They will make your kitchen smell yummy!
5.0,I made these for a party I was hosting on a chilly fall evening and they were fantastic and a huge hit! They turned out very moist and the flavor was wonderful. I cut the frosting recipe in half and am glad I did because this was plenty. I tried them with and without the frosting and liked them both ways. The frosting is not necessary but really does make them just a little more special. They went well with the spiced hot apple cider I served and I will make these again.
5.0,"Made these for a get together yesterday, they were fabulous!   However, Sledchick, my frosting was spreadable I couldn&#39;t get it to peak either.  But still very delicious!"
5.0,I would suggest trying a piping bag with a star tip if it seems too soft put in freezer for a few mins to harden it some and that may help  Hope this works for you
5.0,These cupcakes were so easy and delicious! Perfect for fall :)
5.0,these   cupcakes  were  a  great  hit.......   got  the  recipe  from  my  friends  son  when  he  posted  it  on  his   facebook  page   enjoy.........going  to  make  them  again  this  year....
5.0,These  cupcakes  are  GREAT ....  Made  these  last year   for  the  1st  time They  were  a  bit  hit....  will  make  them  again  this  year  ......ENJOY....
5.0,Awesome!
5.0,"I used a different frosting, but the cupcakes are very moist and tasty."
5.0,This was delicious!  Even though the frosting was a little liquidy it still had a great flavor.  The cupcake itself was great!  we&#39;ll definitely make this again.
5.0,"Yummy, moist, tasty cupcakes.  I made 2 batches...one for us (some to freeze) and one for the potluck at church today.  Everyone loved them and complemented on the spicy flavor and tasty cinnamon frosting.  I just spread the frosting on top.  It firms up after sitting for awhile!  So good.  I&#39;ll make them again and again."
5.0,This is hands down the best banana bread I have ever eaten or made. It is my new go-to recipe (since last year). I get many and often requests at church to bring it to any get-together and to make it for bakesales. Amazing!
5.0,"I made this today and its amazing! It is by far the best recipe I have tried, this is definitely a keep."
5.0,Probably the best Banana Bread recipe I have found.  My kids loved it and it was gone in a few hours!  Aside from omitting the nuts I didn&#39;t change a thing in the recipe.
5.0,Made as written.  It looked overcooked but tasted wonderful.  Has a nice dark sugarery crust (is that a word?)
5.0,I have had this recipe since the 70&#39;s.  It was in the Bon Appetite magazine.  Excellent banana bread.
5.0,"This bread is absolutely delicious! I agree with the title, it is the BEST EVER banana bread! I leave out the nuts and add a bit more banana, but other than that it&#39;s perfect as is :)"
5.0,[Wow - what happened to all the reviews I saw here a week or 2 ago? There&#39;s only 1 review showing here now.] This IS the BEST banana bread - no kidding! Use 3 bananas to have an overflowing cupful. (I used an aluminum-colored loaf pan.) You will love it! -Lori in WI.
5.0,Ethis recipEveryone loved this recipe when i made it for mothers day. It really is the &#34;Best Ever Banana Bread &#34;    Cathleen Woodall of Flordia
5.0,I make this bread anytime there are ripe bananas on hand!  The buttermilk makes this bread moist and flavorful.
5.0,"I make this 5 batches at a time, or with a family of 6 I wouldn&#39;t get a slice at all! I make them &amp; give them as birthday gifts for all my friends, everyone looks forward to their birthday, since the know they&#39;ll get a loaf!"
5.0,"This really is the Best Ever Banana Bread.  I made this when the recipe was first published in Taste of Home 1992, and have made it ever since and given the recipe to many who tasted and loved it.  Thank you for the good recipe."
5.0,I had 6 bananas that needed to be used so I made 3 loaves. It turned out so good! All three loaves look beautiful. I did add 2/3 tsp of banana extract because I like a little more banana flavor than is usually in banana breads. I&#39;m glad I came across this recipe because it&#39;s definatley a keeper.
5.0,"Great recipe!  The buttermilk is what caught my eye, adds a great moistness.  Have made it several times, but make it into muffins.  Freeze them in packs of two, great to take to work for breakfast or mid-morning snack!  Hint--freeze &#34;too ripe&#34; bananas in their skins in a zipper freezer bag. Take out one or two for a recipe, thaw for a few seconds in the microwave, pinch off the stem end and squeeze the banana right out of the skin!!"
5.0,This truly is the BEST EVER!  It is easy to make and fantastic.  It&#39;s a hit every time!
5.0,This certainly lives up to its name.  My very good recipe of banana bread just got replaced by the Best Ever Banana Bread Recipe.  Thanks.
5.0,This turned out beautifully!  The frosting is a wonderful compliment to the full flavored cupcake.
5.0,Great recipe! My husband always asks for these. I only make half the frosting and it is always more than enough.
5.0,OMGosh!!!!  This is a killer cupcake recipe!  Absolutely love it!!  I won&#39;t make any other pumpkin flavored cupcake now.  This one is too good and the frosting is d-lish!  The cinnamon really adds something special!!  YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS RECIPE!!!
5.0,This is really great!  My family LOVES them.  They&#39;re great with or without the frosting.  Maybe I&#39;ll add raisens next time and skip the frosting.  The only thing that really needs to change on this recipe is the amount of frosting-way too much-I&#39;ll cut the amount in half next time.
5.0,Just made these yesterday.  My daughter and I ate one right out of the oven and they tasted like a slice of pumpkin pie!!  I did add the frosting and cut it in half per peoples suggestion and it was perfect.  They  made exactly 24 cupcakes.  I used my pampered chef cookie scoop (medium one) and it worked really well because the batter is kind of...puffy or frothy.  Sooo yummy.  My hubby thought the frosting was a little too overpowering.  He couldn&#39;t tell they were pumpkin cupcakes till i told him.  But still loved them.
5.0,This was by far the best cupcake I have ever made!!  it turned out absolutely perfect and the cinnamon in the frosting was an excellent touch.  I made them for my son&#39;s birthday and they were a huge hit!!
5.0,"Loved this recipe. I used fresh pumpkin that I cooked, I added chocolate chips, which my husband loved."
5.0,This is excellent and super easy to make.  If you do make a double batch (i.e. 48 cupcakes) don&#39;t bother doubling the icing there is way too much left over as it is.
5.0,I made these cupcakes as one of  four selections for my daughters wedding and now everyone is asking for the recipe.  I got  more compliments on this recipe than any of the others flavors.  They really are super delicious and I am not really a fan of pumpkin.  I did use my own cream cheese frosting recipe though.  I will definetly make again and again.
5.0,"This recipe is delicious- everyone in the office loved them! I made everything per the directions except for the icing. I didn&#39;t want an overwhelming cinnamon flavor so I only used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and it came out perfectly. I&#39;m very pleased with the recipe. [And yes, I also had extra batter and icing- I just used a 5&#34; round and made a small cake.]"
5.0,These are GREAT and very delicious! I used only 2 cups of sugar in the frosting and it was not too sweet but just right! I made thse for my husband&#39;s potluck for work and got an amazing 48 cupcakes from this recipe! awesome! I will make these again for Thanksgiving instead of my pumpkin roll!
5.0,very moist and not overly sweet.
5.0,"EXCELLENT! I have also found that when pumplin is not available, candied yams work just as great!"
5.0,These were delicious! I made them for my belgian friend and she loved them! It was here first ever cupcake and it was a huge hit.  They are super moist and I used the leftover icing on warmed banana nut bread! WOW!
5.0,Reviewed Nov. 23 by BirdladyThey were great went over well at our Church Thanksgiving dinner. I sprinkled toasted pecans on top of the frosting which gave them a little crunch and special taste.
5.0,I made these cupcakes yesterday and used fresh pumpkin that I had just baked and pureed.  I used the same amount as a can of pumpkin.  They turned out great.  Nice and moist.  I used buttercream frosting and added cinnamon to the icing.  Will definitely make again.
5.0,FABULOUS. High in fat though. Took it to a party. Nods of approval everywhere.
5.0,"Yes, I substituted milk and lemon juice also for the buttermilk. Some collapsed and some didn&#39;t. Don&#39;t know why. They still were a hit."
5.0,A KEEPER!  These were so moist!  I made exactly as directed with no substitutions and they were perfect.  Sprinkled ground pecans on top...DDDD-lish!
5.0,"Very Moist and rich, a little heavy-as mine did not raise well, they seem to spread out over the top of the muffin tin, I would use non stick spray on the top before I put my cupcake liners in.  I also put frosting in ziploc bag, snipped corner and squeezed out the frosting on each cupcake.  This cut my frosting time in half."
5.0,First time making these cupcakes and they came out great!  Everyone at worked loved them.  Followed recipe exactly and it does truly make 24 cupcakes.  The frosting was wonderful - to die for.  In fact I kept a few cupcakes without the frosting and they were equally as good!
5.0,I made this for &#34;Girls Night Out&#34; and everyone loved them!!!!!
5.0,Delish.Everybody loved them.
5.0,"5 stars for the cupcakes but I added more cinnamon. The frosting was, to me, sickening sweet! WAY too much sugar for me.....but that&#39;s my taste."
5.0,My friends and my husband&#39;s coworkers loved these! I&#39;m definitely taking them to the in-laws&#39; for Thanksgiving!
5.0,My six year old son made these cupcakes for a potluck and they were a hit.  Everyone was asking him for the recipe.
5.0,These are so yummy! I made them for my 4 year old&#39;s halloween party (not such a tough crowd) and they were all gone within the hour!
5.0,WOW!!!  Very easy and delicious!!!!  They don&#39;t last long!!!!  Will definitely be making again!!!
5.0,"These were amazing. I didn&#39;t have ginger, but substituted nutmeg, they still were fabulous! Can&#39;t wait to make more!"
5.0,"These cupcakes are delicious!  I will make them again for sure!  I followed the recipe exactly, and it made 24 large (not jumbo) cupcakes, as well as 16 mini cupcakes....  I also think they would make cute mini loaves!"
5.0,"I am a secretary for an elementary school and I made  a batch of these cupcakes to share with the staff at school.They were a big hit, and I had several requests for the recipe.  I will definately make these cupcakes again."
5.0,"These are really good.  I took they to work for our Halloween Party and everyone wanted the recipe.  Maybe I didn&#39;t fill the cups as much as recommended, because it made more than 2 dozen."
5.0,Won the office pot-luck with this great recipe! I think next time I&#39;ll add more cinnamon to the frosting. I also suggest that you keep the frosting @ room temprature until you&#39;re SURE you&#39;re finished with it as it&#39;s SUPER sticky and very hard to work with cold.
5.0,Great recipe....last reviewer states it only makes 36 not 48 cupcakes....look at the recipe specs again it states the recipe makes 24 cupcakes...I used an ice cream scoop to fill my tins 3/4 full and got 24 extremely large cupcakes.
5.0,Absolutely delish! My 5-yr old daughter just loved them too.  I plan on using the frosting recipe for my next batch of cinnamon rolls....
5.0,"Haven&#39;t made the recipe yet...  we have a Christmas bazaar this weekend coming up, and I&#39;ll make some regular size ones to sell and mini ones for the luncheon table.  Should sell out.  I love pumpkin... anything!!!"
5.0,"This was absolutely delish!   My whole family loved them, even the kids.   I made it a second time as a cake.  Takes at least twice the baking time as the cupcakes.  Well worth the wait.  Just wonderful.  It is not complicated, very easy to make."
5.0,Excellent!  I grated fresh nutmeg on the top of the cupcakes!  Beautiful and Delicious!
5.0,Every year I make this with Thanksgiving leftovers and every year I am so glad I did. I usually get 3-4 pies out of this recipe depending on the size I make and they freeze beautifully. I love always having one on hand for a night I don’t feel like cooking and can just pop one in the oven for a few hours and walk away.
5.0,This chicken pot pie recipe is really good! I got 2 pies out of it and had plenty of leftovers! My family loved it. Will definitely make this again ☺️
5.0,"This is at least the 4th time I have made this.  I use half the butter, and just a little over half the flour.  I add a pound of mushrooms, cooked down so as not to add liquid.  I use shallots instead of onion.   I then throw in a bunch of garlic, parsley, basil, a little marjoram.  No thyme.  Since it is just the two of us, I bake both, and after they have chilled I cut them into dinner slices, wrap them individually, and freeze them.  Stunningly delicious pot pie!"
5.0,"Best chicken pot pie recipe. Make your own crusts or buy them, but you will get FOUR pies if you follow the recipe, which is even better. Freeze em! Buy the deep dish ones too."
5.0,I&#39;ve made this many times.  This last time I made it i bagged the extra filling and stuck it in the fridge.....its been 3 days now I&#39;m wondering if uts still good to stick in a pie crust &amp; bake...... @aurthor if your seeing this I really gotta know.
5.0,"This was the first and only recipe that I&#39;ve used for chicken pot pie and absolutely love it! It was extremely easy to follow the recipe, and my entire family devours it every time! I subbed the milk out for almond milk and it was delicious. 

I thinned the mixture a little bit with some extra milk and chicken broth and the mixture turned out to have a really nice consistency."
5.0,"I made it exactly as written and it is so very good.  I can&#39;t imagine a better recipe, though this is the first homemade Pot Pie I&#39;ve made.  The comments about it being too thick, to me, are very unfounded.  I thought at first it was awfully thick, but the end result was perfection in my opinion.  I would not have wanted it any thinner, it would have been a mess!  This slices well and mmmmmm good!  You won&#39;t want to lose this recipe!"
5.0,"I dont like corn and peas so I upped the other vegetables and added celery. I also sautéed my chicken with thyme and rosemary, as well as added a tsp of rosemary to the filling. Pies came out amazing! I froze mine first and used them later, following the tips at the bottom."
5.0,"By far, the best chicken pot pie I have ever made.   While I followed recipe exactly as written, I did find I had to add a bit more milk.  Delicious"
5.0,This is my favorite pot pie recipe the only thing I change is the frozen veg I’m weird I prefer canned but tonight I still have fresh corn so I will use that but the best recipe seriously
5.0,"These are so easy and came out great. I made them in my Wilton leaf/pumpkin pans and they are just so cute and taste wonderful. I think they are the best cupcakes Ive made yet!!! Knightstown, IN"
5.0,MY family loved these cupcakes. I didn&#39;t even get a chance to frost them. The recipe is easy. The results are great.
5.0,"This is a great recipe but it only made 36 cupcakes, not 48. If I made them again I would cut the frosting recipe in half...WAY too much left over!"
5.0,Everybody had to take two because they were so delicious!
5.0,Definitely lives up to its name! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out amazing.
5.0,It was simply delicious!!! the taste of banana is very subtle
5.0,This is the absolute VERY VERY BEST of all banana bread recipes. It is to die for!  Super moist and flavorful and quite addicting!  So happy to have found this gem of a recipe!
5.0,easy to make and delicious!
5.0,Even more delish if you add chocolate chips! I&#39;ve made this several times and everyone always raves over it!
5.0,"This is a wonderful, simple recipe. However, the recipe does not call for the pan to be floured as well as greased. Mine stuck to the bottom of the pan, so in the future, I will either dust the pan with flour or use parchment paper."
5.0,I have made this bread over and over again! I have changed a few things to make it healthier: I use whole wheat flour and only 3/4 c. sugar. I also use applesauce instead of oil and add 1/4 c. flax seed. It definately lives up to its name!
5.0,This was brought to me as muffins after a motorcycle accident.  THEY ARE THE BEST!!!  I add extra nuts and more bananas but they always turn out great!!
5.0,"Have had this recipe from one of your magazines for a long, long time.  It&#39;s a family favorite...doesn&#39;t stay around long..it goes fast!"
5.0,use this recipe a lot for my daughter bake sales she had.every easy and moist bread.love it.
5.0,AWESOME!!! I have been baking for 30 plus years and this is the best banana bread!My son stationed in Japan loves to bake and I will send him this recipe
5.0,"We&#39;ve made this several times, and we love it!!! I&#39;ve made it with powdered buttermilk when I didn&#39;t have actual buttermilk and didn&#39;t want to wait until I went to the store;) There was very little difference."
5.0,Delicious!!!
5.0,"I followed this recipe to the T. I&#39;m making this for thanksgiving, my husband has been bagging me to make him some banana bread I am a regular subscriber of Taste of Home I knew where to search for the best recipe.. thank u for help making my husband happy!"
5.0,I made this for the for the first time last night... it won&#39;t be the last. I used Splenda Baking Blend for the sugar and it turned out fantastic. YUM!
5.0,This really is the best ever!  It lives up to its name.  I put some chocolate chips in it and my husband loved it. I will make this over and over again
5.0,The best recipe I’ve found! I used a deep dish pie pan and it came out beautifully. Will definitely make many times. Shared a photo of it with my daughter who asked me to make her one this weekend!
5.0,This is such an amazing recipe! Thank you so much.
5.0,I have been making this for the past three years and we love it.   The only thing I did not add was the thyme since my husband and I aren’t a fan of it.   Love the fact that I bake one and freeze one each time I make this recipe.
5.0,GREAT recipe.........Love the whole recipe....ONE CORRECTION...IT MADE 4 9 inch pies so either half the recipe or make sure you have a lot of freezer space or friends to give them too..LOL...
5.0,I have been making this chicken pot pie recipe for years now. I usually give the second one away. I&#39;ve gotten so many Compliments From this recipe. It is everyone&#39;s favorite. So scrumptious and delicious!
5.0,Easy delicious recipe! Loved the pie and making it
5.0,"This is easily the most delicious chicken pot pie i have made.   There IS a ton of filling.... roughly 4 1/2 cups per pie for a total of 9 cups of filling.  I only had 1 large pie pan, so i divided the filling in half with a 4 1/2 cup measure.  I will make the other when the dish is clean and freeze it then.  My house smells heavenly."
5.0,"Excellent recipe, easy to follow, delicious!! I like to sometimes add some bacon too…My son loves it!"
5.0,"This was a really great recipe!  So many recipes online these days are fails, but this worked perfectly!  For our family&#39;s preference, I used 1/2 cup butter instead of 1 cup.  The recipe still worked just fine with half the butter.  We also prefer a bit more seasoning, so I added a teaspoon of my poultry seasoning and some ground cayenne pepper, and snuck in a handful of julienned kale for a little extra nutrition. I&#39;m sure the seasoning in the recipe would be just fine as is though for most families.  The amount of filling this makes is plentiful - easily enough for two deep dish pie plates, but one could probably even do 3 shallow pie dishes.  I baked one pie and put the other in the freezer for another night.  My family loved this recipe.  Thank you for a reliable recipe that we will use again and again."
5.0,I have made this pot pie for several years!! My father in law LOVES it!! Thank you for a delicious addition to family traditions!!
5.0,Excellent!  I don&#39;t usually use recipes when I cook but this is a keeper. Will definitely make again.
5.0,I halved this recipe to make one perfect pie. I used chicken stock to cook my chicken breasts then reused to cook carrots and potatoes.  Used 2% milk and light butter.  Very delicious!
5.0,I made this potpie today and loved it. I put have of the filling in a freezer bag for the next time I have a taste for chicken potpie. This is a keeper.
5.0,"This is so good, even my husband loved it &amp; he usually does not like chicken dishes.  Love that you can cook 2 pies &amp; freeze one for later, &amp; the reheated frozen pie tastes just as delicious as the freshly made pie."
5.0,We’ve made this recipe at least 4 times and my family loves it! It’s hearty and has incredible flavor. We’ve used all dark meat chicken or a mix of white and dark and both are great. It’s foolproof!
5.0,This was amazing!!! Delicious! Great for a cold winters day. Highly recommend. I used little purple potatoes which gave it a little more color.
5.0,"I’ve never made a chicken pot pie before and I am SO glad I chose this recipe! Yum! I roasted a whole chicken in the morning and diced it up which I will definitely do again for this, such good flavor! I froze one of the pot pies, can’t wait to see how it turns out."
5.0,"Absolutely delicious!   Easy, tasty and filling!"
5.0,"Best chicken pot pie I&#39;ve ever eaten, OMG! I roasted two large chicken breasts beforehand, and steamed whole red potatoes then peeled and diced afterward. I also used a package of frozen peas and carrots. Makes a super-creamy pot pie, enough for 2 pies. Be sure to vent your pies on top, they need to let out steam. Mine cracked on top, but who cares, it was fantastic!!"
5.0,"Made this today and was very pleased. I left out the onions and corn. I diced the carrots and potatoes, used one can of Libby green peas. I used three chicken breasts and two thighs and boiled them , so I had some real chicken broth. For the milk, I used evaporated milk, (one cup milk, 1/2 cup water). I didn&#39;t use a bottom crust. For the top crust, I used a store-bought pie crust, and rolled it out thinner to fit a 9x12 oblong pan. Husband bragged on it without any prodding! I only used half the filling, so I plan to make another to share with someone tomorrow. I really like the fact that it makes two pot pies. Will be making this again!"
5.0,"Been making this for a couple of years. This is the best I’ve eaten. I double the recipe to share with my son’s family. I am so glad I found this recipe.You will want to save this, I promise!"
5.0,"First time making chicken pot pie, this recipe yielded (3)z I used a rotisserie chicken and biscuits on top. It was fantastic. Froze one."
5.0,"Made this for the first time tonight and it was bomb. I made some alterations because my family doesn&#39;t like English peas. Instead, I stirred in leftover fresh spinach for color and it was all kinds of wonderful. Make sure you use both dark meat and white meat!"
5.0,I used unsweetened almond milk to make it dairy free and Bob&#39;s red mill G.F flour  and it turned out great!I also threw in a couple cups of chopped fresh baby spinach.
5.0,"Delicious!  Made this tonight and  did not make any changes.  Will be making again, loved it!"
5.0,"This was the best chicken pot pie I&#39;ve ever made, and is so much better than the store bought ones. It&#39;s classic and perfectly creamy..My boyfriend rates every recipe I try and this one he gave 11/10, and I agree!  I made some minor edjustments - I used the 3 cups of chicken stock to boil the carrots and potatoes, and reserved the liquid to add back in later. I only added 3/4 cup of flour instead of 1 cup. And I added 2 stalks of chopped celery when I added the onion to the pan. I made 1 pie last night,and froze the filling for a future pie. I can truly say I will never buy a store bought chicken pie again."
5.0,"Made it yesterday, very tasty. Excellent recipe"
5.0,"This recipe was exactly what I was looking for,rich thick gravy and delicious. I don&#39;t care for pie crust so I used one puff pastry and cut the recipe in half. Now I wish I had made the whole thing as it was so good. I omitted the corn but added celery everything else I include. I used canned chicken and used the broth from the cans for the gravy. I used a smaller rectangle dish than a 9 x13. it was 8 x 11.5. So good! I froze the leftovers and even took a serving over to my neighbor who lives alone. She liked it too."
5.0,Awesome! Followed the directions to the letter and was very satisfied with the end product.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.
5.0,I add canned diced potatoes to mine so good... everyone that has tried it is obsessed.
5.0,My Mother In Law made this for my husband and I to save for when I had my son.  A quick meal to heat up.   Since then I have made this 4x.  This is a great recipe.  The only thing I changed (based on personal preference) I added 3 cloves of garlic and fresh thyme and rosemary from my Garden. I also only used 1 stick of butter.  Great recipe.  Will continue to make
5.0,"I made this for Thanksgiving dinner for two.  We had already had turkey with the family the week before so we were looking for an alternative meal.  We loved it!  I only needed one pot pie for the two of us and don&#39;t have freezer room for a whole pie, so I put the extra filling in a freezer bag for future use."
5.0,Good recipe.
5.0,"This was the best pot pie that I have ever eaten.  I halved the recipe so that I  made one pie just for my husband and  me. It is one that I will make again and will share with others how good it was.  I moved it to a lower rack the last 5 minutes to make sure the bottom crust was well done. Again one of the best ever!      ( chopped half a large onion. I peeled/diced and boiled  2 potatoes, used 2/3 cup frozen corn and 1/2 cup peas and  3/4 cup canned carrots, drained  the ones that needed to have liquid removed , boiled 2 ck breast and shredded them )  the sauce was half of the regular as given  and had great flavor and thickened  well. Had a little extra filling left over so I made  a very small one with just crust on top.       Yummy.                              ***I see that another reviewer said they made the full recipe and froze half  of the filling for another time, good idea also."
5.0,"Love this recipe. I left out the corn and only used a top crust. Wonderful recipe for a quick dinner since I quite often boil chicken, dice and freeze it and the broth."
5.0,"Great recipe and an easy one. Whenever I have left over roasted chicken I make this dish. I dice the carrots instead of slice, and don&#39;t add the corn. Other  than that follow recipe exactly. Perfect consistency to the sauce."
5.0,"This was the best pot pie I’ve ever made! I halved the recipe, used frozen mixed vegetables. My only change will be to cube the chicken Into bigger pieces next time."
5.0,"Great recipe.  I followed all the directions, but I smoked a whole chicken on my Yoder stick burner smoker.  That added a wonderful smoky savory flavor, especially after putting an herby rib on it.  I’ll definitely do it again!"
5.0,"My neighbor brought this over after I got out of the hospital Tues. night.  I bugged her for the recipe right away. I don&#39;t know what about this recipe that makes it so great, but it is the best pot pie I ever tasted. It must be the thyme, butter and chicken broth. Really fantastic and will be baking it for myself after my hip heals."
5.0,Excellent recipe.  I altered the veggies that I used but followed the rest of the recipe.  The creamy roux in this thing is on point.  So delicious.  I make one pie using the creamy mixture and then freeze the creamy mixture for a future pie.  It&#39;s perfect.  Love it!!!
5.0,This is how mom used to make pot pie. Always great.
5.0,Delicious!!  Even the picky eaters gobbled it down :)
5.0,"Delicious! I added seasoned salt, poppyseeds, a bay leaf and diced celery"
5.0,"I have been making this recipe for years; it has become a family favorite! I usually make little individual pies to freeze with the extra filling. It is my go to, to bring to friends after surgery or tragic loss."
5.0,This was sooo good. Will make it again.
5.0,"Delicious, I will definitely make it again"
5.0,Delicious!  I made a few adjustments.  I substituted whole milk with oat milk.  I used  pearl onions instead of chopped onion. I added onion powder and garlic powder to the seasonings.  I added broccoli when boiling potatoes and carrots. I added mushrooms when adding peas and corn.  I seasoned my chicken when cooking it with same seasoning as I put in this pie. I half baked the bottom pastry before adding filling and top layer of pastry to ensure it wasn&#39;t under cooked. I use a square glass baking dish rubbed with a generous coating of butter.  I would love to try it with Turkey breast!
5.0,"Was craving comfort food, and this was everything I hoped for...  easy to follow instructions.  Was a big hit with my husband."
5.0,"Great recipe. I made some adjustments for our family. I added 1 1/2 teaspoons of garlic powder. I also increased the seasonings to reflect the following: dried thyme to 2 teaspoons, 1 1/2 teaspoons of pepper and 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt. I also swapped the milk for half and half. It was perfect that way for our families tastebuds!"
5.0,"LOVED THIS PIE. I made half a recipe (more or less) in a 10” pie plate with my favorite crust recipe. I didn’t have thyme so I used poultry seasoning, The corn was canned because that’s what I had, and the carrots were leftover roasted. No peas since hubs really can’t stand them, so I threw in some leftover green beans instead. And I used a combination of skim milk and half&amp;half, because again, it’s what I had. Pandemic baking, as another reviewer noted. But it was creamy and delicious, and next time I will make extra and freeze. Yum!"
5.0,Absolutely the BEST chicken pot pie recipe. I made a few minor adjustments based on ingredients I had at home. Throwing out my old recipe. This is the cat’s meow!
5.0,"This is a family favorite! I&#39;ve made it multiple times and it&#39;s a hit every time. It&#39;s easy to make which is my favorite kind of recipe because I really don&#39;t like to cook lol. With ease in mind, I typically use frozen mixed veggies and frozen onions. If I don&#39;t have potatoes at hand I increase the chicken and veggies to make up the volume. I will cook one and freeze the other for another day. Great recipe!!!"
5.0,"Wonderful recipe! We found out that we do not like Thyme, so my daughter uses Rosemary instead. Such a delicious perfect recipe! She also makes her own pie crust which makes it even better! She makes 1/2 the portions because otherwise it&#39;s too much for just 1 pie unless is a bigger deeper pie dish."
5.0,"I actually made this for my son &amp; daughter-in-law, who just had a new baby, so was making some easy meals for them.  I made an extra for us.  It was so quick &amp;  easy to make.  I thought that it was delicious &amp; probably the best chicken pot pie that I&#39;ve ever had.  My husband said, &#34;I don&#39;t know what you did, but... &#34;it was better than any other I&#39;ve ever eaten&#34;.    I will definitely make this again &amp; freeze a few as well."
5.0,"Added red and green bell pepper, and broccoli florets and extra chicken broth to the gravy. Cut the recipe in half and still got two 9 inch pies! Very good and I’m freezing one of the pies for use as another easy dinner"
5.0,"This was so good, its quite time consuming, but well worth it.  This recipe makes way to much for just my husband and I ...so I just made one nine inch pie with my own pie crust, and will freeze the rest of the filling in food saver bags.     I am going to put filling over noodles next time, hope it stands up to the freezer for a couple weeks."
5.0,Deliscous will make again and again.
5.0,"Absolutely delicious comfort food and well worth the time.  I added celery to the onion carrot saute and 2 bay leaves to the cream sauce while it simmered but then removed them.  I used half for a 2 crust pot pie and froze it.  (It cooked up great 3 weeks later.)  The other half of the chicken mix I baked in a 2 qt Pirex baker uncovered st 350° for 35 min while I made homemade waffle batter (reduced the sugar and typical spices, adding a pinch of poultry spice instead.)  My family went wild over the waffles topped with the bubbling and rich hot chicken veggie gravy.  A total hit and kept the pot pie 3 weeks later seeming like a whole new dish.   Winner winner 2 chicken dinners!"
5.0,My go to pot pie recipe.  this is absolutely delicious!!!  I always make this for company and get rave reviews!!!
5.0,Best pot pie recipe I have ever found. Made this last night for Sunday family dinner and everyone raved about it. One pie fed 7 adults and 2 small children! Only changes I made to recipe were omitting the thyme (picky kids) and adding 1/2 cup half and half in with milk. Delicious. Will make this again and again.
5.0,"I have made chicken, and other pot pies, for 30 years. This is, by far, my favorite BASE recipe! I can never make a recipe without some augmentation to make it my own... mishpachah...like family, my Bubbe would say. I omitted the milk. I used a cup of homemade milk free gravy I had left from the meal for which I made the roast chicken we were using (leftovers) for this pie. I recently discovered, if done right, no milk is needed and creaminess survives! I also added an extra cup of chicken broth to compensate for the fluid. In addition I added a Tbs of dried parsley and substituted diced yams for the white potatoes. I made a homemade simple crust (ice water, butter, flour and salt) and brushed the top with yolk/water combo and sprinkled with a few pinches of dries thyme. The cooking time was spot on, even here at high elevation in Colorado. I only wish you could see the photos and taste the creamy, hearty, comforting goodness. I froze the second Pot Pie filling on it&#39;s own to be put in a fresh crust another time. During this pandemic freezer space is at a premium. My new go to Pot Pie recipe. Mazel Tov to Taste of Home!!!"
5.0,"Having never made a chicken pot pie before in my life, I was thrilled with how easy this recipe was to make and how delicious it turned out. We halved the recipe to make just one pie. The nice thing: this was a forgiving recipe. We had slightly less chicken then called for but slightly more potatoes. And didn&#39;t have any onions (because that&#39;s pandemic cooking!) so just used some onion powder for flavor. Really: as long as you fill the pie and have the right amount of the gravy mix, it&#39;s okay to have some variation on the fillings and will still turn out great. Will absolutely make this again and again!"
5.0,"This recipe is a keeper!  I highly recommend this!!! Best I have made and will keep this recipe when making in the future.  I read other reviews and agree the base sauce is excellent!  So easy to make with simple ingredients.  I made the chicken in a slow cooker and cooked with vegetable stock for flavor.  When done, I shredded – taste was great.  I did the potatoes, but left out the corn and peas as I don’t have.  I added celery when cooking the onions for a bit of texture.  Instead of pie crust, I made buttermilk biscuits and put on the top.  Using a small roasting pan allowed to have biscuits for all and it covers the pan nicely.  Try this, you will like it and so will the family!"
5.0,Best chicken pot pie recipe I have found! My family loves it!
5.0,I love this recipe!  I first came upon it 13 years ago when I was making freezer meals in preparation for our second daughter on the way and wanted to have meals ready in the freezer.  I&#39;ve made it over and over ever since! It is the ultimate comfort food and I love that it makes 2 pies.
5.0,"This is a perfect recipe. I was glad it made 2 pies; I was making one for a friend and another to keep. We had ours last night and it was exactly what I hoped it would be! Ultimate comfort food! Our very picky 5 year old loved it. He asked for seconds. I swapped the dried thyme out for 1 tablespoon of fresh thyme because I love using fresh herbs. I boiled my potatoes/carrots in chicken broth, then used the same broth to boil the cubes chicken meat breast and used the same broth for the gravy. I imagine using a rotisserie chicken would make this even easier. I also did a light egg wash on the crust for color. I will be saving this recipe as my new go-to for pot pie!"
5.0,"I make a lot of recipes off the internet and I usually don&#39;t post reviews, but I&#39;m sitting here eating some chicken pot pie and I&#39;m wondering why in the cussword I&#39;ve never made this before! This is absolutely delicious and I think if I didn&#39;t have more self control I&#39;d eat the whole thing right now. Make this pie.  If you don&#39;t like thyme, then reduce. It&#39;s got a lot of thyme. But it&#39;s fantastic."
5.0,This was delicious I added garlic because I love garlic but  it was so wonderful!! The base sauce was so creamy I used low fat milk but was still deliciousness I also added better then chicken bouillon in with the chicken stock step for more flavor ????
5.0,"Delicious! Nice blend of chicken and vegetables. A keeper, for sure!"
5.0,"I love this recipe. I make a vegetarian dairy free version of this pot pie 4-5 times a year.  I sub the dairy for almond milk and vegan butter then use more veggies and vegetable broth instead of chicken.  Always a crowd favourite, even meat eaters and kids!"
5.0,Best potpie I&#39;ve ever had.  Hands down.  Subs I&#39;ve made in the past include using rabbit in place of chicken and subbing cauliflower in for the potatoes.  I&#39;ll be making this one for a long time.
5.0,Halved recipe; added 1/4 tsp. of Bell’s Poultry Seasoning and used Tater Tots instead of pie crust.  It’s in the oven now and it smells really good - we can’t wait to eat it .
5.0,"My husband said this potpie was the best I&#39;ve ever made.  I added celery with the onions, and boiled carrots and potatoes in chicken broth then used the broth to make the sauce. Topped with tater tots, instead of crust."
5.0,The best!!! I make my own crust and that is the only change I make.
5.0,Really satisfied my craving for chicken pot pie and is easy to make.
5.0,"Made this last night, was the best!  Didn&#39;t have thyme so used basil and it was perfect :)"
5.0,"I only used 1/3 cup of flour the second time I made this. It was delicious both times, but we like the filling a bit thinner. It’s definitely a new favorite in our house."
5.0,"This far exceeded my expectations (which were already high because this site has never let me down). It makes so much that I actually made three pies with it. I added basil and mushrooms. Frozen pies are excellent for new parents. I brought one to a couple recently, and it was a huge hit. Definitely file this one away as a keeper."
5.0,This recipe is SUPERIOR to any others I have tried! It has now become a regular home comfort-food for our large family--so delish! We prefer just one crust on the top so I just put the filling into a casserole dish/dishes and top with crust then bake!
5.0,"My entire family loved this- even my picky 4 year old. I did not have corn, which was a bummer, but pie still full of veggies. I used a large pyrex and used pizza dough, rather than pie dough on top only. Delish! Also- I always leave out thyme, as I think it is too strong!"
5.0,Easy and it was the best
5.0,Very moist and tasty!
5.0,I made this banana bread and have had numerous people ask for the recipe.    Everyone agrees that this is the best banana bread they have ever eaten.  I have made several to give at Christmas.
5.0,I am not a chocolate chip fan.....so I added cinnamon chips....we are huge cinnamon fans in this house!!
5.0,"No buttermilk in the fridge so I made my own with milk and vinegar.  I doubled the recipe and left out the nuts.  I used a couple of silicon loaf pans and the edges of the bread were a little dark. I should have maybe knocked the temp down a little to compensate for the dark pan or checked it a little earlier for doneness.  Overall though, the bread turned out very nicely.  I have another 8 bananas on the brink so I&#39;ll make a couple more double batches and work out my flaws. I&#39;ll go get some buttermilk too as I would like to see how that would change the flavor.  I imagine that this will be my go-to banana bread recipe in the future.  thanks!"
5.0,I made muffins!  They&#39;re DELISH!!!  Set the oven to 425 degrees and bake for 16-18 minutes.  The mini-muffins took about 6-7 minutes.
5.0,This is a really good banana bread recipe.  Just a couple things that you need to know.  The bake time at the top says 70 mins and in the recipe itself it says 1 hr 20 mins or until the tooth pick comes out clean.  I have made this 3 times and it takes about 60 mins at the most at 325 degrees.  Let the bread rest in the pan for 5-10 mins thing remove and cool on a cooling rack.  The bottom tends to stick a little when using a spray so use shortening or butter to grease the pan.
5.0,I added chocolate chips and the taste was INCREDIBLE.
5.0,"LOVE THIS!! first bite I took I said, &#34;wow this is the best Banana Bread I have ever eatten!&#34; and then I looked that the recipe and laughed because that was the name!"
5.0,"This recipe is wonderful!  I have made this bread probably 7 or 8 times in the past few months.  My family, visiting relatives, and myself included have given it rave reviews.  Even the time I had the oven temp. too low and it turned out flat as a pancake, they still gobbled it all up!"
5.0,"OMGosh! This is THE best banana bread recipe ever! I made it for Christmas and it was a big hit. My husband and son are diabetics, so I used Splenda instead of sugar and no one knew. I will definitely make this again and again."
5.0,I just discovered this recipe and agree it is the best one I have tried. I added cran-raisins &amp; shredded coconut to my batch. I will try it with whole wheat &amp; splenda nest time.
5.0,"This was even better than my grandmother&#39;s recipe (God rest her soul). It was very moist and I love the buttermilk addition. I used dried buttermilk since I didn&#39;t have fresh. I added the dried buttermilk to the dry ingredients and included the liquid in the eggs, banana, oil and vanilla step."
5.0,"This is much easier than most banana bread recipes because no mixer is needed.  My husband thinks it&#39;s the best I ever made.  I made 2 thinner loaves so it would bake more quickly, and that worked very well."
5.0,"My husband and I agree that it’s the best chicken pie recipe we’ve tried, but I agree with Sfcollins about reducing the flour a bit.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!  ~BW"
5.0,Everyone loves this!! All 4 of my boys and husband devour these pies! We&#39;ve often had guests over and they have always raved about it!
5.0,"Great!!  I add more chicken, a Tbsp of chicken soup base paste and then omit the regular salt."
5.0,Absolutely best chicken pot pie.  Husband not a thyme lover so substituted  sage and summer savory.   Liked thickness of sauce.  I only made 1 pie and saved half of filling for another day.  Will definitely make again.  Maybe even try in individual pies.   Thank you
5.0,My family loves this pot pie recipe. Make it often. Sometimes with frozen crust and sometimes with fresh made pie crust. Always a hit. A definite keeper and thanks for sharing.
5.0,"I love this recipe. I cook it exactly as it reads and it turns out perfect everytime. There is no other pot pie that can compare to this one, and the thyme is crutial for delivering taste. A forever keeper for the whole family to enjoy!"
5.0,We simply love this recipe. I cook it as written and find it is just right! I make 2 pies so we can share with my sister&#39;s family. I have never found it pasty or gummy and have made it numerous times.
5.0,This is the only chicken pot pie recipe I make. The flavors are well-developed and it is pretty easy to make. I generally use a rotisserie chicken for the 4 cups of chicken. I get requests for this pot pie quite often. It&#39;s definitely a favorite in my family.
5.0,I love this recipe! I use this recipe at home and at my job.
5.0,"To be brutally honest, this is very close to the Chicken Pot Pie recipe found in the older versions of Betty Crocker cookbooks, which is the best recipe I&#39;ve ever tasted. While homemade crust is better in my opinion, it&#39;s also far more time consuming. This is a quick and easy recipe and the filling is right on the money. If, somehow, you come out with a bland meal after using a full cup of butter, you&#39;re doing something wrong."
5.0,"I am a young senior and a well seasoned cook and baker - pun intended! I know there will be some who will start clucking under their breaths when I say I haven&#39;t made this exact recipe, but is is very close to one my mother, who was a fabulous cook, taught me years ago. I read a lot of the reviews, because there are so many, and I want to make comments based on what I read and my level of experience.  Because there are so many who commented on there being too much thyme in this recipe I would suggest that if you do not use thyme regularly that you add the amount suggested in increments. If you&#39;re not use to more heavily spiced foods start off with a quarter of a teaspoon - then sample it. Not enough, add another quarter of a teaspoon and sample it again. If you like that amount you don&#39;t need to add the full teaspoon. Flavours become more pronounced as they cook and have time to combine with other ingredients. Spicing is a very personal thing and so you should always try a bit if you are concerned there is too much of anything. You will not get zapped by lightening if you adjust the seasonings to your own personal preferences. AND - it does not mean the recipe is not great. The person who submitted the recipe likes the seasoning - based on her family&#39;s taste buds but it doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be adjusted to your own! The same goes for any other recipe. Have some teaspoons ready to sample recipes as you go. Personalize to your heart&#39;s content! It really irritates me when people comment about throwing food out because they don&#39;t know how to make it more palatable. I do have to remind myself though that not everyone had a mother like mine or had Home Economics classes in high school - though they didn&#39;t teach me much I hadn&#39;t learned at home. Cooking and baking can be so much fun and life is too short to get so caught up on minor issues. Remember - add a pinch or so, sample and add more till it is to your taste. Baking has to be a more precise exercise because there has to be an exact ratio of rising agent (as an example) to other dry ingredients and liquids used. Again, flavouring is a very personal matter. I would like to thank Karen Johnson for submitting this recipe that makes this potpie from scratch, with no condensed soup and artificial flavours! To quote from a book called Siddhartha by Herman Hesse, I read in my early 20&#39;s &#34;Knowledge is communicable, wisdom is not.&#34; One of my Mom&#39;s favourites: &#34; We get too soon old and too late smart!&#34;"
5.0,"Thank you, Regi M, for your review. So glad you took the time to give such helpful information AND share the knowledge that you have acquired from your experience."
5.0,This recipe is probably one of the best pot pie recipes I’ve eaten!  Very filling!
5.0,"Awesome  flavor and relatively easy to make. I added 2 stalks of celery and omitted the boiling of the carrots and potatoes as I had diced them fairly small. When I make again I will boil the carrots and celery as they were still a little crunchy, but red potatoes were perfect as is. As a personal preference the gravy made with the flour was a bit too thick and I think I would cut the flour in half next time to make it a little easier to fill in the gaps for the pie."
5.0,"Best ever pot pie!! We added garlic to the onions and rosemary and parley to the spices.  Moisture and texture were a concern, but it was perfect. We all loved it!"
5.0,"Making this for the second time tonight, i use king Arthur flours chicken pot pie crust recipe along with this recipe and the results are simply fantastic, substituted onion salt,  heavy cream and celery and mushrooms no potatoes, also used 4 bouillon cubes, just awesome."
5.0,"Excellent as written! I love that this contains no canned soups(though I do use them for convenience sometimes). I used rotisserie chicken for this. Love the tip about the slumped crust! I learned something new. Lynne, Volunteer Field Editor"
5.0,"this was really good. The only thing I did different was instead of adding the carrots, I used frozen peas and carrots. Next time I might try adding mushrooms (though it&#39;s good without them too). I&#39;ll make it again for sure"
5.0,"Such a wonderfully comforting and delicious filling!  I used my own butter-based pie crust recipe, and made the filling as per the directions. Great comfort food!  My husband said it was the best chicken pot pie he’s ever had.??"
5.0,It&#39;s perfect. There&#39;s no a thing I&#39;d change.
5.0,Absolutely amazing! I made crust from scratch because I didn&#39;t have store bought on hand and I&#39;m excited to see how much easier it is with a rotisserie chicken and packaged pie crust! My son is allergic to dairy so I used Earth Balance &#34;buttery&#34; spread sticks instead of butter and unsweetened original Plant Milk instead of whole milk and the whole family chowed down like it was their last meal on earth.
5.0,"I freeze the filling, and pull out two ready made pie crusts right before baking (one deep dish and one regular).  YUM!"
5.0,"I freeze the filling, and pull out two ready made pie crusts right before baking (one deep dish and one regular).  YUM!"
5.0,This pot pie is amazing! I tried the recipe without the thyme and added some onion salt and seasoning salt and it was absolutely delicious!
5.0,I really liked this pot pie!! It was delicious.  And it made 2 pies so I got to freeze one and have it the next week.  Perfect if you are making dinner for another family who needs the help.
5.0,I&#39;ve used this recipe several times.  I love it!   I use it for turkey pot pies too and adjust the herbs.  It is an excellent way to use up roast turkey and freeze pies for later.
5.0,"I have been making this recipe for several years and it&#39;s a favorite for everyone I&#39;ve fed it to. My kids in particular love it.  To save prep time I use 16 oz frozen diced potatoes and 16 oz frozen mixed veggies. I also decreases the thyme to 1/2 tsp.  I do end up making 3 pies using these amounts. Lately my kids have decided they don&#39;t like the crust as much so I only put crust on the top.  It&#39;s definitely time consuming to make, but having 2 spare in the freezer makes it worth it. Plus I love it so much!! The reheat from frozen instructions are spot on. If you haven&#39;t tried this, you are missing out!"
5.0,This is such a versatile and great recipe.  I double recipe and freeze extra in pans without crust.  Put Crust In A Pan Add Filling And Bake!
5.0,I followed the recipe but left out the potatoes (dint want to over starch or whatever) and no chicken as i dont eat it. Added steak seasoning and onion salt. i used frozen veggies. I used pork shoulder that i made a few days earlier. IT WAS DELICIOUS! Now if i had known pot pies were this easy. I feel so silly buying them.  My store bought pie crust wasn&#39;t any good so i had to improvise with pizza dough. YUMMM.
5.0,This is the BEST Chicken Potpie I have ever tasted.  This is a keeper!!!  Thank you for the recipe.
5.0,"So my fiance and I are both pretty indifferent to chicken pot pie, but I found myself browsing recipes in order to use some extra chicken I had before it went bad. I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. Upon eating one bite, he says, &#34;this has to go into the rotation!&#34;. We both then devoured the tastiest chicken pot pie ever created. I did do a few things differently. I seared 5 chicken breast strips in vegetable oil  that I coated in garlic powder, salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. I  was out of thyme and thought the italian seasoning might add the missing flavor to the dish. I used one whole can of drained carrotts, and half the amount of the rest of the items the recipe called for. After adding the cubed chicken I cooked prior, the recipe was still enough for 2 pies. I did not have 4 pie crusts so I used my largest round corningware casserole dish in place of a pie pan, which provided room for the entire mixture. It worked perfectly! This is definitely in the rotation from now on!"
5.0,YUMMY!You do not need to look for another pot pie recipe.This is it!
5.0,This is  the quintessential pot pie.  The flavors are spot on.  This was exactly what I was looking for.  Thank you.
5.0,Best pot pie recipe I&#39;ve ever found!  We don&#39;t care for thyme so left that out and still wonderful!
5.0,Very delicious! I have already shared with two other friends.
5.0,I have made this bread for years.  I found the recipe in Taste of Home magazine several years ago.  I bring the banana bread to all family gathering.  The little ones just love it.  Most are from out of state so I make extra so they can take home.  It is the best ever recipe for making banana bread.
5.0,"I&#39;ve made this 3 times in a week...after reading some of the other reviews, I cut oil to 1/4 c and used 1/4 applesauce. I also cut sugar back to 1 cup and never missed the 1/2 cup of sugar! Today&#39;s loaf came out delicious!"
5.0,Reminds me of Grandma&#39;s Banana Nut Bread.  Very moist and flavorful and makes the WHOLE house smell wonderful during baking - Freezes well also... DEFINATELY a KEEPER!!!!
5.0,So good!
5.0,"The very best Banana Bread.  When I make it now I reduce the amount of sugar, and instead of all white flour I substitute 1 cup white flour with 1 cup whole wheat flour and it is even better with less calories."
5.0,"This IS the best-ever banana bread. The only change I make is to subtract 1 t of buttermilk and add 1 t banana extract in its place, to get a little extra banana flavor. Everyone loves this banana bread."
5.0,"Nice texture, really moist and really tasty!I used a little less sugar as well and it wasjust wonderful.  Will make again-"
5.0,Will never use another Banana Bread recipe again! A family favorite!!!
5.0,I made this recipe without the walnuts and baked it in my doughnut pan.I drizzled glazed on the doughnuts - they were stellar!
5.0,"This is a keeper recipe. All my family enjoyed it. I doubled the recipe and made two loaves, somehow missed the timer and thought I overbaked it. but the bread was still moist and delicous."
5.0,"This really is the best banana bread I&#39;ve ever made. I added a teaspoon of baking spice (cinnamon, cloves, ginger, nutmeg). I won&#39;t ever use another banana bread recipe again!"
5.0,"Loved it so much.  I don&#39;t love putting pies together, so instead I rolled out my pie dough and cut into 3&#34; squares which I baked individually.  We ladled the &#34;stew&#34; into bowls and topped with a piece of pie crust."
5.0,"I have made this several times and it&#39;s a favorite hands down!  I put all the filling in one large pan instead of 2 pie plates.  Made my own crust for a 2 crust pie and put it on top, no bottom crust.  We don&#39;t like thyme much so subbed out the thyme and subbed in poultry seasoning.  Delicious!"
5.0,Made this and it&#39;s totally awesome.  Tried freezing it and the sauce turned to water so it doesn&#39;t freeze well.  But this is my new favorite.  The second time I made it I put in half the amount of potatoes and more chicken.
5.0,"This is a fantastic recipe!   I make it just as written except I sub fat-free half and half for milk.  Because of my family&#39;s taste preferences, I sometimes omit potatoes and use frozen carrot/pea mix instead of fresh carrots.  I often add frozen green beans as well.  I use unsalted chicken stock to reduce sodium.  These taste perfectly fresh after several months in the freezer.  I wrap them in plastic wrap, then put in a gallon ziplock to freeze.  Def. one of my top new recipes I&#39;ve added this year.  The only problem is that it&#39;s so good, we eat too much :)!"
5.0,Great recipe.  I didn&#39;t change anything except for I did make only one pie by using half of each ingredient.
5.0,"Made this tonight, absolutely delicious! I usually make a recipe I got from the pioneer woman, it’s similar and good, but this is really really good. I did mine as instructed but instead of making 2 Round pie plate pot pies, I made one in my 9x13 stoneware dish. And I only added 1 pie crust. I have an 18 year old and my husband, and they’re big eaters! So this way to serve, for us worked great!I highly recommend this recipe! You won’t be disappointed! It’s a keeper! Enjoy!"
5.0,"Made this on a cold, winter&#39;s night and it was a big hit! The pan was wiped clean. So needless to say, it&#39;s going in my recipe box!"
5.0,"This is a good, solid recipe.   I&#39;ve been wanting to make a pot pie for years; my grandma used to make them, but i dont have her recipe, so just beginning to experiment.   It was 10 degrees and snowing, so today was the day.I had to make it dairy-free, so substituted the butter with bacon fat, and just used a bit more broth, and the liquid from the corn (i used canned, not frozen), to replace the milk; total abot 4.5 cups liquid.   Next time I think i will try oat milk in place of the dairy milk; all we had in the fridge was almond milk, and I didn&#39;t think that would work well.I also cooked down some portobello &#39;shrooms  (about two cups before cooking) in the pan first, and added a cup or so of chopped celery along with the onions.   I pretty much followed all the other measurements.  Oh, added a bit of ground clove, too.It was really great.  My two boys &amp; wife loved it; it was gone in minutes.  I made just one pie  (only had one box of crusts) in an extra deep 10&#34; stoneware pie pan, and still have enough filling left over for probably another small pie.  But tomorrow is another snow day, and I suspect the kids will warm it up and have it for breakfast.  That&#39;s how they roll."
5.0,"Made this tonight, I love it . I did follow the recipe but have a deep dish pie plate and made just one. Hanging onto this one for sure."
5.0,"Made this tonight, it was awesome.  My husband loved it.  Been making a pot pie for years that has cheese in it but this one takes the prize.  Cut recipe in half and only made one tonight, anxious to make again and try freezing one."
5.0,This is so delicious! There are a lot of steps but it is worth it!!
5.0,This is a fantastic pot pie recipe!  I was really impressed with how well the frozen one baked up when I was ready to use it.
5.0,It was delicious! We added 1tbsp of Worcestershire sauce and 1 tbsp of garlic powder.
5.0,"I don&#39;t usually do the cooking/ baking (as my husband is a much better cook). He asked for chicken pot pie today, I searched for recipes, and thought this one looked good.  It was great- directions easy to follow, good flavor, (omitted the thyme and fresh carrot, used frozen veggies instead); he said it was the best meal I&#39;ve ever made!. We both had seconds, and will see how second pie that we froze turns out in a week or two! Highly recommend this recipe!"
5.0,"I&#39;ve prepared this several times and made some changes to it, &#34;kicking it up a notch&#34; as Ina would say. First, I use only fresh veggies (except for the peas and pearl onions). It adds time but fresh carrots, parsnips, and Yukon Golds make a difference. Next, I add fresh mushrooms to the onion saute. To keep this flavorful I roast chicken breasts that have been very well seasoned. (Much better than rotisserie chicken and you can add the chicken juices to the stock, upping the flavor considerably.)  I also add a glug of sherry (or white wine, whichever is handy) to the simmering sauce.  Finally, I use the TOF site&#39;s buttery, flaky pie crust as the topper. It doesn&#39;t take long to make (and I only let it sit in the fridge for about 30 minutes) and is delicious on this pie. Yes, I&#39;ve increased the work and time but if you do, this is likely the best pot pie that&#39;s going to come out of your kitchen."
5.0,So good! Really easy to prepare!!
5.0,"This is a great recipe. Easy to make and tastes really, really good! I made no changes this time. The next time it is made, I will cut down on the thyme. It’s a bit too overpowering for me. Other than that.... spot on and delicious!"
5.0,"Yumm..!!!!  I made it exactly per the recipe minus the frozen corn (because I didn&#39;t have any).  But I&#39;m not sure it needed it.  I may cut down on the thyme a bit next time, and I did use low sodium chicken broth.  My husband says it&#39;s 10 Stars.. he says it&#39;s the best meal I&#39;ve cooked!"
5.0,"First, this is called Baked Chicken Pie not pot pie - pot pie has no crust.  My grandparents (born in 1904) were PA Dutch so I know this to be true.  It is amazing how many things you can do with this recipe even using sea food.  For the baked chicken pie, my grandmother always added a few hard boiled eggs, diced.  Made the gravy silky and adds a extra punch.  She also made gravy on the side in the event someone wanted their&#39;s extra moist.  You cannot make and freeze these if you use hard boiled eggs.  I make multiple small ones in the aluminum pans and freeze them.  They are great to pull out and heat when it&#39;s snowing outside!!"
5.0,"This was soooo good!  Made exactly to recipe, easy and the whole family loved it!  The grandkids had seconds even!  Definitely a keeper!"
5.0,Made this today (half recipe) and loved it.  I used a cup of the frozen hash browns instead of fresh potatoes and that worked fine.   This is a keeper!
5.0,"Very, VERY good! I have never really liked other chicken pot pie&#39;s that I have had in the past. But my husband and daughter LOVE them, and they&#39;ve been asking me to make it forever. When I saw the video for this recipe it looked easy enough and I had all the ingredients already. (I didn&#39;t realize this was a double recipe though!) since it made enough for two pot pies I gave one away and they really enjoyed it to. The only thing I will change next time is so skip the corn and add two cups of green peas just because I think it looks prettier with more green in it."
5.0,"Excellent.  So often we all make a small tweak in the recipe, but I made this just as the directions stated.  Ok, I made one tiny change and used closer to 2 1/2 cups of potatoes rather than 2 cups, but those cubed potatoes were just sitting there on my cutting board.Very, very good.  Even my &#39;food particular&#39; mother loved it and was willing to take home leftovers :-)."
5.0,"Scrumptious!  I have been searching for a Chicken Pot Pie recipe and this one is a keeper! I didn&#39;t have any thyme so I substituted with poultry seasoning, using only half the amount required, perfect."
5.0,"I have tried many pot pie recipes and this is hands down the best. I clicked on some of the other reviews that were 1/2 stars because I couldn&#39;t imagine why no one would like this. My best guess if you think it is too flour-y or too much thyme, then maybe try again because honestly I make these for anyone who is sick, birthdays, neighbors....and they rave constantly.  Maybe a misstep in the recipe was done.  The directions are correct and I like that they have the  frozen bake time! It is listed separate for easy understanding!  I love being able to have a frozen option such as this instead of soup/chili all the time."
5.0,just finished making this and it&#39;s one of the best Chicken Pot Pies I&#39;ve ever eaten. Followed the recipe exactly and it&#39;s amazing.Most recipes online don&#39;t turn out so great but this one did.I&#39;d let it sit a little longer than 15 min to set a little better but will be making this again and again.
5.0,"I made this recipe a couple weeks ago, but didn&#39;t buy the second pie crust. I froze the remaining mixture, and after getting a second crust, my other pie is now in the oven, and I can hardly wait to eat it! This is a very tasty recipe, and I plan on making it in the future! Thank you!"
5.0,Excellent recipe. I like to make a double batch and freeze the filling. Then I can make pies later when I&#39;m having a busy week. This one is a keeper.
5.0,Great pot pie! I used frozen mixed veggies and southern style hashbrowns to cut down on some of the prep.
5.0,Awesome recipe!!My husband and son loves chicken pot pie and I typically buy them fresh from a warehouse club.  Been wanting to make a pot pie from scratch and found this recipe.  Made it last night and hands down it was the best pot pie they have ever had. I even ate it and I don&#39;t like  pot pie!!Planning on making it agin and will swap out chicken with beef stew meat and beef broth.
5.0,"I love all the fresh ingredients! My kids love this, it&#39;s  a good way to get some vegetables in them. The seasonings are perfect. I don&#39;t change a thing!"
5.0,"Excellent, time consuming but so with it!"
5.0,"This is the best chicken pot pie I have ever eaten! I don&#39;t usually write reviews, but I had to join TOH just to let everyone know that this recipe is amazing. I followed the recipe exactly as written and everything is just delicious; I wouldn&#39;t change a thing. The seasonings are just right, and it has become a staple in my house. My picky eaters love this, and my husband said that this is his favorite meal! Thank you for sharing such a delicious recipe!"
5.0,"Wonderful Recipe, I served it for a ministry appreciation dinner.  All the guests loved it as did my very finicky son in-law.  I did alter it  just a little by adding 2 Bay Leaves (removed before placing in casserole/ pie pan(s))  and 1 1/2 tsp Poultry Seasoning. I did this primarily because I was using rotisserie chicken and wanted to make sure I had full bodied flavor. This recipe is a keeper!"
5.0,"The chicken filling is the absolute best I have tried and will definitely make again.  As a personal preference though, the only thing I would change is to only use crust on the top, or top it off with puff pastry."
5.0,"Made this today and my house smells so good.  Gave one pot pie to my parents, my dad just called to say how good it was.  Waiting to put ours in the oven when hubby leaves work.  The filling is really good and was simple to make.   My only change was I used green beans instead of peas (my dad hates peas) and used top crust only.  Will absolutely make this again."
5.0,"Great recipe!  The buttermilk is what caught my eye, adds a great moistness.  Have made it several times, but make it into muffins.  Freeze them in packs of two, great to take to work for breakfast or mid-morning snack!  Hint--freeze &#34;too ripe&#34; bananas in their skins in a zipper freezer bag. Take out one or two for a recipe, thaw for a few seconds in the microwave, pinch off the stem end and squeeze the banana right out of the skin!!"

5.0,"I have to agree. This is the best banana bread ever. I add honey and maple syrup instead of sugar. It is so good. My husband never liked banana bread because he said it  was always dry, but not this one!"
5.0,"This recipe looks awesome, and judging from the reviews, I think I wanna try it. We usually add chocolate chips and walnuts to our batches, so I hope it turns out!!"
5.0,Very tasty recipe.  We warmed up slices and had it for breakfast.  Very good with coffee or milk.
5.0,I get asked to make this all of the time.  I usually make muffins with it.
5.0,Can&#39;t make enough of these. My six grandkids love them. I always make three at once.
5.0,This is the BEST banana bread recipe ive tried. My fiance never liked banana bread but him and my son eat it all up in a day! They both always ask for it!
5.0,"Great banana bread, moist and easy to make.  As suggested, I reduced the sugar by 1/2 c. and the loaf was plenty sweet enough.  Didn&#39;t have walnuts on hand so used pecans.  Found it tasted even better the day after baking.  A keeper recipe!"
5.0,"Love this recipe, it&#39;s the best I ever had.I&#39;ve made it around 10 times and shared the recipe with many!"
5.0,"5 Stars!!!I used 1/4 cup of melted butter and 1/4 cup canola oil. I always use melted butter in some form in my baked goods.I also only used one cup of sugar.A little baker&#39;s secret if you don&#39;t have ripe bananas on hand, use jars of banana baby food. I done this many times and no one can tell the difference. In fact guests always comment on how moist the bread is.I always have jars on hand."
5.0,The best banana bread recipe I&#39;ve made.  It is excellent the way it is but I added another banana and it made it even more moist.
5.0,It was very good.. Just a little to sweet. I even added an extra banana but the sweetness took over it. I will however make again bur reduce sugar...
5.0,Awesome.
5.0,This one is a KEEPER!  I&#39;ve tried a lot of different recipes (almost each time I try a new one) - I think this one is the best yet.  I followed what others have said and added less salt/pepper/thyme.  (But love the thyme in it!)  I doubled this recipe (I had just pulled apart 2 rotisserie chickens and had a lot of meat) and I could have made 3 decent size deep dish pot pies from that amount had I enough pie crust.  As it was I ended up with 2 deep dish (probably over filled) pies -- with one going to the freezer.  And I still some filling left over that I can make probably 3 mini pies from once I make more pie crust.
5.0,I always use my own pastry but the filling was spot on.  This was a typical roux so am uncertain why many thought it was too much flour?  As with any roux you must cook long enough with liquid to make it a somewhat thick but creamy white sauce before adding the other ingredients so maybe that is the case.  Will definitely keep this in the &#34;wheelhouse&#34; of recipes!!
5.0,"I made this recipe for the first time, it&#39;s by far the best pot pie recipe I&#39;ve ever had/made. I ended up with enough filling for 3 pies based on the recipe, but I&#39;m not complaining. It turned out perfect by following the recipe, not sure why other reviews indicate needing to use less flour or seasonings."
5.0,"It was absolutely delicious! My family of 7 devoured this! I did make my own crust. My husband and son said if I was to change anything, the only thing they would want was more chicken. I followed the recipe perfectly and I thought the seasonings were perfect as well as the amount of flour. (and I am not a meat fan, so I thought the amount of chicken was perfect)"
5.0,"Made this the first time as written. I felt it was too salty and the thyme flavor was overwhelming. The second time I used sodium reduced broth, eliminated the salt, and cut the pepper and thyme to a 1/2 tsp. It came out perfect. It is definitely a keeper."
5.0,"This is an excellent recipe. I did add three hard boiled eggs. I reduced the tymeand salt as suggested, and it was fabulous. I do recommend doubling the sauce through. It was too dry."
5.0,"In a word...FABULOUS!! Followed the recipe as is except halved for the two of us and, due to personal preference, left out the corn but put in extra carrots and potatoes."
5.0,This is the best chicken pot pie recipe I have ever made.  It is delicious and freezes well.
5.0,"I&#39;ve been making this recipe for the past year, it&#39;s absolutely delicious.  I usually freeze one of the two, which I love.  It&#39;s great knowing you have a meal ready in the freezer if needed.  This meal is perfect for the colder seasons.  I also appreciate that it&#39;s a recipe that you can throw in whatever veggies you have on hand.  I love celery, so I&#39;ll saute celery with the onions and if I have green beans or anything else, I can make additions or adjustments with the veggie amounts."
5.0,I have made this often and it is a great dish. My father-in-law loves it and is always asking when I will be making again because he would love another one soon!
5.0,Chill the filling completely to keep the crust from being doughy.
5.0,"Cut the recipe in half as only two of us. Excellent as is. I only added a bit of fresh ground nutmeg to the roux, just because I always add nutmeg to a roux. Not sure with the thyme I really needed it in this one. Also, needed bit more broth than stated or sauce gets to dry. Great dish! Update: On the warm up with leftovers did get very dry, if left overs next time will add a can of cream chicken soup, or make more roux. Still delicious even dry!"
5.0,"I&#39;ve been making this Chicken Potpie for a few years now and can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve never reviewed it.  I only make half because there&#39;s just the two of us, but this is the only pot pie I ever make because it&#39;s easy, doesn&#39;t use canned soup, and taste excellent!  If you don&#39;t have exactly what&#39;s in the recipe, you can substitute anything your heart desires and it&#39;s always good.  Thanks, Karen Johnson, for making me look like a great cook!"
5.0,"I always make these ahead and freeze them when I&#39;m using up leftover chicken or turkey.I have one little trick I use, I buy two pre-made pie crusts and only one package of therefrigerated rolled out pie crust.  I can freeze the pies, ready-to-bake without having to do so in my pie plates.I fill the ready made crusts with the filling, then brush the edges with egg wash, top with pie crust sheets and press firmly with fork to adhere together.This makes the perfect, &#39;no clean up&#39; dinner for busy days, especially during the holidays."
5.0,Absolutely delicious and easy to make.  Hearty meal that sticks to your ribs!
5.0,This recipe is great.  I made one pie then froze the rest to use in a new pie crust later.
5.0,I&#39;ve made this recipe numerous times and it always comes out great! I cut the recipe in half and use half of the required flour amount because we like our gravy thinner. I add two tablespoons of white wine to the broth/milk mixture. I also only use one crust on top (no crust on the bottom). This recipe is a keeper!
5.0,"Absolutely FANTASTIC!  This is the best recipe for Chicken Potpie and much rather use the amount of butter in this recipe than canned cream soups, which most potpie recipes use.  I halved the recipe &amp; followed the recipe exactly.  However, right before putting it in the oven I brushed the top crust with egg wash.  Karen, THANK YOU so much for sharing your recipe with us all."
5.0,"Love the previous reviewers idea of using the frozen pie crusts on the bottom and one package of the refrigerated crusts for the top. You are freeing up your pie plates from being in the freezer and if you take one to someone else, they don&#39;t have to return the plate! So good!"
5.0,Absolutely love this
5.0,"This was awesome!! And, to have one for the freezer too is such a bonus. The thyme is the key ingredient that makes it unique &amp; yummy."
5.0,Very good pie plus it makes two of them
5.0,Hands down THE best Chicken Pot Pie recipe out there!!!
5.0,Love this recipe.  I have made it three times and my family have commented how good it tastes. It is nice to use whatever you have on hand.  One family member can&#39;t have corn so I just added mushrooms and celery.  Love you can freeze one for later.  It is in my recipe box as a keeper.
5.0,This recipe is fantastic and simple. I cut it in half and only added some extra seasonings to the original recipe. It turned out wonderful.  My husband had his plate clean before I was halfway through.  It&#39;s a keeper!
5.0,"This was wonderful. Prepared as written, except I used homemade pie crust instead of store bought. It received rave reviews!  Thank you for sharing!"
5.0,We liked this very much.  I made this recipe as stated.  I followed the directions after freezing a pie and it took longer to bake then stated in recipe. Just be prepared for a longer bake time!!!
5.0,Can I make this with beef instead of chicken? And use beef broth for chicken??
5.0,"I made this tonight, it tastes great! The consistency is perfect. I used almond coconut milk instead of regular milk and 3/4 cup butter instead of the full cup. I would agree with the other reviews to use less thyme as I did not, it is just a tad bit much if you use the whole teaspoon! I plan on freezing the other half of the filling to use at a later date with biscuits :-) Good luck!!"
5.0,"This is the best, like others I use my own pastry recipe. I have made it like stated which is great but I like it the best made with left over gravy and 1/4 to 1/2 cup of cream and less salt. My family love it.  I make two, cook them both, eat one freeze one or give it away to friends or family. Thxs Karen Johnson"
5.0,Jeanettenfrench  i substitute beef and beef broth all the time i use broth instead of milk also.i love this recipe have used it for a long time now.
5.0,"I&#39;ve made this pie on a couple of times and every time it gets rave reviews, even from the kids.  I also like that I can freeze one or give it away.   Great recipe and delicious!"
5.0,"This recipe is very easy and forgiving, and lends itself well to substitutions . I find the amount of filling is more than you need, so I make little puff pastry pockets whith what is left  over and it is a big hit. I agree with other reviewers about the thyme and the butter, I use about half as much of both with a good result. I am no fan of store bought pastry, so I used the Betty Crocker two crust pie recipe which is deliciously flaky if somewhat tricky to roll, but if you put the dough between two pieces of parchment paper is comes out perfect."
5.0,OMG it was fabulous - I used sweet potatoes instead-just great
5.0,"I am not normally a huge fan of chicken pot pie; however I had lots of Thanksgiving leftovers to use, so I thought I would try one. Well, boy and I glad I did! I am now a believer! This is the BEST chicken (or turkey!) pot pie I have ever eaten! Even my husband raved! I did leave out the corn, and probably lowered the amount of thyme (my shaker bottle wouldn&#39;t let me take the lid off, so I just poured a couple of shakes worth in the sauce). This recipe halves well, as I wasn&#39;t about to make 2 pot pies (see first comment about not liking pot pie). I will definitely make the full recipe next time and freeze one! Thanks for the amazing recipe!!"
5.0,Very yummy! I halved and made one pie with home made crust and vegetarian chicken.
5.0,This is a GREAT recipe- the first chicken pot pie that my family really likes and requests.  I have made it three times and it turns out perfect every time and warms up nicely the next day.
5.0,"DELICIOUS, EASY, ALSO FREEZES WELL"
5.0,This is a very good chicken potpie but be aware that it makes alot !- I was unable to fit it into 2 9 inch pie pans and used two larger deep dish rectangular dishes.  I really like the flavor of the filling and the fact that nothing canned was used- all vegetables either fresh or frozen.
5.0,Excellent! Thank you so much for this yummy recipe! Changes I made: I only used 1/2 cup of butter. I added fresh asparagus I large diced and roasted the asparagus and the carrots together. Also added celery and saut?ed that with the onion.   One can of corn instead of frozen. Used 4 cups of broth instead of 3. I used half &amp; Half instead of milk. Also used Whole Wheat flour as I was out of white flour. Very pleased we could not taste the difference in the flour and will use it again when making this.My husband said Marie Callender&#39;s (a chain famous for their pies and pot pies) should use this recipe!  Thanks again!
5.0,Excellent recipe and easy to make. I cut the recipe in half and make one pot pie.
5.0,"This is a family favorite!  It is versatile and is a good basic recipe which allows for changing up the vegetables or even meats used.  The sauce/gravy is delicious and not too heavy - easy to prepare so no need to use canned soups.  It is true comfort food and we enjoy it year around!  I would like to say that the second pie makes it to the freezer, but it often doesn&#39;t!"
5.0,This is a five star pie.
5.0,Very yummy!  My SIL wanted chicken pot pie and this was a complete hit!
5.0,Great recipe and so easy!! The first time I made it I cut the recipe in half and made one pie. The second time I made it I cut the recipe in half  and made three small 51/2 inch individual pies. The next time I will make the full recipe and make individual pies and freeze some. I followed the recipe exactly except I added a little extra broth to make it more creamy. I absolutely love this recipe! This is my go-to Chicken Pot Pie Recipe!! Thank you for sharing!
5.0,Nice recipe with lots of flavor. The filling is thick enough that it does not run out in the pan when you cut it. Definitely a keeper!
5.0,<p>Very good. I mixed in a little cheese as well and next time I&#39;ll add chopped cooked bacon. Keeper recipe for sure!</p>
5.0,"This. Is. Amazing. I make my own crusts and throw in whatever I have for ingredients and seasoning. But I love the white sauce combo of butter, flour, milk and broth. This recipe is so versitle! I&#39;ve made it 4 times so far and never used the same veggies/meat/spices. And it always turns out great! Makes one to eat and one to freeze. Ps. My 2 year old loves this! This last time I used: salt, pepper, garlic powder, and Mrs dash garlic for seasonings (about a tsp each), chicken for meat, carrots, sweet potatoes, and a bag of frozen mushroms, broccoli and beans."
5.0,This is a Five Star recipe!  It is Super! Everyone ate this down and then ate seconds!  I&#39;ve made this often since it is now requested all the time.  I make both pies with my own pie pastry recipe with great results.  Even served this to my guests who all were very impressed : )
5.0,"I have made this chicken pot pie recipe several times, and it is a HUGE hit in my household!  Thick, creamy sauce and the thyme gives it just the perfect taste!  On occasion,  I have used Bisquick to make the crust, giving it more of a doughboy type of topping.  Whether you choose to make the filling and doughboys for a chicken stew, or follow the crust directions for a pot pie, both are absolutely delicious!"
5.0,Yummy I use asparagus and use large cupcake pans for mini pies
5.0,"have not made this pie yet, but wanted to ask if anyone has made this with a top crust only. Thanks, Sukie"
5.0,This recipe is delicious!  A keeper for sure.  I used a rotissiserie chicken..and pilsbury pie crust..makes it fast and easy.  The only thing i changed was i used Italian seasoning instead of thyme.
5.0,"This recipe is fantastic! I made this as written, but for one pie.   I used the breast meat from a Costco chicken and a bag of mixed vegetables to make it easier.  I am going to make the filling again tomorrow and will toss it into the freezer for busy days."
5.0,This was a super recipe.  Very tasty.  Even my picky 5 yr old wanted more.I just have to work on perfecting my pie crust!
5.0,"This is great! I made my own crust and it was much better. I also used our leftover turkey from thanksgiving, which is now becoming a tradition that the whole family loves. Much better than turkey sandwiches every day for a week.I cut back on the butter (by half) and used sour cream in lieu of milk as we never seem to have milk in our house. It turned out great! It&#39;s hard to find a recipe that produces a thicker pie (versus a thin one). I will always use this recipe from now on!"
5.0,This is a fantastic recipe.  It is one of my go-to recipes when making a meal for a friend..  I can make one and have an extra to take to someone or leave in the freezer for a busy night.
5.0,I made this last night and my family absolutely loved it it was the first time my kids ever had chicken pot pie I used mix vegetables instead of the carrots and peas separate and added celery salt I made 2 pies and it was all gone in 35 min great recipe after that my wife wants me to cook every night
5.0,"Sounds so good but I am going to try boiling the vegs  in some of the chicken broth, using the broth as directed after Draining . It should give it a better flavor"
5.0,"Made this last night.  Everybody loved it!  I added another 1 tsp of salt because what was called for in the recipe just wasn&#39;t enough ( this took the flavor from just ok to yummy), and I was out of peas so I used cut green beans.  Prep time took me a little longer than I expected but was worth it in the end because I get two pies out of the deal.  I also ran short on crust (I had already used one crust for a pumpkin pie, so I only had 3 and needed 4), so instead of fully covering both pies, I just used cookie cutters on the 3rd crust and covered most of the surface of both pies with snowmen and gingerbread men shapes; kids loved it.  Filling comes out firm so it doesn&#39;t spill all over.  Also, even though boxed crust says to cook at 450, I did what the recipe said and did 425 for 35 mins (in gas oven) and it was perfect.  This will be my go- to chicken pot pie recipe!"
5.0,A win with my family.... my husband was tasting before it went in the oven and said it can be eaten just like that....thanks for sharing this recipe.
5.0,"Wow this was phenomenal!  I actually ran out of all-purpose flour for the first time in my life!  I had to work with whole wheat flour.  I made my own crust-highly recommend- and the filling was just perfect.  My husband said this was Amazing!  My go-to recipe was the All-American Turkey Pot pie on TOH, but this one wins!  However, I will continue to make the crust from the turkey recipe-its to die for!"
5.0,"This recipe was fantastic! It took me one hour including the pastry dough( I used chef Ramsey quick puff pastry recipe) . My adjustments were ...I  used baby potatoes with skin ,1 can of corn,  1 cup of peas,  and 1 cup of vanilla almond milk. I used an extra 1/2 cup of chicken broth to compensate for the thickness of the almond milk.I did not use thyme or carrots because they are flavors my family does not enjoy!Bon Appetite!"
5.0,This recipe was absolutely wonderful.  I rolled my own crust so it took me a little longer.  My whole family loved it.  Even my very picky soon-to-be-10yr old liked it and asked for more.
5.0,"OMG. What. A. Recipe. To-die-for delicious! I want to add a photo of my pie, but there appears to be no manner in which to do so."
5.0,This pie had rave reviews from my family--everyone loved it! My only change was that the sauce got a little too thick so I added more chicken stock. Came out perfect!
5.0,"Great recipe. I agree with the comments that a homemade crust would be even better. I used Pilsbury refrigerator pastry crust and it turned out pretty good. Very easy to pull together and the best part, knowing there is another pie in the freezer!"
5.0,"I know this may seem crazy to ask, but when it says poor the potatoe mixture in, is it talking about the water you cook the potatoes in??"
5.0,"This was wonderful...perfect combination of ingredients and very flavorful.  It does take a while to put together, but a lot can be done ahead, e.g. cook and freeze individual bags of chicken to have on hand.  To save time, I just bought packaged veggies (2) and added the chicken and potato.  My husband loved it!"
5.0,"You will never make another chicken pot pie after making this one! It is well worth the effort! If using frozen pie shells (like the tenderflake), I find I can get three pies out of this recipe! I also add chopped parsnips with the carrots and then cut down on the frozen veggies. The richness of the sauce is just incredible! Even my one year old eats an entire piece!!"
5.0,"Good chicken pie!!  I wasn&#39;t sure I had frozen peas and didn&#39;t want to dig through the deep freeze to see if I could find any, so I substituted frozen chopped broccoli so there would be some green in it.  I was going to make my own pie crust, but decided not to bother because I had some biscuit mix, so I mixed some up and dropped biscuits over the top of the casserole.  I cut down on the thyme, added maybe an eight of a teaspoon since I don&#39;t like things too heavily seasoned. Also, I halved everything as I just wanted one pie.  Delish!!  Will make again, and next time will probably make a pie crust from scratch when I&#39;m not as rushed for time. Another thing....I don&#39;t think it needs a bottom crust, just one over the top."
5.0,Every one enjoyed. Found recipe very easy. Also liked they told you wine to serve.
5.0,My boys loved this. I omitted the milk in the filling because there seemed to be plenty of liquid already.
5.0,"I absolutely loved this! i made it for my family and although it took a while, it was worth it! I used a rotisserie chicken from Albertsons and just used the chicken breasts. Instead of canned or fresh chicken stock i used Chicken Bouillon.  I also used a bottom and top biscuit crust . (Biscuit Crust Recipe:   http://www.food.com/recipe/chicken-pot-pie-with-biscuit-crust-26846)  To keep the crust from getting soggy i baked the bottom crust for about 15 minutes before adding the filling. It only needed to bake for 30-35 minutes."
5.0,"This was great! Actually made it twice in one week. First time I only made 1/2 the recipe because it is only me and my younger son. It was gone by the next morning.  Today I made the full recipe, I am working all weekend and wanted something here for him easy to heat up. The ONLY variations I made were using 1 tsp of pepper instead of 3/4 and fresh thyme instead of dried.  Try it!"
5.0,"This is the best chicken potpie, my kids would never eat potpie , now they ask for it."
5.0,Really good! Def. the best pot pie I have ever had. I am a vegetarian so I swapped out the chicken for mushrooms and the chicken broth for vegetable broth. Amazing! Thank you. Great end of work week/Friday night comfort food meal.
5.0,flavor was perfection .
5.0,This is a really good recipe. My husband absolutely loved it and so did my boys. You have got to try it.
5.0,This is an extremely delicious recipe !!!  My  husband ate an entire pie to himself in one day for breakfast lunch and dinner ! I am currently going to the market now to gather the ingredients to make more!  A major hit in my household!
5.0,I made this last night and my family was wowed! It is hearty and tasty and for my large family  we are always having to double recipes. This one made plenty for dinner and for lunch leftovers.  It totally hits the spot when you are looking for a fall comfort food recipe..
5.0,I loved this recipe!  Only made one Chicken potpie and saved the rest to serve over mashed potatoes.   Very tasty!
5.0,Love this recipe. Get so many compliments when i make it.
5.0,"This was  delicious!  Everyone had seconds. The only downside was my largest frying pan, which is quite large, was not big enough.  I would suggest using a Dutch oven instead."
5.0,"I&#39;ve made this three times now and my family still raves about how much they love it!!  Full of flavor, drives me crazy waiting for it bake!  I highly recommend this recipe!  The leftovers reheat just as tasty!!!  Wonderful cold weather comfort food!"
5.0,"This is the pot pie recipe I always use because it is so rich and satisfying.  I use half the butter and flour, and add a few more herbs and some white pepper.  I love that the recipe makes two pies! I make one for us, and one to bless another family."
5.0,This is still a 5 star. Having it for Christmas Dinner this year per family request.
5.0,"This was super good and easy - this was the first recipe I&#39;ve used to make a chicken pot pie and it&#39;s a keeper. However, the second time I made this, I used only one crust and made more of the broth/gravy mixture - I froze this one to cook later. I followed the how to cook the frozen pie instructions but my pie was still cold after it should&#39;ve been ready - it took an additional 45 minutes and I increased the oven temperature. It was still tasty - just disappointed it took a long time too cook through."
5.0,"Made it for dinner tonight, delicious! My family loved."
5.0,"fantastic!  So good, don&#39;t get to freeze the second pie."
5.0,This was delicious and satisfying!  I used my own crust recipie so I could make one large pie instead of two. Total hit and my family loved it! Great comfort food!
5.0,Really filling. I added some dill and parsley flakes for some more flavor.  And I added some poultry seasoning to the broth for a little chicken flavor boost. Baked pie came out wonderful.  Second pie into the freezer. Hope to enjoy that next month!
5.0,My husband told me this recipe was a keeper and i can&#39;t take the leftovers to work. I am really glad I picked this recipe to try. We loved it!!!
5.0,"This recipe was perfection! My husband could not say enough good things about it! He said &#34;Now this is what a chicken pot pie should taste like!&#34; I followed the recipe exactly. I did use Yukon Gold potatoes instead of a regular baking potato. At first, I thought I would cut the recipe in half as I didn&#39;t think I needed two pies worth, but I am so glad I went ahead and made both. The chopping is a bit time consuming, so I am glad that now I will get two meals out of this one night of work. I put the other pie in the freezer for the future and cannot wait to have it for a simple meal a few weeks from now. Loved this!"
5.0,Fantastic!  My whole family loved the flavor.  Definitely a keeper.
5.0,"This was delicious, and I turned it vegan. Substituted soy milk and soy butter, faux chicken strips, but essentially the same. I did put a little more pepper and salt in to counteract the sweetness of the soy milk. In any case, it was a huge hit b"
5.0,Have been making this recipe for Christmas presents for at least 7 years along with others everyone loves this also make all through the year can never make enough.I make it in mini loaves this year about 50 loaves.
5.0,This recipe was great. I reduced sugar to 1 cup and it was plenty sweet enough.
5.0,"I&#39;m not fond of banana bread but this recipe is delicious!  The bread was tender - neither too light nor too dense.  Just perfect.  I did make a few changes:  1/4 butter, melted + 1/4 cup vegetable oil (in place of the 1/2 cup canola oil) and used 1-1/4 cups sugar + 1/4 cup brown sugar, packed (in place of 1-1/2 cups sugar).  The brown sugar gave it a nice darker color and a chewier crust- which I like.  I used Jumbo eggs and Vanilla Bean Paste.  Before I put it in the oven, I sprinkled chopped walnuts and clear sugar crystals on top of the batter.  When it was done it looked beautiful and had a nice sweet crunch on top.  I will definitely be making this again.  Would make great muffins!"
5.0,"This banana bread is SOOO good!!! It&#39;s so moist and it tastes wonderful! I would definitely recommend anyone to make this, and this will be my regular recipe for banana bread!"
5.0,The best banana bread I have ever tasted!!
5.0,"I made this and brought it to a family reunion, and my sister couldn&#39;t stop eating it!<a href=""http:"">youtube downloader</a>"
5.0,Kids loved it. The only thing I would do differently is bake it for less time. We baked it 1  hour and 10 minutes and it was still a little too brown.
5.0,"This is by far, the best banana bread I have had. It&#39;s easy to make and I usually make a lot and freeze the loaves. I haven&#39;t altered the recipe but like a few of the changes that some have suggested (applesauce for oil and brown sugar). Thanks - I will try this."
5.0,"My wife found this recipe in TOH several years ago.  The name is right, it really is the BEST EVER!  Depends on your oven on how long it needs to bake."
5.0,"This is the first time I have ever written a review on anything, but when I saw this recipe come up for the &#34;Taste Of Home Recipe of the Day&#34;, I knew I had to write this. This IS the best banana bread recipe! Since I have found this one, it is the ONLY one I use. And I don&#39;t change a thing in the ingredients. It has the perfect texture, sweetness and its moist and when I make the two loaves this recipe makes, they&#39;re gone in two days. This is the recipe I give to my daughter and anyone else looking for a delicious banana bread recipe."
5.0,I am surprised to see this.  Years ago I revised a recipe and it is identical to this one except I use 1 cup of sugar.  When I was working and we had pot luck lunches I was always asked to make my Banana Bread.  I have given this recipe out many times.  It is the best.
5.0,"This is the exact recip I have used for over 40 years.  I thought I was the only person who had this, as it was given to me by a lady who passed away about 35 years ago.I have always had a lot of compliments on this.  I have been requested to make it many times for group gatherings.  It makes happy to know that so many others also have the recipe.  I know the recipe so well that I do not even have to look at the recipe when baking it.  I will definitely continue to use this recipe, so yes, I would mmake it again.Thanks,Submitted By:  Kathy Boltin"
5.0,"I have been making banana bread for years, but this is amazing. I always freeze my old bananas so I always have bananas for bread. I also sometimes throw in some blueberries or cut up apples.  Amazing...."
5.0,"This is the same recipe I have used for years with one exception. I use butter instead of oil. I think it gives a better flavor and texture. I sometimes use 1/2 c sour cream in place of the buttermilk, because I almost always have sour cream, but sometimes don&#39;t have buttermilk. Both result in excellent flavor."
5.0,"Been using this receipe for years I agree with the others this is the best receipe I have ever used for Banana Bread.  Dee, NJ"
5.0,"This was so yummy!!  I actually made it in to mini pot pies using a muffin tin.  They were perfect size for my kids, who really liked it.  I just halved the recipe and used a 4 inch round cutter for the bottom and a 3 inch round for the top and cut it out of the store-bought pie crust.  I also brushed the tops with an egg wash."
5.0,"This recipe is AMAZING.  My family can&#39;t eat any other pie after making this.  I can typically get three pies out of this recipe, but only because we like a little less filling.  This is by far my most requested recipe!!"
5.0,"Super easy and made it Sunday for the week. Added a bit of garlic power to the mix and baled the chicken in packets with olive oil, salt and pepper along with a bit of chopped garlic...yum! Loving it now!"
5.0,"This is a delicious pot pie recipe, my husband absolutely adored it.  I frequently halve the recipe to feed just my family but when there is a new mom or a friend under the weather this is the perfect meal to take to them and still have dinner for your family as well.  You can never go wrong with classic comfort food."
5.0,This recipe is delicious!!!!  My husband LOVES it and so do I!  I like that it makes 2 potpies.  I usually make one and freeze the other for another night!
5.0,"We had this for dinner tonight. We loved it. I added fresh garlic with the onion. Next time, I plan on adding chopped celery. Delicious."
5.0,"Excellent flavor, the gravy would be good on other dishes as well.  I only used a top crust."
5.0,This was so good &amp; easy to make!  I only used 1 pie crust per pie &amp; left out the thyme.  It&#39;s nice to know I have one pie in my freezer for a busy night.
5.0,"This was a huge hit with my family (even my husband who has never been a fan of chicken potpie)!  It took some time to prep, but it was well worth the effort.  I love freezer cooking so having a pie for the freezer was a definite plus! I used deep dish pie crusts and this made 2 very full pies.  Delicious!"
5.0,"This was a huge hit with my family (even my husband who has never been a fan of chicken potpie)!  It took some time to prep, but it was well worth the effort.

5.0,"This was so good!  I wasn&#39;t sure how the leftovers would be, but they were just as good as the first day it was cooked."
5.0,"Really, really good.  Used 1/2 cup ea of butter &amp; flour as recommended.  Did not have frozen corn so substituted sauted mushrooms &amp; celery and did not use a bottom crust.  Poured a portion of it (kept remainder for another day) into an 8-1/2 x 9 dish, covered w/ one rolled out sheet of puff pastry, sprinkled w/ minced fresh parsley &amp; paprika, baked @ 375 for 70 min.  6 servings - our guests went back for seconds!  Great w/ double cheese bread &amp; spinach salad.  A keeper!"
5.0,This was crazy easy to make!! I found though that it filled THREE regular pie shells. Probably two deep dish ones. Reheats beautifully and the seasoning is perfect!!
5.0,I cut up the chicken in cubes and sauteed it in some olive oil and sprinkled a little Adobo on it. Once I added the broth to the recipe I also added about a teaspoon full of chicken base to the sauce (Better Than Bouillon). Also I did have to add a little bit extra broth to help thin the filling out a little bit.  My family and friends loved this!!!
5.0,"This was so good. I can&#39;t wait to make the second one thats in the freezer. I would put less thyme in it, if any. But I will be making this again."
5.0,"We also had enough filling for a third pie.  We found that the crust browned before the bottom crust was done cooking, but we rather enjoyed the creaminess it added.  If we make it again we would likely cut the thyme in half and add a second seasoning.  It was just a lot of the same flavor."
5.0,"This turned out so good! I did a few things different though...I used 3/4 cup flour, and I bought a premade rotisserie chicken from the store and used that. Also, instead of using a crust, I baked it for 45 minutes then top it with unrolled cresent rolls and baked until the cresent rolls were golden. Mmmm so good! Will def make again"
5.0,"I made this on 1-3-13 and it was delicious. I cut the recipe in half and only made one pie, as I was unsure if it would turn out &amp; it tasted great!"
5.0,First time I ever made a Chicken Potpie. It was excellent. My husband and kids enjoyed it and want me to make it all the time.  Thank you for sharing.
5.0,"This was my first time making a homemade pot pie. It turned out great! I halved the recipe and made one deep dish pie and had no leftover filling. The only change I will make is to use a little bit more chicken broth for the gravy, mine ended up just a little too thick (even before the boiling/thickening stage)."
5.0,I have been making this recipe for years. Definitely one of my favorites. Love having one in the freezer for later.
5.0,"This was great, except I felt it called for a bit too much thyme so I will make it with less next time. But otherwise it was delicious."
5.0,"Also, I added a bit extra pepper and salt while mixing before putting everything in the pies. It was to dull down the overpowering thyme, which did help prior to baking. It was strong after, obviously."
5.0,Best Chicken Pot Pie!!  Very creamy and hearty.  Recipe was easy to follow.  Freezes very well!!  Have made with chicken and also with leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.  Will make this again and again!!
5.0,"This was great!  The first pie was wonderful, and we had the other one last night.... cooked that one for an hour at 425 with no temp change and it came out fine!"
5.0,Phenomenal!  Halved the ingredients to make one deep pie as well.  I didn&#39;t use as much flour either because I noticed the filling to be too thick so I used extra broth to compensate.  This was delicious:)
5.0,This is really yummy comfort food.  I&#39;ve made it twice now &amp; my 4 kids love it.  I usually make my own pie crust but I used the store bought to save time and couldn&#39;t believe how good this was (and easy).
5.0,My husband and I made this receipt this past weekend.  Chicken Potpie is one of my favorite comfort foods and this recipe is the best I&#39;ve ever had.  Will definitely be adding it to my recipe box.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!
5.0,"It was great!  Turned out to be a little more work than I thought, but was well worth it!"
5.0,A real crowd pleaser.  This is the best chicken pot pie recipe.  I add extra peas because the everyone likes them.
5.0,The Best Chicken Potpie Ever!!  The first time we prepared this it was great.  The second time and after we knew what we were doing...it was the best!!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!
5.0,This recipe should have WAY more ratings!   A little time consuming to make but SO worth it!  The frozen pie turns out great as well!
5.0,"This is the BEST!  I did cut back the butter by 1/2 a stick.  I usually double this and make two 9 x 13 pans using homemade pie crust.  I also just use frozen carrots and skip the potatoes due to a family allergy, but it does speed the process up a little bit :)"
5.0,Very tasty! My friends loved it!
5.0,"Seriously, only use half the butter it calls for (1/2 cup instead of 1 cup) it is still plenty rich and creamy.  It was great."
5.0,"This has been a family favorite since I first made it when I received this issue of Quick Cooking.  We have 6 children, so both pies would go in a single meal when all the kids were home!  Now I can usually freeze one for later--unless some of my sons find out I&#39;m making this &amp; decide to come home for supper that night!  I substitute 2 cups of frozen corn for the peas as my husband hates most vegetables.  I&#39;ve also made it with only the potatoes &amp; onions.  And, I use 1 tsp. of poultry seasoning instead of thyme because I don&#39;t like the flavor of thyme.  My youngest daughter made it on her own for her 13th birthday because I only had the use of one arm at that time--I talked her through it &amp; she was very proud of the compliments she received!"
5.0,Yup. That was the best darn chicken pie I&#39;ve ever eaten. And one to share - even better!

5.0,Yup. That was the best darn chicken pie I&#39;ve ever eaten. And one to share - even better!
5.0,MMMM.. best chicken potpie! Gravy is delicious. Great for company!!
5.0,This is the best potpie recipe. I share this one alot.
5.0,"I tested several pot pie recipes before settling on &#34;the best&#34; for my recipe box --- and here it is!  It&#39;s my go-to recipe for taking to new moms or shut-ins, because the double recipe allows me to make dinner for my family and theirs."
5.0,"Great tasting and easy to make.  I only wanted to make 1 pie, so I halfed the recipe and it worked out great."
5.0,"My family loved this recipe. I think my 17 yr old had 4 helpings, and my husband, who usually doesn&#39;t like this, had 2 helpings. I will definitely make it again."
5.0,I make this potpie all of the time.  It is our favorite meal.  It is DELICIOUS!  I make it for people who are ill or have had a baby and it&#39;s perfect because there is one for them and one for my family.  Every single time I make it I get a request for the recipe.  I saute the chicken in good spices and chop for the best flavor.
5.0,This is very good.  I plan to make it again for our Church Potluck.  Thank you Karen Johnson.
5.0,"I made this pie for my family and they loved it.  I froze the other half and then made it for a work potluck and everyone wanted the recipe.  I did change it a bit, instead of peas I put in frozen broccolli and made it with a homemade crust instead of store bought.  Absoultely a keeper recipe."
5.0,a very yummy comfort food
5.0,"I poached the chicken in broth &amp; water with lots of poultry seasoning.  I also added 1 tsp. of thyme, poultry seasoning &amp; salt to the mix.  It was absolutely fabulous!"
5.0,Very easy to make and it is super delicious!  My whole family enjoys it and I enjoy them eating vegetables without arguing.
5.0,So delicious! My family loves this and it&#39;s so easy to make.
5.0,This is the best pot pie. Ever. I plan on using leftover turkey in it after Thanksgiving.
5.0,"I made this for the first time at the weekend, and It really exceeded my expectations. I was amazed at how easy and ridiculously tasty this was. I made my own pastry from scratch and can&#39;t wait to make this again!!! Thanks for sharing!"
5.0,<p>Amazing flavor and easy to make.  2 thumbs up from everyone. </p>
5.0,"Anyone tried baking the chicken in the oven? Whenever I try to fry on a skillet pan, my chicken is always raw in the middle. Thanks"
5.0,This is my favorite potpie recipe. It&#39;s great to make when I need some homemade comfort food.
5.0,This turned out GREAT!  I used less expensive ground beef instead of the more expensive chicken.  I also made my own pie crust with my favorite recipe.  The frozen pie tasted like it had never been frozen.  I don&#39;t need to look for another pot pie recipe! THIS IS IT!
5.0,"This is the best recipe!  My freezer cooking group uses this every time we get together.  We have also adapted it to using beef stew meat.  To make things really easy we buy deep dish pie crusts and top with Pillsbury refrigerated rolled pie crusts.  Packed into a 1 gallon freezer bag and labeled with instructions, they are so nice for giving to families in need as well as my own home!"
5.0,"by far the best homemade potpie I have ever made. We really, really loved it!"
5.0,This is a wonderful pot pie.  My husband and son loved it; there was none left from the one pie.
5.0,"I adapted the recipe and skipped the potatoes and carrots.  I in turn used 4 cups of frozen mixed vegetables to make this truly a quick fix.  My family loves it so much, that the 2nd pie doesn&#39;t make it to the freezer any more!!"
5.0,"My husband and son both loved it!  I used a Pillsbury crust and a left-over store bought bbq chicken.  My husband grew up on homemade potpies and his Mom is the best pastry maker I know, so I was ready for an &#34;It&#39;s okay&#34; but got a &#34;Wow, this is really good.  One of the best I&#39;ve ever had&#34;.  He even went as far to say that he was a little hesitant when I said that I was making a chicken potpie (don&#39;t know where that came from as I&#39;m a good cook!)  Another plus is that it made two good sized pies."
5.0,"I absolutely love this recipe and so does my husband.  I double the amount of Thyme and black pepper.  If I&#39;m short on time I will use 2 15 oz cans of mixed veggies in place of the potatoes, carrots, corn and peas.  I also like to use fat free half-and-half if I have it on hand."
5.0,Forgot to add that I used only 1/2 cup of butter (by accident) and it turned out just as good.
5.0,"I tested other potpie recipes, trying to find the perfect one.... this is by far the best, and the one that made it&#39;s way into my permanent recipe collection.  This is one of my favorite dishes to take to new moms or shut-ins, because it&#39;s a double recipe -- one for my family, and one for theirs.  It&#39;s delicious!"
5.0,Made this last night.  My family told me this one is a keeper.  I bought 2 9 inch deep dish pie crust and I had enough filling to make 3 pot pies and gave one to my neighbor.  I will definitely make this one again!
5.0,"I&#39;m rating this as a 5 even though I haven&#39;t tasted it yet. Right before summer I made one of these..put in all in a very deep dish pie shell, but it got hot and my husband didn&#39;t want me to heat up the house, so I gave it to my son and dtr in law and told them to bake it. They told me it was the best pot pie they had ever had and it was gone within 24 hrs. It&#39;s just the two of them!!! Gonna make one for me and hubby this week and freeze the other one as recommended."
5.0,Doubled the recipe and got 5 pies out of it!! Cooking for a very large harvest crew and it was a hit! They all loved it.  To save time I used canned chicken.  Great recipe!  Love that it makes lots.  I will use this recipe long after harvest.  Its great to have extra in the freezer for those days when you dont feel like cooking!!
5.0,"I left the lemon juice and paprika out when I marinated, and I marinated the chicken overnight.  I did not use peppers, because we are allergic to them.  I did the rest of the recipe as written.  It was very delicious and tasted just like the fajitas you get at a restaurant.  I served it with Mexican rice and refried beans.  I will be making this recipe again."
5.0,MDe this recipe tonight with the bean and corn salad to Rave reviews. This will definitely be part of the dinner rotation. Thanks for sharing.
5.0,"Excellent recipe, have made it many times with chicken, but this time I used shrimp &amp; scallops and it was amazing!! Served it with Cilantro Lime Rice &amp; homemade salsa...delish!"
5.0,"Super delicious! Just wondering: 
When you write 1-1/2 teaspoons. Is that 1.5 teaspoons?"
5.0,All of my family loved this recipe!  Will definitely make again.
5.0,Delicious why eat fajitas out when their so easy and cheap to make at home!
5.0,"FANTASTIC!! Ever since I discovered this recipe in my Taste of Home magazine, I&#39;ve made it at least once a month. I serve it over copycat Chipotle cilantro lime rice. I double the marinade, and don&#39;t throw it away so there&#39;s a bit of sauce for the rice. Seriously one of the best things I&#39;ve ever eaten!! Everyone I&#39;ve served it to loves it!! Quick, delicious meal for impressing dinner guests. Quick, delicious meal for impressing your family!"
5.0,I have made this dish soooo many times over the past couple of years. It always turns out so great. Personally I put the marinade in the skillet with the chicken. Probably the best chicken recipe I&#39;ve ever made and it&#39;s pretty easy!
5.0,So easy and so good. My first time to make this and I will definitely make it again.
5.0,"These were amazing!!!  I made them for my teenage son and his friends.  They didn&#39;t even sit down, just stood around the table eating!  The chicken is wonderful on salads as well.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, though I doubled the marinade to make extra chicken.  I also ended up marinating the chicken for 3 days.  It tasted great!"
5.0,"everyone really loved this - i marinated chicken breasts for a few hours in this (i forgot to add the lemon juice and used regular kosher salt because thats what i had on hand), then i cooked the chicken on the grill. i didn&#39;t marinate the peppers but will next time. also will try it with shrimp and will do the chicken peppers and onions on one sheet pan all together if i&#39;m not grilling"
5.0,"This recipe is a KEEPER.  I have made it with chicken, steak, and shrimp.  For the steak I added cilantro to the marinade.  It always tastes super fresh.  If you are a camper, this is a great and easy recipe bc you can marinade the chicken slices while they are in your cooler, and if you cut up more onions and peppers, you can make kebabs for a 2nd dinner and save money and cooler space.  I honestly love this recipe.  Its a go to."
5.0,So delicious!   The whole family agreed- this is our favorite homemade recipe!
5.0,"I got this recipe in your 2004 Best Holiday  Recipes magazine. It is wonderful. I make it exactly by your recipe with the exception of the bake time, I bake it 1 hr 10 min. I have taken it to church many times and I get rave reviews. It&#39;s a keeper. . . ."
5.0,"This is &#34;Best Ever Banana Bread&#34;.  As others, the only thing I changed was that I reduced the sugar to one cup.  one and one half cups was actually too sweet, and less sugar is better!  Occasionally I will substitute half the white flour for wheat and it turns out just fine!"
5.0,"This is very similar to the recipe I got from my mom when I left home in 1974. As someone else stated, mine calls for butter rather than oil. If you don&#39;t use &#34;ripe&#34; bananas it won&#39;t turn out as well. The riper the better.  Absolutely the Very Best Ever!!! I make a dozen loaves at Christmas every year and give them to friends who say they can&#39;t wait for the holidays to roll around for another."
5.0,I have a little hint for this recipe. This recipe is similar to mt mothers but if you mash the bskking soda in with the bananas the bananas foam and make the finish product no as dense.
5.0,"These are the changes I used half all purpose flour and half whole wheat pastry flour, 5 tbsp Splenda Baking Blend and 3 tbsp Splenda Brown Sugar Blend, 1 egg, 2 egg whiites and 2 tbsp liquid egg substitute, 6 tbsp oil and 2 tbsp butter, 3 bananas, added 1 tsp cinnamon and used pecans instead of walnuts (my husband is allergic to them) and toasted the nuts first.  My husband said it was the best banana bread I had ever made in 56 years of marriage.  I made 3 recipes and baked it in 8 mini loaf pans for 40 minutes at 325 convection.  Healthy &amp; delicious!!!"
5.0,"Will try this recipe as is.  Don&#39;t know how you can rate a recipe with five stars when you change the ingredients in the recipe.  As for oven-time, we all are familiar with our own ovens and baking times"
5.0,"@chocolate desert and marian08:Many of us have allergies, diabetes or other medical issues and food likes or dislikes in our families. For us, it&#39;s very helpful if someone shares the way they adapted a recipe. I sometimes look at a recipe that I think would be good but has ingredients I can&#39;t use for one or more of the reasons above. I don&#39;t always feel brave enough to try and make the changes myself since I don&#39;t always know what and how much to put in to replace things.When more experienced cooks try out the changes I need and share them, I am in their debt. There are many recipes I could never have tried without their help. While you may be recipe purists, please try to understand the limitations some of us live with when we are trying to expand out repertoire. It&#39;s pretty boring to eat the same things over and over because they are the only &#34;safe&#34; recipes you have."
5.0,"This is an excellent recipe the results were great.  I have to agree with marian08, make the recipe as printed, than rate it.  When changes are to suit an individual taste, it is NOT rating the written recipe."
5.0,"I just happened to have some over-ripe bananas on my counter when this came to my inbox today. :) Lucky me!  I made this for my daughters (and I), and we were all humming &#34;MMMMMMM&#34; in unison as we sampled the still warm loaf. I would certainly make this again.  I will also try a version as suggested by VirginaCA, and I appreciate her input very much.  My hb is diabetic, and her version won&#39;t spike his sugar nearly as much as this one.  Thank you for submitting your suggestions!"
5.0,"I make this all the time I do subsitute oil for butter, and I sometimes put in mini chocolate chips...Yummy!!! The best bread ever."
5.0,I had this recipe from an old friend of mine 20 years ago and have been making it since then. Best ever!!
5.0,This is the best banana bread.  I make it all the time minus the walnuts.  Delicious!
5.0,Best ever banana bread with a few changes; 1 cup granulated  sugar and 1/4 c brown sugar and i cup of sour cream insted buttermilk
5.0,"I added some cinnimon, allspice, &amp; nutmeg and increased the bananas to 3. Excellent!"
5.0,Made this this morning.  It smelled wonderful.  Use Crisco to grease bottom and half way up sides of pan.  Once cool wrap in plastic wrap and let sit for several hours.  Moist but not real dense.  I&#39;ll make again!
5.0,Nice texture; you can substitute all purpose flour with Pilsbury Banana Nut Quick bread.
5.0,"This recipe is fabulous! I give it 5 stars and I didn&#39;t change a thing, followed it exactly. My husband exclaimed, &#34;these are really flavorful!&#34; And he didn&#39;t even know that was the recipe title! So, these fajitas are aptly named and absolutely delicious.  I ate one the next day for breakfast, that&#39;s how good! ;)"
5.0,Absolutely KILLER!  was a huge hit with the family.  I let it marinate overnight and cooked in a grill pan (on the stove).  Will definitely make this again.
5.0,This is so delicious and so easy.  Definitely will make every week!  Thank you for making my life better with this easy and fun to make recipe!!  It’s totally awesome!  Will never buy fajita seasoning again!
5.0,These are really good and easy to make.  I need to make it more often.  Even my husband who is tolerant at best of chicken breast said they were &#39;good&#39;.
5.0,I normally don’t leave reviews but this recipe was so good everyone ate it! My kids are picky but their plates were wiped clean and my husband doesn’t really care for chicken breast but said who ever created this recipe is genius!! Very good!
5.0,"We love Mexican meals and this is a very easy and tasty recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and served with cheddar cheese, salsa, sour cream, and guacamole. We had this meal last week and my 8 year old grandson couldn&#39;t get enough. He likes being able to add only the toppings he wants. One family member skipped the tortilla and saved herself some carbs. In the future, I will also offer black beans or refried beans and rice. Yummy!"
5.0,"I love Mexican style meals better than my wife but she gave these five stars also. I complimented these with refried beans (recipe compliments of Ree Drummond), arroz rojo aka red rice (recipe compliments of Marcela Valladolid) and quacamole. For the two of us this was to much to eat for one meal but it was excellent the next day. Two tips: the refried beans freeze well for use at a later date, if you have plenty of left over quacamole smooth it out on top and gently add a thin layer of water, the next day pour the water off and you have quacamole that didn&#39;t turn brown."
5.0,"Delicious fajitas! We loved them, thank you for posting!"
5.0,"Have been making this almost weekly for years. I prep the veggies and chicken on Sunday, and then just need to cook it Monday night after work. Makes great leftovers for lunch the next day."
5.0,Good go to recipe.... I sometimes use cubes of Salmon fillet instead of chickenand just follow the recipe ...It really works
5.0,Excellent recipe! Simple and delicious!!
5.0,"My family loved this recipe for our chicken fajita night! Unfortunately, I didn’t have any Chile powder so missed that extra heat, but still so tasty! Thought it might be a little too salty, but it was just right. I tend to be conservative with my use of spices due to my husband’s preferences, but he enjoyed this too! Thanks ??"
5.0,I&#39;ve made this recipe twice since the August issue of TOH came out. WONDERFUL. I always order Fajitas when at Mexican restaurants because I can&#39;t have rice and beans. NEVER thought I could make these at home! This recipe is a keeper. VFE
5.0,"My across-the-street neighbor and her niece made these fajitas for dinner 2 nights ago and were kind enough to invite me to have some with them!  They followed the recipe EXACTLY and, I must say, I would not change a thing.  The level of heat was perfect for me .... the chicken was tender and flavorful and the peppers just the right amount of &#34;crunch&#34;.  They reminded me of the chicken fajitas I used to get at Planet Hollywood when I visited Atlantic City, NJ.  If you haven&#39;t tried this recipe...... I suggest you try it.  It will become your new &#34;go to&#34;  fajita recipe.  Perhaps make them with shrimp instead of chicken next time!!"
5.0,I love this chicken fajitas and i&#39;ll definately try this chicken fajitas recipe this weekend. The best thing about this recipe is that it takes very less time in making this recipe. Even i have a special chicken fajitas stuffed pepper recipe as well. Check  out the recipe here: https://www.recipespack.com/chicken-fajita-stuffed-peppers-recipe/
5.0,"I cheat like hell out of sheer laziness and cut the prep time in half, and this is still a hit with the whole family.  Rather than slicing and cooking chicken, peppers, and onions, I use Trader Joe’s 12oz grilled chicken strips from the refrigerated section and a bag of their frozen Fire Roasted Peppers &amp; Onions.  I just cut the chicken strips into smaller strips to make them fit better in the tortilla and marinate them exactly as in the recipe.  When the chicken is done marinating, I just heat up the peppers n onions for about 10 minutes and then dump in the chicken to get it warm and it’s done and delicious.  I also use Trader Joe’s whole wheat low-carb tortillas that work and taste great in this recipe while saving some calories.  Doing it this way, total prep and cook time is about 20 minutes, but if you don’t tell anyone they’ll think you actually worked hard making it.  I love cheating."
5.0,Delicious and so easy! May need to add to our weekly rotation.
5.0,Very flavorful and would definitely make again.  We prefer less chili spice (we prefer a milder taste) so I cut the chili powder in half (1/4 tsp) and left out the optional red pepper.  It was perfect!
5.0,"Excellent! I made it last week, chicken and beef, and even the leftovers were tasty. We’re having it again tonight. This will be on the menu several times a month. I’m going to make up a big supply of the spices, to save time."
5.0,Tried this as a change from our old style of fajitas.  We happened to have all the ingredients on the shelf at home.  Really great taste and fairly easy to make.  Definitely will be having this dish again soon!
5.0,"What I love about this recipe is that you probably have everything in your pantry.  We make this at least once a week.  I live with 2 20 something guys and they LOVE fajita bar night.  I cook the chicken first and then the veggies after so it picks up all that good chicken flavor.  I serve it &#39;bar&#39; style, I cut up tomatoes, avocado, lettuce, shredded cheese, guac, salsa, sour cream, etc and let everyone build their own fajita.    This marinade is also excellent with shrimp.    It is so good I have started putting all of the spices into baggies, and then when I want to make the fajitas I just have to add the oil and lemon juice and go.  10/10 highly recommend"
5.0,A family favorite!
5.0,"Love this recipe, been using it for years.  More recently, in an attempt to increase our vegetable consumption, I add a couple of zucchini squash, sliced in 4-5&#34; long spears, which I cook with the onions and peppers.  Makes a great and healthy addition."
5.0,This Fajita recipe is so full of flavor everytime! It has become a regular on our Family&#39;s menu!
5.0,"I ended up making this two nights in a row because everyone loved it so much! The first night, I forgot to add the paprika to the marinade so I added to the chicken right before cooking it. I thought it was more flavorful doing it that way. I might try not marinading at all next time."
5.0,The marinade adds so much flavor to the chicken!  Building your own fajitas is a really fun option when you have dinner guests or just for a normal nightly dinner.
5.0,The marinade is what makes these fajitas extra special!  My husband asked me to make sure and save this recipe :-)
5.0,My daughter
5.0,This is the best recipe I have found for Chicken Fajitas .
5.0,Super simple marinade makes for tasty home made fajiatas. I cooked the chicken before the onions and peppers and left them all to warm up together and we really enjoyed our meal!
5.0,Excellent flavor!  Will definitely make these again.
5.0,"Made it just like the recipe, it&#39;s my favorite dinner on the quick."
5.0,"By far, the best fajita seasoning mix I have come across!  Made it the first time as written, then for our taste the only thing I did different was decrease cumin to 1 tsp and a pinch and increase chili powder to 1/2 tsp and a pinch.  That&#39;s it!  I have used this for beef also but for beef use 1 Tbsp lemon and 1 Tbsp lime juice.  Absolutely the BEST homemade fajitas!!"
5.0,"This is the bomb, boom boom. Real authentic, real delicious!  No left overs, the plates were scraped... I will be making this my hit dish go to....Fantastically delicious!!!"
5.0,My family enjoys this fajita recipe so much that we have it once per month.  I add an extra two peppers and an extra onion.
5.0,"Loved the marinade, only changed a few things. Used boneless skinless chicken thighs because I prefer the dark meat. Added jalapenos with the bell peppers and Yellow onion, it was pretty dang spicy but I like a lot of heat. Also I added some of the marinade from inside the bag to the pan with all the veggies and put a lid on for the first 10 minutes to effectively steam them before blackening them on high. Served the whole thing on rice with refried black beans mixed in. Note: this recipe would also be great on nachos if you dice the chicken smaller or cook it whole and shred it."
5.0,This is my 3rd time making this awesome dish!  I had to look for it on the internet and found you because I remembered the recipe from before. I really enjoy these Chicken Fajitas??
5.0,I never leave reviews because I always forget but this recipe is amazing. Followed it exactly and am very impressed with how delicious and easy this is!
5.0,"This dish had the perfect blend of spices!  Very flavorful, but my mouth wasn&#39;t on fire.  My family loved this recipe!"
5.0,"Excellent!  I made a half-recipe for the two of us and served it with cheese-and-salsa rice.  DH  thought it was terrific, too.  Another keeper from ToH."
5.0,We LOVE this recipe! I have made it 3 times in a few months. It is flavorful and delicious! Made homemade tortillas to use with it. We only add salsa &amp; sour cream .
5.0,The whole family loves this one. I have made it using lemon juice in the marinade and like juice another time when we didn’t have any lemons. Great both ways.
5.0,Very flavorful. An easy make We really enjoyed it .
5.0,Made it tonight. Everyone enjoyed it. I will definitely make this again
5.0,Tasty!
5.0,Yummy
5.0,I tripled the amount for a dinner party and only added lime zest to the marinade. It was delicious!
5.0,"Doubled, had fajitas, just had the perfect meat and peppers for lunch, made enchiladas from leftovers and all were excellent."
5.0,"Wow there was soo much flavor. I cooked the chicken and veggies on the grill, which I think added that great grilled flavor!"
5.0,Love these easy to make fajitas.   I&#39;ve made them a few times with an easy pico de gallo salsa over rice and they are awesome each timr.
5.0,Made this last night on top of the stove... cooked chicken in the marinade without marinating it four hours... and it still turned out delicious.
5.0,"Absolutely delicious. Time was limited, so we did not refrigerate the chicken in the marinade for 1-4 hours, as directed by the recipe. We still found the chicken to be abundantly flavorful! So much so, that when making it again, we will not marinate the chicken, as it was absolutely delicious and obviously required less time/planning ahead.  Otherwise, there is not a thing I would suggest differently. I just wanted to point this out because often times the &#34;set in the refrigerater for x amount of hours&#34; deters one from choosing a particular recipe. So, I want to make it known that if you&#39;re looking for THE BEST CHICKEN FAJITAS but in a pinch for time, that is not a reason to pass this one up. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. This was printed off and put into our family cook book, as we will be making this often. Thank you for sharing! ?"
5.0,"These were delicious! My husband isn&#39;t usually a huge fan of fajitas. He still didn&#39;t eat the onions or peppers, but he ate tons of the chicken! It&#39;s a win in my book!"
5.0,"I made these yesterday. I cook for one (me). Absolutely delicious. You can trust the five stars on this one. I only marinated the chicken for less than an hour, and these were still delicious. I would love to make again and marinate for the full 4 hours. I ate some with corn tortillas, but I&#39;ve decided I&#39;m going to put this over rice tomorrow for a change. YUM!"
5.0,Great recipe! Absolutely delicious!
5.0,I am from South Texas and this is the best fajita marinade I have ever made. I highly recommend it as is. We did dive the chicken and then cooked it on the stovetop in the marinade.
5.0,"Like others, I used 1 T lemon juice and 1T. Lime juice. Just wondeting what people used for the seasoning  salt"
5.0,Love this recipe. Very tasty!
5.0,"I am not what you would call a professional cook, so making fajitas for the first time was nerve-wracking. But following this recipe and tweaking it to my liking, they were absolutely amazing! Even my mom enjoyed it, and she absolutely despises onions! They were 10x more delicious and flavourful than any fajita I&#39;ve had at a Mexican restaurant, and a huge improvement compared to our local one.  Personally, I used more lemon juice and a little less cummin. But since i like a little spice, I used a garlic jalapeno and even fresh jalapeno slices to give it an extra zing. Fresh cilantro chopped up really gives it an extra oomph too! I&#39;ve made it twice now and both times it&#39;s came out super delicious!"
5.0,"I only marinated for 30 minutes and it turned out delicious, next time will marinate longer. I did add chicken broth to pan to cook a bit longer to make sure it was well done and it came out very moist. Cooked it till broth was cooked up and then added veggies to fry up chicken."
5.0,"I used the recipe as a starting point and it turned out incredible.  First I added 1 Teaspoon each of ground cayenne, ground ancho chile, and ground chipotle chile.  This gave it a deeper smokie chili flavor without adding much heat.  Since a added more powders I also increased the oil to make it into a nice marinade paiste.  I pounded out the chicken breasts so they were equal in thickness and evenly spread the paiste over them.  When cooking the  chicken I started with a very hot grill and cooked them for a minute and a half on each side, removed them and let them rest of 20 minutes.  This left the chicken with nice grill marks and raw in the center.  I then sliced them into even stips and finished the cooking with the vegatables.  By cooking the chicken twice I could control the timing of the fajitas for the party we were having."
5.0,"This is a solid marinade.  I added a tablespoon of vinegar and a 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper for some spice and it turned out awesome.  I marinated for 3 hours.  It was a bit salty though, so I might bring it down to 1 teaspoon next time fyi."
5.0,This was my 1st time cooking anything remotely Mexican food. I wanted to learn how to make this for a dinner date. I done a test run and it turned out delicious! I however didn’t have time to marinate so I just slow cooked the chicken while letting it absorb the seasoning. I also added barbecue sauce in. I will definitely be making this again.
5.0,Prep time took me longer than 20 minutes but it was completely worth the time
5.0,"The more gem recipes I&#39;ve located and made on Taste of Home, the less and less I&#39;ve been enticed into going out to eat.  I can&#39;t think of the last time I had fajitas out that could beat this recipe.  There is NOTHING difficult about this recipe and the flavors are huge in this one.  Sometimes, I&#39;ve just used chicken tenders to save time.   But the only change &#39;ve ever made was to double the amount of bell peppers and chopped onions."
5.0,My family loves when I make this for dinner. The flavor is really good and I usually don’t have time to marinate the chicken for no longer than 30 min and it still comes out good. I’m sure if I took the time to marinate it longer the flavors would be even better but I’m fine with how it turns out.
5.0,"Extremely delicious, satisfies my cravings for restaurant Mexican food. I think marinating with the lemon juice makes a big difference."
5.0,"Excellent well rounded, full flavored recipe. Split between both chicken and flank steak. Will definitely make again. Home run."
5.0,"I’ve made these fajitas several times and we just LOVE them. The only changes I make to this recipe are that I use lime rather than lemon juice and I use a little more red pepper flakes to add a little more heat. I always make extra (sometimes even doubling the recipe) because we really like to eat it the next morning with eggs. Sometimes, we’ll mix the chicken, onions and peppers with beaten up eggs in a skillet and just scramble it all together. Sometimes, we’ll just warm the chicken, onions and peppers in a skillet and then serve it with an over easy egg or two right on top. YUM!"
5.0,Really liked this fajita recipe!!  Even the hubby liked it!!!
5.0,So easy and so tasty! I only marinaded the chicken for about 20 minutes (I was in a hurry) and it was still very flavorful. This will definitely become a staple for me.
5.0,loved all the spices marinaded for about 4 hours then cooked this will be the way i make fajijas from now on thanks
5.0,"I used lime juice instead of lemon, I just like it better, and I marinated whole thinly sliced chicken breasts for four hours.  It was fantastic! This is my new, go to chicken  fajita recipe."
5.0,"I didn&#39;t change anything.  My family loves this recipe and asks for it often.  Love the spices, better than packaged fajita seasoning."
5.0,"Loved this! Easy to make and delicious.  I did change a couple things, not minor. I used avocado oil, cut the Lemon juice down from 2 TBSP to 1TBSP and used 1TBSP of Lime Juice.  This recipe is a keeper, and will make it again and again!"
5.0,I first made this recipe about a year ago for a family gathering. It was so simple but so tasty and got rave reviews from everyone!  Since then I have made it many times and use this chicken on salads as well as in tortillas.

5.0,"Was looking for something different to make when I ran across this Fajita Recipe. Sounded very good and after reading several reviews decided to try it. I used less chicken than it called for I used Yellow, Red and Green Bell Peppers and Cut the onion in larger pieces. Did not have cumin so put in cilantro 1Tbsp of Lemon and 1Tbsp lime juice.  Marinated for about 2hrs. I love cooking in cast iron and I use a counter top hot place that I can adjust the temperature to precise numbers. I used 375 degrees. The flavors were absolutely wonderful. My Husband said that was the best Fajita he has ever had. Thanks for this fantastic recipe."
5.0,Awesome will be making again
5.0,My family and I loved this recipe!!! The chicken was so flavorful and we will be making this again??
5.0,This is the best chicken fajita recipe!!!!  I’ve tried several but none are as good and simple as this. My family loves them and now I make this meal at least once a week.
5.0,"Best fajitas I&#39;ve ever had, sand so easy to make! Better than at a restaurant. I plan on making these at least once a week!"
5.0,"This is the recipe that I as well have been making for years.  I have used 3 bananas with great results.  I also have switched sour cream for the buttermilk, great taste.  I did not read all the reviews, but most of them.  One thing I didn&#39;t see was anyone mentioning using this recipe and making mini muffins with it.  Just make sure the nut, if using, as finely chopped.  Bake for about 20 to 30 minutes...checking...Yum!"
5.0,"Hey, this is my recipe!  Found it in a cooking magazine back in the 70s.  An absolute favorite with no substitutions."
5.0,I would probably bake in two smaller pans as I thought it got a litte crusty on the outside in order to get the middle done.
5.0,This really is the &#34;Best Ever&#34; banana bread I have ever made.  I had to substitute the buttermilk and by accident I used baking powder instead of baking soda but it still turned out wonderful.  Can&#39;t wait to make this again with the correct ingredients!
5.0,So simple to make &amp; really delicious.  I&#39;m already thinking of making it again
5.0,"Made this bread exactly as it says, did not change any ingredients or measurements.  But instead of using a 9 x 5 in. loaf pan, I divided the batter into 2 smaller pans as I find the middle cooks beter. This bread has amazing flavor.  Next time I will add some milk chocolate chips."
5.0,"Great taste, texture and sooo easy to make. This will become a staple at our house."
5.0,"Made two batches, one with 1 cup of sugar and one with 1 1/2 cups, both were excellent.Baked for 60 min. Will make again."
5.0,Loved it so moist and flavorful..I also used 3 bananas.very good!
5.0,Made these into muffins. Used 3 very ripe bananas and just a little more walnuts.  We like walnuts. Cut back on the sugar to 1 cup. Wonderful flavor and very moist.  My husband really likes these.  Better then my old recipe.  This is a keeper.  Will be making these again.
5.0,I made this into muffins as it is hard for the two of us to get through a whole loaf of banana bread. We freeze some for later on 0 very sweet and like the idea of adding some cho. chips. - I also freeze whole banans if I can not get to baking right away - they work well after defrosting them.
5.0,Wonderful flavor.  I served it to my houseguests and they loved it.  Took the recipe home with them.
5.0,"This is indeed a wonderful banana bread recipe. My sister who hates bananas even had to admit that it was good! I did however read lots of reviews before making and I used only 1 cup of sugar. (1/2 brown &amp; 1/2 gran. sugar) And because I did not have buttermilk, I substituted with sour cream as suggested. And likewise with the walnuts. I only had pecans. The 1st time I tried the recipe I used an 11 cup pyrex dish as I saw that it made a really big loaf. I started to moniter the baking process at approx. 1 hr and tested center with a toothpick. This time I doubled the recipe making the same adjustments as before, except I used only 3 bananas (only had that many) and baked in a 13 x 9. I also put a thin coat of cream cheese frosting. It was crispy around the edges, which made it taste even better. Moist cake textured bread. Definitely a keeper."
5.0,"I have made this dish twice a week and hubby loves it more than i do. It isgoing to be a stable dish in myhouse now. And i am never ever ordering fajita in resturants anymore. It is so easy, convinent and delicious dish. Thank you for the receipe."
5.0,Am try to make it
5.0,"I have tried so many different fajita recipes and it seemed nothing was ever good enough. This is the best recipe for fajitas so far and ive been looking a long time. I didn&#39;t follow the directions exactly though. I used chicken I had precooked, dumped it into marinade for about 10 min tops while I sliced veggies. Then I put the chicken in a hot skillet with all the marinade. Let it heat a min before tossing in all the peppers and onion. Then I cooked it all til my preferred doneness of veggies."
5.0,"I have been making these for a few years now and they are ALWAYS a great meal.  You really don&#39;t need to change anything with this recipe, just follow it and enjoy."
5.0,Love fajitas! These hit the spot!
5.0,These were very good and flavorful! They are easy to make and a crowd pleaser.
5.0,Followed the recipe exactly and was delicious!
5.0,We loves inmy family. we use the seasongs for chicken tacos and nachos! Best ever!
5.0,Made exactly as written and they were some of the best fajitas I&#39;ve ever made!!
5.0,"Just made these tonight. Made exactly as instructed except I didn’t have oregano, just Italian seasoning mix so I used that. They were excellent. My husband said Yum! After first nite and proceeded to inhale 3 of them. Definitely a make again and again"
5.0,"To Cynthia below who cannot eat cooked bell pepper, Maybe some chopped pimentos?? They have that peppery taste (actually in cherry pepper family) but you can try the chopped ones in a jar. Just a thought and suggestion. Have not tried this recipe yet, but plan on within next week, recipe sound great."
5.0,"I&#39;ve made this twice and it is very flavorfully. Perfect amount of heat as is, for someone who likes spicy/hot but tongue can&#39;t handle too much. If you enjoy a good chicken fajita you should try."
5.0,So good and very easy to make. All I added was a couple of splashes of hot sauce.
5.0,"Wow, this really is a 5 star recipe. I made these into fajita bowls with cauliflower rice and it was really phenomenal. The chicken was so tender and the onions and peppers were delish. Definitely reccommend!"
5.0,So tasty!!! This will be an often used recipe at our house.
5.0,"These fajitas were delicious. I loved how the marinade formed a coating on the chicken. Also, it was a beautiful day outside so I left the chicken whole when marinating. Then, grilled it.  I will definitely make these again!"
5.0,DELICIOUS!!!! I only put my chicken in the marinade for an hour but still tasted amazing. Also I didn&#39;t have lemons so I used lime juice instead and nonetheless fajitas were amazing.
5.0,This was delicious the fist time so I had to do it again.Thank you
5.0,"This is AMAZINGLY GOOD!!! Delicious! I am the only female, I doubled the recipe for the four men in the house. I hardly had any left!!! Great recipe!!!! Definitely a keeper!!!!!! &lt;3"
5.0,This made delicious fajitas loaded with flavor but still somehow pleasantly mild.  They were especially good with the sour cream.  My family loved this recipe - definitely a keeper!
5.0,These are especially good.  My husband doesn&#39;t normally like leftovers but he asked me if we had enough left for another meal.  The only thing I did differently was to add yellow &amp; orange sliced peppers to the red and green. Very good meal.
5.0,"So tasty. Even my wife, who doesn&#39;t get excited about fajitas, thought they were good. I felt they could have used a lot more peppers and onions though. Next time I&#39;ll probably use twice as much. I also salted the peppers and onions while they sauteed."
5.0,So tasty.i love this recipe.
5.0,When your three year old son who only eats chicken nuggets says “this chicken is yummy mommy” you know you have a winner. This is a real delicious dish. I make it often now because it’s also so simple. Great quick weekday meal.
5.0,I made this and added shredded cabbage to the sauteed peppers and onions. I did add extra onions and peppers. I also added slightly more crushed red peppers. We absolutely loved this recipe. There is something about the lemon flavor that we liked. The hub went for seconds and said you can make a lot.
5.0,I was skeptical of this recipe but it was so flavorful and delicious! A hit with even my picky 5 year old!  I will for sure be making this again!
5.0,Successful weekday dinner!!! Super delicious and easy  to make. I would know... I am not the best cook lol.
5.0,I made this recipe hundreds of times starting back in 2000 when it first appeared in the magazine AND I was a newlywed.  My 13-year-old likes it and my 8-year-old just started to like it.  I just leave out the crushed red pepper flakes and I use red onion.  This recipe is in regular rotation in this house.
5.0,Easy and Delicious!!! I can fix side dishes while this is baking. Awesome!!!
5.0,Excellent!  Quick and easy to make!
5.0,I made these last night and they were really good!  I chopped my chicken into chunks instead of strips so they are easier to eat.  I will make them again soon!  I made enough for leftovers for salads this week!
5.0,"This is the best fajita recipe I&#39;ve found yet.  I prefer to sub lime juice in place of lemon juice, and I let the chicken marinate for a couple of hours.  Also, I dump the chicken plus marinade into the skillet, without discarding the sauce.  I love the inclusion of green onions in this recipe.  I usually serve it with homemade guacamole.  Everyone wants seconds!"
5.0,"Best fajita recipe ever!  My husband, who doesn&#39;t like &#34;too many vegetables&#34; in his dinner, gobbled these up.  I usually double the recipe; it reheats just fine."
5.0,"Very Good Mexican Flavored Fajitas... Hubby, Son  &amp; Grandbaby LOVED them.. Next time I&#39;ll add Black Beans per hubby&#39;s request... I did Saute Chicken in a Tab. Spoon of Butter &amp; used Veg. Oil for marinade as well... Will Defiantly be making again"
5.0,"This is a fab recipe! I make the seasoning in large quantity and use 2 tabs of it every time I make it, that way it saves a lot of time."
5.0,Fantastic!
5.0,Had this tonight and the chicken was so tender and flavorful!  Hubby and son loved this saying it&#39;s restaurant quality! A repeater for sure
5.0,"These were great!  I doubled the recipe and good thing, too.  I made three changes: halved the cumin, cooked the chicken along with the marinade (would have been impossible to separate anyway), and added extra salt.  I did include the crushed reds, as recommended.  We didn’t even eat them on tortillas (saving carbs) and they were still great!"
5.0,This was given a thumbs up by the whole family.  Easy and delicious!
5.0,I love chicken fajitas and this is definitely a keeper.  My Mom who is 92 loves it.  I marinate the chicken overnight and I wouldn&#39;t change a thing.
5.0,This is delicious!  I also made it with shrimp and it was also very good.
5.0,"This was soooooo good! Surprisingly, my hubs, who doesn&#39;t care for fajitas, had 3!!!! He said these were the best he&#39;s had! My son loved them too. Thanks for sharing!"
5.0,Excellent recipe!! Made as is except for using a bag of frozen bell peppers and onions.  Definite keeper!!
5.0,Delicious!
5.0,My husband and I LOVE this recipe! Better than fajitas from a Mexican restaurant.
5.0,I love this recipe.  I use frozen peppers and onions which makes it quick.  I also let them defrost and drain them so the dish is not watery.  I consider this  a quick meal. And so good.
5.0,"Delish! The whole family raved, and the best part is it is such an easy meal to prepare. I had a cooled roasted chicken I needed to use, so I cut the breasts into thin slices. One family member cannot have seasoned salt so I used garlic salt instead and eliminated the garlic powder. I tossed the chicken with the marinade and let it sit for just a couple minutes while I sliced the peppers and onions. I saut?ed the peppers and onions in one pan and heated the chicken in another since some family members don&#39;t prefer the peppers. Such a winner meal!"
5.0,I love fajitas and this recipe did not fail me. Delicious blend of spices! My husband prefers shrimp so for his I used the same seasonings and just added frozen shrimp instead of chicken. He said they were great!
5.0,I made this for dinner tonight for company and it was a hit. It goes really well with rice and refried beans. Super easy. I also used olive oil instead of what the recipe initially called for. I will be keeping this recipe for sure.
5.0,This was so delicious and simple. We like things spicy so I also sprinkled in some hot sauce and as I was saut?ing the meat I also sprinkled a few drops of liquid smoke. Yummy!
5.0,"This recipe is awesome as is!  My husband recommended broiling the chicken in our toaster oven to keep the meat tender, 10 minutes per side , and while cooking the vegetables in the pan.  It came together very quickly and turned out great!"
5.0,I have made this recipe a few times now and it is definitely flavorful! I make it exactly to the recipe and always refrigerate it overnight. This recipe is a keeper! Thank you! ??
5.0,My favorite chicken fajita recipe. Had this last night and for lunch today. Love it and so does my husband!
5.0,My husband and I really enjoyed these. I just usedthe regular onions and omitted the green onions.
5.0,Super tasty!  I made a couple tweaks as I don&#39;t have a grill.  Baked the chicken at 450 in the oven for 17 minutes (keeps the chicken juicy inside but cripsy out so you can kind of get that grill feeling). Also served with homemade guac.  See my full version here: https://goo.gl/4rfasy
5.0,I just cooked this recipe to a tee for my Cuban family and everybody loved it. I doubled the portions of everything to make more for a big group of people and made a cilantro salsa to top it off with that just put the final touch on this restaurant quality recipe! The only thing different was I let the chicken marinate overnight which was a good choice because the flavors infused into the chicken and I splashed lemon juice all over the final product to get it extra zest plus it just looks cool and like I know what I&#39;m doing. I don&#39;t. I&#39;m just good at following directions :) Absolutely delicious! This is now my go to fajita recipe!!
5.0,Very good!  Not salty and very good flavor.  Everybody loved it.  I put everything into the electric skillet and marinaded the chicken over night.
5.0,Fantastically delisious!! So very flavorful without the crazy spice. Will be making many times over! Thank you.
5.0,"This came out great but I cut down the cumin 1/4 teaspoon and the same with the chili powder and added a little extra garlic and added onion powder 1 teaspoon. Other than that, the longer it&#39;s marinated the better. I marinated it for 4 hours and used burrito tortillas. Also added rice. Really delicious, 4 people each had 2 with the fixings. Everyone was satisfied."
5.0,"This came out great but I reduced the c umin 1/4 teaspoon and the same with the chili powder and added a little extra garlic and added onion powder 1 teaspoon. Other than that, the longer it&#39;s marinated the better. I marinated it for 4 hours and used burrito tortillas. Also added rice. Really delicious, 4 people each had 2 with the fixings. Everyone was satisfied."
5.0,"Made today but I didn&#39;t have the seasoned salt.  Still came out amazing.  Family loved it!  It is definitely a keeper and a recipe worth repeating several times per year.  I actually turned on the broiler at the end, made up the fajitas by placing two tortillas on a sheet of aluminum foil and preparing two large fajitas to go under the broiler, just until the cheese starts bubbling.  They added salsa and sour cream and wrapped them up.  Sauteing the vegetables in the remaining liquid left from cooking chicken is important.  Cooked until they appear burnt in spots. Incredible!"
5.0,Delicious..Delicious..Delicious
5.0,Excellent! Made homemade tortillas. Makes it even better.
5.0,Quick and easy. I&#39;ve made this recipe three times now.  My family loves it. Definitely a recipe I will be using over and over.
5.0,The whole family loved it
5.0,"Delicious and flavorful!  I doubled the seasoning and used one whole each of red, yellow, and green bell pepper and one whole onion sliced (not too thin) just like they do at my favorite Mexican restaurant.  I made Spanish rice to go with our meal. Definitely a keeper!"
5.0,"Easy to prep, make, cook and oh so tasty."
5.0,Easy weeknight dinner!
5.0,"Quick and easy dinner. My family always loves chicken fajitas, and this recipe doesn&#39;t disappoint!"
5.0,"Saving this one!!! Although I only used the marinade, this is a keeper. I had roasted a whole chicken to use during the week. I wanted to do some chicken tacos and wanted a superior flavoring for the meat. I found this and it was perfect for what I wanted.. I mixed it up and let my chicken rest in this marinade for a bit and tossed it into the skillet to heat it up. It came out soooo goooood. I will be keeping this for sure! Thank you for sharing!"
5.0,"This is the absolute best fajita I ever ate!!! I like more veggies, so I&#39;ll add another pepper and some julienned onion the next time. However, it was totally wonderful just as written."
5.0,This was very delicious.  I used organic chicken breast tenderloins.
5.0,"I made this last night and it was excellent! The hubby said it was better than any restaurant. I made it as written except used olive oil, lemon and lime juice, and no red pepper flakes (should&#39;ve used them... needed a little kick). I charred up the peppers and onions in the broiler. Served with shredded mixed Mexican cheeses and sour cream. Delish!"
5.0,"Absolutely outstanding! These fajitas are better than the ones at my favorite Mexican restaurant. I made the following modifications: tripled the bell pepper/onion and added a coarsely-chopped tomato during the last few minutes of cooking the chicken. I also used heaping measuring spoons of all the spices. Served with sour cream and guacamole salad, there were no leftovers!"
5.0,I so agree with all the 5 star ratings for this recipe.  It is truly wonderful.  The chicken is perfectly seasoned.  Do not hesitate to try this recipe.  I will be making this one alot more often.
5.0,"Like a dumb ass, I&#39;ve been using a store bought seasoning package when I came across this recipe n discovered that I have all these ingediants at home! It is spectacular! My picky kids ate ever morsal. Defanetly going to make this a regular dish."
5.0,"Best fajita seasoning EVER! I always increase the veggies, usually 3-4 bell peppers and 2 onions.I never get fajitas at restaurants now because they&#39;re always so disappointing. Nothing is as flavorful as this recipe."
5.0,Fantastic!  Will certainly make again and again......
5.0,"I have now made these twice and they are the best fajitas I have EVER made!!!! But as some have commented, much better after marinating for at least 24 hours! The longer, the more flavorful!!!! Better than most restaurants!"
5.0,"First time making this dish without measuring, just put it all together and it is AWESOME!  I WILL BE MAKING THIS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN!  Easy to making, not time consuming!! I love it!!!! I give it 10 Stars!!!"
5.0,I made this without letting the chicken marinate because I was in a hurry and it was awesome.  I&#39;m sure it would be even better if it had time to marinate for a while.  I usually use store bought fajita seasoning but didn&#39;t have any so used this recipe.  The combination of seasonings was perfect and much better than what I have used from the store.  This recipe is a keeper.
5.0,"Thank you for a delicious and wonderful recipe. I followed the recipe to a tee , but I allowed my chicken to marinate overnight, I highly recommend doing so! The chicken was moist and the flavors were 10 times better then any fajita packet from the grocery store! My 2 yr old gobbled the chicken down and kept asking for more! This will be in our weekly rotation!! Please try this recipe and you won&#39;t be disappointed!!"
5.0,Hands down this is a great chicken fajita recipe. I&#39;ve tasted them before but never made them. This is the first time I ever made chicken fajitas.....lets just say that this recipe is definitely being added to my recipe book. The marinade is divine and packs a lot of flavor. I didnt let it sit for 24 hours. It was late so i let it sit for an hour and a half tops. That was all the time i needed. It was delicious. The marinade was so good that i could have eaten the chicken by itself. I&#39;ll will for sure be using this marinade for other recipes as well. My husband and son loved it.  Cant  wait to share this with my sisters at service.
5.0,I&#39;m a Volunteer Filed Editor and I love testing out recipes. The marinade in this recipe was just right!  We really enjoyed the flavours in this dish.  I cut everything up and let it sit while I got the kids from school.  It was nice to have the prep work done ahead of time as this allowed me to help the kids with homework right up till it was time to cook supper!
5.0,This is an amazing fajita recipe! We had them last night &amp; my whole family LOVED them! I made the recipe exact (including red pepper flakes) except I did allow the chicken to marinate over night. My family used to love the Applebee&#39;s sizzling fajita skillet &amp; they took it off the menu...I tried a couple copy cat recipes &amp; none were that close. THIS is almost exactly like it &amp; my son asked how I got the recipe from them! I will be making this very often &amp; am so glad this popped up in Pinterest for me!
5.0,Outstanding!  Followed recipe exactly except used a pre-chopped fajita veggie mix from the produce aisle.  Could not have been quicker or easier!  Thanks!
5.0,We just finish dinner and I got nice complements about this fajitas. I did it exactly as you say and they were amazing. IServed some tortillas but also some Boston lettuce leaves for those who I knew were going to have more than one.Definitely I will make them ofte.Thanks so much.
5.0,Awesome  GOOD!!!
5.0,Tried this a few weeks ago and my family is asking me to make it again.  This recipe is super easy and very tasty.  It will be in our meal rotation often.
5.0,"I have this almost memorized because I make this all the time.  The first time I made it, my boyfriend remarked &#34;, if I ordered this at a restaurant, I would be back the very next night&#34;.  I have made this at least 30 times and it is always fantastic.  This recipe is simple enough to be quick and easy and yet involves enough flavor to make you feel like you are simply amazing in the kitchen.  I typically double the marinade.  While the chicken is marinating, I chop vegetables.  I have been adding mushrooms lately and it&#39;s a great addition.  I cook the veggies first, be sure to add salt and pepper.  Then I cook chicken after marinating for at least 1 hour.  Mix it all together and voila.  I love to cook all the time, but this recipe has to be made regularly.  It&#39;s just that good!   And don&#39;t skip the red pepper.  Cleanup is also easy, it only requires a cutting board and a pan!"
5.0,We all loved this recipe.  I used lime juice instead of lemon juice.  I have also used skirt steak instead of chicken.  I prefer the chicken but hubs liked the steak better.  Both were very good.  It&#39;s so delicious and easy that I&#39;ve made it for friends many times.  One of our favorites.
5.0,"I have made this since it first appeared in 2000 and it is a keeper.  All family loves it, even the most picky grandkids.  Occasionally substitute lime juice for lemon just for a change, but for the most part follow recipe exactly as written except for adding more veggies, as one grandson can&#39;t get enough peppers and onions."
5.0,"We love to cook &amp; can be selective about spices....this combination was excellent. Per our preference, we used boneless/skinless chicken thighs. We warmed our flour tortillas on a cast iron pan until right before they toast too much to fold (adds another layer of yummy flavor). Good enough to make for company, goes together FAST. My only change will be to double the veggies &amp; onion."
5.0,"This was wonderful!  Both my husband and I loved this fajita seasoning.  The only change I made to the seasoning was to use lime juice instead of lemon juice.  As far as the rest goes - make other or more vegetables as desired!  We often make fajitas, so, we already know we like to cook one full onion and one each of the following bell peppers: red, green and yellow."
5.0,"Hadn&#39;t made fajitas before.  These were very good.  I thought it was a lot seasoning at first for the chicken, but blended well together.   I did add tomatoes with jalape?os to the veggies for more flavor and my husband and I like things with a little heat.  I did not put taco sauce on the fajita as I thought it would overpower the flavors.  Will definitely make these again!"
5.0,"This will be my new &#34;go to&#34; for fajitas.  I used to make a seasoning that had corn starch in it and it much prefer this one.  I made as is, but like someone else&#39;s post about lime juice as opposed to lemon juice.  I&#39;ll give that a try next time."
5.0,Wow!  These fajitas got it going on.  Easy to make.  Flavor is spot on.  I did use lime juice instead of lemon.  These made it in my receipe rotation for sure!
5.0,This was really good! Add some chopped coriander on top to garnish!
5.0,"This recipe was one of the Top 10 of 2015, and I heartily agree! I have made it several times and it never fails. (My only substitution was lime juice for the lemon.) Wonderful addition to my TexMex repertoire!"
5.0,"Amazing fajita recipe.  I&#39;ve never made them before and everyone raved.  The chicken comes so moist and tender...better than the restaurants.  The only change I made was, I marinaded the chicken all day (because I was at work) and not the recommended 1-4 hours the recipe suggested.  Definitely a keeper!!"
5.0,These are great....we love them.  We used chicken once and then skirt steak the next time.
5.0,"I didn&#39;t use lemon or lime juice and side have seasoned salt. I used Adobo instead. Marinated my chicken tenderloins for about 2 hours in the fridge. Used 1 1/2 yellow &amp; red peppers and 1 1/2 onions. Sauteed low and slow for about 45 min. Served with sour cream avocado, shredded cheese and refried beans. Delish! Super easy and a fast meal.  A yummy recipe."
5.0,I made this last night and will def make it again. I followed the recipe but added a little bit of cream cheese to the chicken once I put it back in the skillet and WOW! Definitely a winner recipe! Thanks for sharing! : )
5.0,"This is my 1st time submitting a review for an online recipe, although I use them often.  This time I was compelled to create a user ID so I could share how well these turned out.  I typically find online recipes too bland for my family, this one was an exception, although I did add a half tsp more of every spice in the recipe and more citrus and cilantro.   This is a very authentic (at least NA authentic) dish.   Tip: marinate the chicken for as long as possible"
5.0,"Delicious, my family love it!"
5.0,My family loves these
5.0,Love this receive. EZ!
5.0,This recipe is easy and my Family loves it!It has become a favourite on the Family menu! :)
5.0,"Make sure you cut the chicken into thin strips to cook quicker and make making wraps easier.  We did not use any spice that had heat in it. For 2 people, it produces at least 2 different meals. We put in a cut up tomato towards the end and it added great flavor."
5.0,I thought I would try this for a quick and easy dinner and I am glad I did. It was really flavorful. I did squeeze a little lime juice on the finished fajita. It just added a little extra zip.
5.0,I love anything fajita! This was enjoyed by all!
5.0,I tried this and the fajitas were delicious
5.0,Very good and easy to make. I followed the directions except I used a frozen bag of peppers and onions so I didn&#39;t have the prep time. These were great the next day too. Lots of flavor!
5.0,This is a fantastic recipe!  It&#39;s super easy and the result is delicious.
5.0,"My husband just asked that I cook more peppers and onions next time.  My teen boys and their friend ate it and loved it also, amazing!  They loved the slight spice that was just the right level for them."
5.0,Quick and incredible!!!! Awesome to have on hand! Will make over and over!
5.0,"My son with minimal cooking experience took the initiative to make supper one night. Lucky for us he found this recipe. Fantastic! Better than any fajitas I have ever had. Because he enjoys peppers, he used a whole pepper (red &amp; green) rather than just half as suggested.  I&#39;m am surprising him tomro, just finished prep work and marinating in basement fridge. Only need fresh guacamole and a little cilantro and we&#39;re set! Very happy Daddy!"
5.0,I will be making these all the time now. Delicious!
5.0,I made this for my picky nieces and they both loved it. Everyone else did too and it was so easy to make.
5.0,"This was absolutely delicious! I used lime juice instead of lemon juice. I marinated for 2 hrs and the chicken was really tender when I threw it in the pan. I know this should be common sense, but be sure to mix the marinade up in the baggy before adding the chicken so it distributes evenly. If you use hot Mexican chili powder use far less than the recipe states! Super spicy. I added mango slices to the pan toward the end of cooking time and added avocado and tomato on top of my tortilla. Mmmmm mango."
5.0,"Absolutely Delicious! I made this for myself, my hubby and our 7 year old daughter and it was a hit! I doubled the chicken and marinade and used whole green, red and yellow bell peppers. A quick, simple and great meal!"
5.0,Fabulous!
5.0,Very good recipe. I cut the chicken in strips after it&#39;s cooked.
5.0,"My family and I really enjoyed this fajita recipe! Delicious! I didn&#39;t add the pepper flakes because my 3 year old wouldn&#39;t eat it like that. We also added black beans, lettuce, guacamole, sour cream, salsa and cheese to our fajitas. :)"
5.0,Wonderful flavor. Only put in a pinch of pepper flakes because of little ones
5.0,"Fabulous recipe!  Wished I could give it 20 stars!  Who needs packet fajita mix, if you can make this.  This is a keeper in my recipe book.Julie, THANK YOU so much for sharing it with us all."
5.0,This recipe may have just changed my life.  I&#39;m going to make this time and time again.  Something so easy to make should not taste this amazing. The chicken has so much flavor.
5.0,"I added 1.5 lbs top sirloin steak and doubled this recipe and it was amazing! The marinade is what makes this recipe so delicious, flavorful, and juicy! Such a great recipe."
5.0,"I didn&#39;t have lemon juice so I used cut up pineapple pieces and squeezed them in the bag, threw them out before cooking because I didn&#39;t want a too tropical flavor, but next time might just cook it that way. Didn&#39;t taste the pineapple at all. I used 4 small breasts. Was delicious and one of my best meals ever."
5.0,"I made this for dinner for my mother and me.  I ate it without the cheese or tortilla.  It was delicious.  I marinated the onions and peppers separately.  I am not sure I needed to do that, but I like the added flavor.  I also used coconut cream for sour cream."
5.0,Delicious and quick if you prepare ingredients ahead of time. Husband says excellent taste of Mexican.
5.0,"This is really amazing. Like made am account just to say this is good, amazing. Additionally simple, cheap, and easy to modify."
5.0,Love them!!
5.0,Delicious!
5.0,"It&#39;s easier to slice uncooked boneless chicken breasts if they&#39;re partially frozen.  If fresh, place in the freezer for about 45 minutes before slicing.  The lime juice was an excellent idea."
5.0,"My husband and I love these fajitas. The only changes I make are to double the onion and pepper because I thought it needed more vegetables. The spice mixture is good, but I&#39;m going to try doubling it for the same amount of chicken today and see if it gives it a little more flavor. Quick, easy and delicious, especially with salsa and sour cream! You won&#39;t be disappointed!"
5.0,I have made these before and they are a hit every time.  It&#39;s a great idea for entertaining friend too.  It&#39;s fun to have everyone create their own frajitas from a assortment of toppings.  Don&#39;t forget the margaritas!!
5.0,I just made these for my family.  HUGE hit! We even have one picky little eater in this family. I doubled the veggies because the ratio between veggies and chicken tasted off .  Making again tomorrow.
5.0,"Great basic recipe that is easily adaptable to one&#39;s specific tastes. Be warned not to marinate too long with this recipe, though. The citric acid will eventually &#34;cook&#34; the chicken (in fact, this is how ceviche is made). As for freezing the chicken--yes, it can be easier to cut partially frozen chicken. However, if you are having a hard time cutting unfrozen chicken, the culprit is most likely a dull knife. Of course, many of us freeze chicken, but keep in mind that the process of freezing any meat will degrade the meat at least somewhat. Given a choice, I would always choose &#34;never been frozen&#34; chicken, and I certainly wouldn&#39;t freeze it just to make cutting it easier."
5.0,These were really very good and so easy!  The only change I made was to add Emeril&#39;s Southwest Seasoning to taste to the veggies when saut?ing.  Will make again.  The combination of seasonings in the marinade tasted like fajitas without a prepackaged mix.
5.0,"This was my first time making fajitas in a skillet since I&#39;m so used to barbecuing everything on a grill outside, but alas winter has started so I needed to find a good recipe after wasting my time and food trying other ones. I found this recipe and decided to give it a shot. Everyone loved it including my 5 and 7 year old! Their&#39;s didn&#39;t have any peppers though ;P I did use lime juice instead of lemon because of what I read on the comments section and it was awesome. Also I added a jalapeno to give it a little more kick for my hubby. The only thing I would do different would be to only use half the serving amount of oregano lol but that is just a preference. This recipe will be used again and again in my home :)"
5.0,Hello I did this for dinner tonight it&#39;s was  delicious
5.0,These fajitas are delicious.  Everyone at our fiesta loved them. Best fajita recipe out there
5.0,Everyone loved this recipe.  I think I could have used just 1 TBSP of oil to fry the onions and peppers in though.  Thanks for sharing!
5.0,"Delicious sounding, I cannot wait to make these."
5.0,i love this recipe! i&#39;ve been cooking fajitas using this recipe for a while now. The only thing i changed is using lime juice instead of lemon. It&#39;s also easier to add the dry seasonings to the bag before adding the juice and oil. It&#39;s less messy.
5.0,"Made this for dinner, terrific just as the recipe is listed. I added some mushrooms. Outstanding"
5.0,"Amazing, better than any fajitas at a restaurant!"
5.0,Excellent recipe.  Milder flavor with red and yellow bell peppers.
5.0,Family favorite.
5.0,"I thought this recipe was awesome (as did everyone else). I did sub blood orange olive oil for canola, lime juice for lemon, and I grilled whole boneless chicken breasts vs pan frying. I also made shrimp, which I did saute. I marinated for four to six hours. Seriously the best tasting fajitas I&#39;ve ever made, maybe the best I&#39;ve ever had. I didn&#39;t try the shrimp, but heard it was delicious, also."
5.0,Hands down the best fajitas i&#39;ve ever had. This recipe is a keeper!
5.0,"This recipe is my first attempt at fajitas and it was huge success!  As stated in ALL the other reviews, they are as good and maybe better than restaurant fajitas.  My only advice is maybe err on the side of too narrow strips of chicken.  I thought I was getting them thin, but not so. They were still yummy, just not traditional thin strips.  Also, may try in a cast iron skillet next time, just because!"
5.0,"So flavorful, never any leftovers"
5.0,This was my first time making this and it was so good.  The whole family loved it.  It&#39;s been added to my recipe box.
5.0,Better than any restaurant fajita I have ever had!
5.0,Sooooo good!!!  I made homemade Spanish rice to  add into the fajitas and it was great.  Will make again
5.0,We love these and have them often - I changed to lemon juice to lime juice and I like it even better...
5.0,"Hey. This is the best I&#39;ve had. My wife adores them and my kids love them.I switched to Lime juice instead of lemon juice before even starting it. The lime is far more aromatic when cooking with a better flavor as well. Great recipe, the chili powder and lime makes it!"
5.0,These have a perfect slice blend. I never think ahead enough to marinate things.  I just cut partially thawed chicken breasts and let them sit in the sauce mix just for as long as it took me to chop the vegetables. Worked great!  I also agree that lime instead of lemon juice is a wonderful swap. My husband loved these!

5.0,Very flavorful! We enjoyed our dinner .
5.0,Doubled the marinade and upped the citrus by doing a lemon and a lime.   Amazing taste and the family loved it!
5.0,"I loved these delicious fajitas.  Used 1 lb. of chicken, kept everything else the same."
5.0,Outstanding.......as good or better than any restaurant fajitas.  Easy to prepare...
5.0,"Very good. I marinated the meat for four hours and so and it turned out to be salty enough that it left no room for taco seasoning. But we added some anyway, so it was a little too salty. Next time I will add less cumin, because 1 and 1/2 tsps was a little too strong."
5.0,Not sure quite traditional but excellent!  We&#39;ll be making this frequently!
5.0,Not quite traditional but excellent!  We&#39;ll be making this frequently!
5.0,"Not quite traditional but excellent!  And as quick as it is to throw together, we&#39;ll be taking advantage of this great meal on a busy weeknight!"
5.0,Easy recipe and the chicken had good flavor!
5.0,I love this recipe and have made it countless times.  I have also made it with ground chicken. I just omit the extra oil for the pan when cooking. Turns out great!
5.0,"Easy, inexpensive, liked by all.  Fiber, carbs, veggies, protein...it&#39;s got it all...."
5.0,"I tried this recipe and boy, the chicken fajitas were delicious!!!"
5.0,Very tasty recipe would definitely make it again
5.0,5 star recipe the chicken fajitas were delicious...
5.0,ww 13 points
5.0,I added black beans to the party and it was excellent. I just used one large chicken breast and it lasted 3 days of constant yummy fajitas.  I also used some green onion and fresh cilantro through the cooking process.  This is a good foundation for a yummy Mexican fajita.
5.0,Best fajitas I have had to date!
5.0,"I made this with lime juice instead of lemon juice. I used some of those mini, multi colored bell peppers. This was so good! This is definitely a keeper! Thank you for sharing this recipe."
5.0,This is a keeper!  I&#39;ve been searching for &#34;the taste&#34; of restaurant chicken fajitas and have finally found it. Thank you!
5.0,PS I used fresh squeezed  lime juice instead of lemon juice too.
5.0,This recipe is one of the best I have ever made for marinating the chicken for the fajitas. Fantastic recipe! Try it..you won&#39;t be disappointed.
5.0,This marinade recipe is very good. I&#39;ve made it several times. I&#39;ve even used this recipe on steak for steak fajitas. It tastes really good for both chicken and steak fajitas.
5.0,ABSOLUTE DELISH!
5.0,"Really tasty recipe, I had all of the ingredients on hand. I will be making this one again :o)"
5.0,Loved this! This will be my go-to fajita recipe from now on!
5.0,My family likes these fajitas for supper but love the leftovers for breakfast the next day.   I make extra filling to mix into scrambled eggs for breakfast.
5.0,"These were so good and so easy to make.  Was supposed to feed 6, but 3 of us devoured these with no leftovers!"
5.0,"Great marinade, I wonder how it would work to make a bunch of marinade and cut and freeze the chicken for ready to go freezer meals.  Yum."
5.0,This was my first time making fajitas. We (+children) loved the flavor....not too spicy. The chicken was tender and topped with sour cream.  I will make this again!
5.0,Excellent and easy to make.  Truly &#34;best ever&#34;.  Substituted walnuts with choco chips.
5.0,I did make this bread twice already and I DIDmake SOME adaptations to suit my tastes!Thank you for sharing this recipe-it&#39;s GREAT!It&#39;s also quick! Dawn E. Lowenstein
5.0,"I baked the bread at 350o F. instead of 325o F.  I also baked the bread in two 8-1/2x4-1/2&#34; loaf pans and used 3 bananas instead of 2! I baked this bread for 50 to 55 minutes. I was very pleased with the results!  As I&#39;d stated in my previous rating,I did make recipe adaptations-I used 1/2 cup each chopped, dried apricots and candied fruit.  I just used 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  My second time around, I omittedthe walnuts and added 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips + 1/8 cup all-purpose flour so the fruit wouldn&#39;t sink to bottom of the loaf! I prepared this bread again 12/31/13 &amp; I used 3/4 cup candied fruit &amp; 3/4 cup Raisin Bran Crunch Cereal instead of the nuts and chocolate chips! This recipe is definitely a keeper!Thank you, Gert Kaiser, for sharing this recipe! delowenstein"
5.0,"I made this three weeks ago and added about alitle over a half cup of mini choc chips. OMG!!! This is the receipe I will ever use again. Fast , easy and delish, what more could you ask for."
5.0,Made this banana bread tonight and it was fantastic.  I made on substitution out of necessity.  I didn&#39;t have buttermilk so I used sour cream.  I have everything ready to bake another for work in the morning.  This will definately be my keeper for banana bread.
5.0,"Made this without nuts for my Grandsons, EXCELLENT, can&#39;t wait to make it with the walnuts! This is delicious!"
5.0,"My mother made wonderful banana bread, but when I tried this recipe, it really was the best ever banana bread I&#39;ve ever tasted."
5.0,"I hadn&#39;t thought about making banana bread before, but I have a large quantity of walnuts sent to me from my grandpa (who hand picked and shelled BUCKETS of them).  I was excited to try this recipe based on the many awesome reviews &amp; boy were they spot on!  I did chop the nuts pretty small, as I don&#39;t really care for giant nuts in bread.  Next time though I&#39;ll make an exception and leave them a bit bigger, by request of my dad who loves the walnuts and appreciates my grandpa&#39;s hard work! ;)  I did leave three muffins without nuts just to see the difference and enjoyed them both ways.  I followed a few suggestions from other bakers; I only put in a cup of sugar (3/4 regular and 1/4 brown), I put in three bananas and I added cinnamon (a lot because it&#39;s my favorite!) and I thought they came out great!  I made regular size muffins and would love to figure out how to make a topping for them (maybe granola or something else to add a crunch or caramelized texture), I&#39;m open to suggestions!"
5.0,Seriously the best banana bread I&#39;ve ever made or had!  Recipe as-is is wonderful.  I&#39;ve added 1/2 cup of Reese&#39;s peanut butter chips to the batter and it is absolutely crazy good!! I also divide mine into smaller pans and adjust cooking time and temperatures.
5.0,the BEST banana bread ever.  i cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup and add an extra banana plus chocolate chips
5.0,"Excellent bread! I have tried many, many recipes over the years(my family LOVES bananas); needless to say this is truly the &#34;Best.&#34;Made it in 3 mini-loaf pans(of course had to adjust time due to small size of pans), and added another banana. It was delicious and easy!"
5.0,HAVEN&#39;T MADE I YETBUT IT LOOKS GOOD
5.0,HAVEN&#39;T MADE I YET
5.0,HAVEN&#39;T MADE I YET
5.0,This is a great recipe!  I make it as Muffins and add raisins and often call it breakfast!  Thanks.
5.0,"Very good recipe.  Would definitely make this again.  Like other reviewers, I only added 1 cup of sugar and it was plenty.  Also used 3 bananas instead of 2.  Be sure to check for doneness before the amount of time called for.  Mine only baked for 1 hour and 5 minutes.  Ovens really vary!"
5.0,"Wonderful, quick recipe.  This one&#39;s going into the tried and true file ;-)"
5.0,"Fantastic flavor! You don&#39;t even need tortillas, just eating it plain is absolutely delicious!"
5.0,Our family liked this recipe.  Even my daughters that don&#39;t like peppers.
5.0,I love this recipe. I marinated the chicken overnight though and it had a terrific kick to it. I also added lettuce to the add on choices. Thank you so much for sharing this.
5.0,This was very good will put it in the keep file
5.0,This is a old recipe I got from taste of home years ago and have been making it ever since.  I moved and misplaced my recipe and found it a few months later and was so happy.  If you try it you will love it.   do not change anything. it is perfect exactly how it is.
5.0,This is the best chicken fajita recipe that I&#39;ve tried. I sub 1 teaspoon salt for the seasoned salt and I use olive oil instead of canola oil. Everyone that has tried these raves about them.
5.0,"My entire family loved this recipe.  We all love peppers and chose to add 3 or 4 peppers, rather than the 1 pepper that is recommended.  We also prepared the peppers by roasting them in the oven first and then peeling them.  Then added them to the onion mixture.  We also grilled the chicken so we did not cut the chicken into strips until after it was cooked."
5.0,"My family and i love the chicken fajitas.that was the first time i made them,my 3year old even said good.it was the first my 66 year old grandma even ate a fajita, i told her i was going to make it like toro loco and she said she never even ate their so i was very pleased when she injoyed her meal i also made spanish rice and homeade refried beans. I will make it again it just might become a regular dish."
5.0,I love this recipe. I make it at least 2 times a month-- it is quick and easy and we all love it.
5.0,Made the recipe exactly as written but also added beef strips.  My family loved these fajitas and said they were the best I had ever made......a keeper!
5.0,I thought it was delicious.  My husband asked for the recipe so he can make it at the fire station.  The only thing I changed was using lime juice instead of lemon juice because that is what I had on hand.  Excellent recipe.
5.0,"I have been making this recipe for years, I make up the seasoning mix ahead of time and keep it in a sealed container. I also use lime juice instead of the lemon, gives it a great authentic flavor. This is a recipe I use in our once a month cooking menu.!!"
5.0,"I had always wanted to make fajitas on my own...when finding this recipe I couldn&#39;t wait to try it. It will now become one of our favorite mexican recipes. The flavor is  delicious, and chicken is so moist when marinating with this combo of spices, I LOVED the lemon in it..Hubby said they were the best he had ever eaten. I did not use the red pepper flakes nor the green onion...it was perfect and I will make this again and again. This recipe is a keeper!"
5.0,"This was so good! The flavor was perfect. I didn&#39;t have fresh peppers and onions, so I used a frozen blend and they ended up pretty limp, so I will use fresh next time, but it still tasted great. Super quick and easy, too."
5.0,"My boyfriend and I LOVE this recipe.  It&#39;s so easy to make, and even if I forget to marinate the chicken the night before, it&#39;s unbelievably flavorful in just an hour two.  Wonderful!"
5.0,"My husband and I love this recipe. I use more peppers, ( red, yellow and orange) and onions. The last time I made these my husband said that this is his favorite meal that I make. He said he would love to have them once a week. I usually serve Spanish rice or refried beans with them. Great recipe, Julie."
5.0,Great recipe! Definitely a keeper!
5.0,Loved this recipe!  The only thing I did differently was double the marinade mix.  Meat was tender and so flavorful!
5.0,Awesome recipe! Better then Mexican restaurant chicken Fajitas.
5.0,"I could not believe how good this was and it&#39;s SO easy!  I had all the spices in my pantry for the marinade and always have lemons on hand.  This is definitely a keeper.  I&#39;ll even make this for company sometime, too!"
5.0,My husband and I think this is as good as the Mexican restaurants in our area if not better.
5.0,YUM!
5.0,"This is an excellent recipe!  I did modify it a little.   I cut up chicken breasts into strips and placed them in a crockpot.  I then added the rest of the ingredients except for the peppers and onions.  I cooked it on low all day.  I also sauted the peppers and onions and then placed them in the crockpot about an hour before eating.  Needless to say, there wasn&#39;t much left over.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe."
5.0,This chicken fajitas recipe is one my family has enjoyed for many years! The is also good on a salad.
5.0,Delicious!! We loved the leftover chicken in salads the next day. Excellent seasoning combination...all ingredients I had on hand. Thanks for the recipe:)
5.0,I really like this recipe.  I admit that I used to use packaged seasoning mixes because I couldn&#39;t find a recipe I liked the seasonings in but this was awesome.
5.0,My family loved it.  I will definitely make this again.
5.0,"I make these ALL THE TIME!  Thanks to this recipe, my 2 toddlers are eating peppers and loving them.  I like to make a huge batch of the seasoning up at one time to have on hand.  This recipe also works perfectly if you want to make a freezer meal kit... just slice the chicken and put in a freezer bag - you could even make up the seasoning marinade and pour into the bag before freezing.  Then slice up the peppers and onions and put in a separate bag.  When it comes time to cook, just defrost the chicken in the fridge... the peppers and onions can be cooked right from the freezer.  One of my top recipes from Taste of Home ever, love love love this."
5.0,I have tried many fajita recipes and I was always disappointed. Until now. This one was great.  Only change I would make is to cut back on the salt.
5.0,<p>I made this last night for dinner and everyone really liked it. I liked that it was so easy. I didn&#39;t have lemon juice so I used lime instead. I will make this again for sure.</p>
5.0,This recipe was great but spicey. I will make this a lot but without the red pepper flakes. Even my kids loved this!
5.0,very good. I didnt add the red pepper flakes cause I dont have &#39;em but it was still delicious.
5.0,awesome
5.0,"I just add a little crushed red pepper flakes, one red and one green pepper.  We love it"
5.0,"Instead of using chicken for this recipe, I used a Butterball Apple Wood Smoked Turkey.  Since it was fully cooked, I kept the sauted peppers (red &amp; yellow) and onions in the pan and added the turkey to heat it up.  This was sooooo yummy!"
5.0,My husbands and I favorite dish. This is definitely a keeper to pass down to my children.
5.0,Excellent flavor.  I&#39;ve made this many times.
5.0,This is one of my family&#39;s favorite dishes! They taste great!
5.0,I thought the presentation looked very delicious! The ingredients are easy to use and find!
5.0,I made it with store bought pie dough still was delicious and easy love it thank you
5.0,Well if i want a sweeter pie i thought i&#39;d use Gala Apple&#39;s But my mom said that the texture is different and that gala Apple&#39;s would most likely fall apart so maybe in the future i&#39;ll try that. by the way love the recipe so good i used store bought so good but i&#39;ll try homemade next time!
5.0,Delicious! Used 9 large apples and doubled the sugar-spice and it made 3 regular size pies!
5.0,Perfect. I baked it longer but may have had more filling.
5.0,"Making this Apple pie for the second time and I love it. I live in Yakima, Washington and its  Apple season here. I usally don&#39;t bake, but this was so easy to make and simple. I did use a little bit more sugar than it asked for in the recipe."
5.0,"I had lots of apples left from a recent visit to a friend&#39;s orchard so I 
decided to make a pie.  Found this one through a Google search and it 
looked good.  I used half Ambrosia and half Ginger gold apples.  I think
 Granny Smiths would have been better,  it was still very good,  just a 
little sweeter than I would have liked."
5.0,perfection
5.0,Really good pie filling recipe!  My first time making an apple pie.  I only had Honeycrisp and Golden Delicious apples so I used those.  Came out great!  I did cheat and use Pillisbury refridgerated pie crusts.  I made it on Wednesday night and didn&#39;t cut/server it until Thursday (Thanksgiving Day).  It was perfect!
5.0,"This recipe by far is out of this world! My first time making apple pie! 😍 I made it last night and  it turned out So delicious ! We love love love it!!! I did used variety apples as indicated from the helpful tips!  I added a little little more dough than requested by increasing by 1/2 more since I love thick crust, and for filling i have added 1 teaspoon of allspice to give a unique taste. Baking time took longer for the extra thick crust by 8-10 min. Thanks for sharing this recipe and the great tips- very helpful!"
5.0,This Apple pie is amazing. I added other ingredients to it like coconut and it was so nice.
5.0,"We used my mother-in-law&#39;s wonderful recipe for 30 years, but after I tried this recipe I filed my old one away!  My husband and all of my kids and their families say this is &#34;The Best Ever Banana Bread&#34;."
5.0,"I loved this recipe with a few variations due to my families preferences...I added 1 TBSP of Cinnamon, 1/2 tsp Nutmeg and a dash of cloves...plus I used brown sugar in place of the sugar.  It stays moist and delicious to the very end (but it doesn&#39;t last long at our house)."
5.0,I loved the recipe. I also changed a few things like used 3/4 of sugar and added mini chocolate chips and a teaspoon of nutmeg. I doesn&#39;t last long at my house.
5.0,"The title says it all, it is the BEST EVER! The only thing I did different was to use raisins instead of walnuts. And I made it in my Breadman bread machine. It has a setting for batter breads. I am making it again tomorrow as soon as I buy more bananas!"
5.0,This banana bread is just like its name Best ever Banana BRead I have had great complements on this recipe
5.0,This is a fantastic recipe...my kids are begging me to make it again!
5.0,I have made this recipe over 10 times.  It is the best ever banana bread.
5.0,I love how moist this banana bread it. We have this as a desert drizzled with honey. Sometimes I add chocolate chips or craisans. I&#39;ve shared this recipe with all the bakers in my family. They all love it.
5.0,Fabulous!  Easy and delicious.
5.0,This is the best banana nut bread I&#39;ve ever had! I love it!!!
5.0,This really is the best banana bread I&#39;ve ever tasted!
5.0,this was excellent everyone loved it
5.0,"I&#39;ve been using this recipe for years, yes, from Bon Appetite, and it never fails to get rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  I do use a little less sugar, 1 1/4 cups because I prefer it a little less sweet."
5.0,This Banana Nut Bread was the best I&#39;ve tasted. I did add 3 bananas as other recommended. Definitely a keeper!
5.0,Best Banana bread I&#39;ve every tasted. Definitely a keeper!
5.0,"I really enjoyed making this pie today. It was sweet and spiced just right. It made a hit with the family and was truly a snap to make. I did cheat by using a good quality frozen crust, I beat my egg white nicely and brushed a good bit all over the crust and then gave it a generous sprinkling of sugar. My top crust was made by using a maple leaf cookie cutter stamp and just covering the entire top of the pie with leaves. I just love how pretty it makes the pie! Just beautiful for Fall! This recipe is a keeper! Thank You!"
5.0,"This was a great classic apple pie. It did come out looking wet but you have to let fruit pies cool before you cut them. I let mine cool overnight and it was perfect the next day- no run off and no soggy bottom. For those who say the apples weren’t tender, you need to test the pie by sticking it with something to make sure they are soft before you take it out. If your crust is getting too brown, put on a pie shield or foil."
5.0,I can\&#39;t figure out why this is getting less than 5 stars. It was amazing! Not wet or runny at all. I used a double crust (store bought) and 5 granny Smith apples. I followed the recipe as written. Scratching my head about these other reviews. It turned out fabulous.
5.0,"This is probably one of the easiest apple pie recipes ever.  I have been baking almost my entire life, usually using my mom&#39;s recipe.  After she passed away, I was unable to replicate it, but THIS is DARN close.  I only use granny smith apples, I use less sugar and brown sugar (slightly less than half a cup per pie), a bit more cinnamon, about the same nutmeg and flour. I skip the ginger, as I don&#39;t think the pie needs it. I don&#39;t care for a pie that is TOO sweet, so I am pretty liberal with the lemon juice.  (I might add a teaspoon more of flour, depending on how crazy I went with the lemon juice.)  I generally don&#39;t sugar the crust, but that is my preference.  I made two apple and two pumpkin pies for Thanksgiving this year, and needless to say, there were NO leftovers.  To those that have a problem with the filling being too wet, I suggest using extremely crisp granny smith apples.  The peel should be dark green.  If the texture of the apple is &#34;mealy&#34;, it is over ripe and will probably be too wet.  Thanks for this great recipe and the lovely memories it gave me of baking with my mom."
5.0,I made this pie today and it is so good ....I didn&#39;t add ginger or nutmeg. It wasn&#39;t soupy at all ! I think that comment was very nice at all. Thanks for the recipe.????
5.0,This is the 4th time I have made this pie...comes out perfect every time!!
5.0,"This filling  added tablespoon brandy and teaspoon vanilla, but did everything else as directed. This filling recipe is our favorite coupled with a butter  and sour cream crust. Delicious!!!"
5.0,"Best apple pie filling!! The apple slices were crisp, not soggy, the recipe was easy to follow, and the advice was a plus. My friends gave the pie filling rave reviews. This will be the one I use for now on."
5.0,I love this recipe!!!! The pie was delicious!! And it’s so easy!! I did use a ready made pie crust which worked out great!!!
5.0,"This was delicious and I even skipped the white sugar. Due to heath and latent food allergies, I limit my sugar and I can not use sugar substitutes.  Has anyone else ever altered the recipe? I think I will try it without any sugar next time.  Also, can anyone recommend a tool that helps you figure out the nutrition value, this way I can see the grams of sugar based on my alterations.  Thanks again, grandma knew what she was doing."
5.0,Made it as a tart using half a pie crust. Loved this so simple recipe.
5.0,"I needed to use some golden delicious apples before they went bad. Never have attempted a homemade apple pie. Used this recipe...OH MY GOODNESS, I am hooked! It is so good!"
5.0,I did the recipe to the T because I saw a review complain that everyone tweaks the recipe and reviews their version rather than the original recipe and they are right. So I followed the recipe exactly and it is absolutely delicious. I will critique it though. Ginger was a little too strong especially paired with the nutmeg it truly over powered the cinnamon taste. It definitely came out liquid-y however I found when you let it cool for about 45 mins the liquid becomes less runny. I used a Pillsbury pie crust. Phenomenal. I did set up the pie crust and the sugar mixture first then sliced the apples up and mix together to avoid letting the apple pie filling become to watery. Didn’t really change anything. But the pie is truly delicious without adding or subtracting any ingredients.
5.0,"Excellent recipe, I added a few things and tweaked the sugars. I also highly recommend using more than one type of apple for better flavor. I use Macs, cortland and Granny Smith. Makes for great flavors."
5.0,I made this pie last night and i have to say it is the best recipe i have ever tried! it was delicious and will now be my new &#34;go to&#34; apple pie recipe!!!
5.0,"A doctor it up a little bit;, less sugar and a scoosh of nutmeg. I bake and give away and I’m told this is the best apple pie ever"
5.0,"This is an AMAZING PIE. I actually didn’t look at reviews before baking and actually kinda shocked to see them lol. I did follow the recipe to a t. Yes, I will admit the pie is a bit liquidy AT FIRST BUT after a half hour there was no more liquid pouring out.  Taste wise, it’s amazing you can taste everything perfectly. Maybe a little to much cinnamon, but thats preference.  baking wise, it did take a little bit longer than said but if you just keep your eye on it and put foil around places that are getting to brown it’ll come out beautifully.  Either way would bake again, saving the recipe"
5.0,"This was my first foray into baking an apple pie. I&#39;ve done lots of different cakes, pies, and cupcakes, but I&#39;ve been a limited intimidated with the apple pie. Well, my son wanted an apple pie for his birthday and so, it was the right time to just go for it. I chose this recipe because it was simple and straightforward. I did read through many of the reviews, which are very mixed--from best pie to worst pie. Honestly, that made me a little nervous, but I decided to remain positive and give it a shot. The result was spectacular!!! I had my son eat the first piece and he was incredibly happy. He said it was the best pie he has ever had and went back for a 2nd even bigger slice. I took the next slice, and I was also impressed with just how good it tasted and how  well everything came out.  I will note that I followed the directions, without any changes. I used only Granny Smith apples and I didn&#39;t have any issues with the filling becoming too liquidy or the apples not baking well enough. The pie&#39;s taste is amazing. I thought the proportion of the spices was completely appropriate so no one spice stood out too harshly. Honestly, the hardest part for me was making the crust, which I also decided to do for the first time. I was actually worried most about the double crust, but it somehow all worked out. Phew! I would definitely recommend this recipe. It&#39;s worth taking a chance."
5.0,I have made this recipe twice now. Once with nuts and once without. It is by far the best banana bread I&#39;ve ever had!!! (Shhhhh.....Don&#39;t tell my grandma)
5.0,The name of this recipe is spot on!  It is the best ever banana bread and SO easy too!  The outside has a wonderful crunch and the inside is so rich and flavorful!  It is the only recipe I will use from now on!
5.0,"Can you believe the people who did not give 5 stars or even gave a review yet did not follow recipe directions. PEOPLE! If you don&#39;t follow recipe directions and change what is supposed to be done and it didn&#39;t turn out the way it was supposed to then don&#39;t rate low. Not recipe fault, your fault."
5.0,If I could give it six stars I would! This is definitely the BEST ever banana bread.
5.0,"For a delicious gooey top, cover it with aluminum foil when it first comes out of the oven.  This is a wonderful recipe!"
5.0,Truly is the best banana bread I&#39;ve had.  Perfect texture and flavor.  Only change was to substitute sour cream for the buttermilk.
5.0,"Any suggestions would be appreciated ! I tried this twice today and both times it fell in the middle 10 minutes before the cook time was up. The oven thermometer holds steady at 325 degrees. I live at 7,000 ft  but other breads I have tried have done fine."
5.0,"Really a nice recipe.  My family cannot have nuts, so I sub in raisins instead."
5.0,"very nice,,,daisyh, try making mini loaves.  That is what I do and cut the baking time down and they did not fall and they came out perfectly.  I really love this recipe."
5.0,Best banana bread I ever had!
5.0,"I&#39;ve been making this same recipe since the 1970&#39;s.  I found it in a Bon Appetite magazine.  Everyone who tries it, loves it!"
5.0,"It was moist and good.  My family loved it.  We added a glaze that made it even better:Glaze for one loaf:  3/8 c. sugar, 1/4 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp melted butter, 1/8 c. orange juice (or lemon juice or grapefruit juice plus a little water)  Mix.  Poke holes and put on top of loaf."
5.0,This is a great recipe for banana bread.  I love how it&#39;s crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.
5.0,"Love this recipe and have used it for years.  It is quite sweet and could be just as good with less sugar.  I cliped this recipe out of Taste of Home Mag. in 1991 issue.  So, to deenadu, maybe allrecipes.com got it from Taste of Home.  Don&#39;t be too quick to judge."
5.0,Has anyone substituted applesauce for part of the oil? I would like to cut down on calories and fat but don&#39;t want to ruin the end result.
5.0,"Best apple pie I ever made!  I will say one thing, I put heaping tablespoons of flour and it came out perfect.  After reading a review saying they heaped the flour, I decided to do that.  It came out perfect!  Thank you Taste of Home!  My family was so thrilled with my pie!"
5.0,I’m a 14 year old baker and I’ve always wanted to make an apple pie but I always thought it was too hard. I found this recipe and I was astonished by how easy it seemed. This pie came out so well when I made it. My whole family loved it so I already made it twice in the last week! This apple pie recipe is so good and very simple to make. I will definitely continue to make this pie for the rest of my life!
5.0,"This pie was delicious! It was the first homemade pie I ever made, but the recipe was easy, it included items I usually already have in the kitchen, and it didn&#39;t take much time to prep. However, I only had Gala apples which made the pie perfectly sweet, but not too sweet. I didn&#39;t have any ginger so I missed out on that intended kick the recipe included. The top layer of my crust was still raw after 25 mins, so I added 13 more minutes...it was then half- undercooked, so I added 10 more minutes and adjusted to 400 degrees. Maybe I had the pie on a rack too low in the oven. All I know that in the end, it was delicious!"
5.0,"OMG, this was an amazing pie. I have made so many things for my family and me, and this was by far their favorite thing I&#39;ve ever made. I read the reviews before and used heaping tablespoons and it worked out great. I didn&#39;t measure out my lemon juice. I honestly just poured whatever the apples needed :D I actually really liked a little bit of that lemon flavor. I would recommend some more some cinnamon, but I really love cinnamon so that&#39;s your choice lol. I used a pre-made frozen pie crust, and as you can see, it worked out great. Ovbiously, I had to buy some more to get the top covered. I recommend to not be shy with the egg whites! I brushed all the egg white on the top, and I&#39;m glad I did. I thought about not using all of it, but I did, and got a great pie. All in all, this was the most awesome pie ever! SO glad I found this recipe. &lt;3"
5.0,This is the first apple pie I&#39;ve ever mad and is seriously one of THE BEST apple pies I&#39;ve ever tasted!!! I followed the heaping tablespoon suggestion for the flour but all the other directions as is. I believe I&#39;ve made another dish better than my mother-in-law and she&#39;s been making her pie for well over 50 years. My husband was pleasantly surprised!
5.0,I have made this pie at least five times and each time I get rave reviews. My grandmother and mother said its the best apple pie they&#39;ve ever had.   I do cook it a little longer to make certain the apples aren&#39;t crunchy. Delicious ?? ??
5.0,"Lovely recipe. For those who had issues with soupy pie or apples that did not cook up, try making sure that you are using a baking type apple as opposed to a &#34;snack variety.&#34; They are not successfully exchanged."
5.0,These recipes look great! It’s awesome to see so many delicious recipes in one place.
5.0,Best apple pie I&#39;ve ever made!  And I have it on good authority - two experts at eating apple pie - a grandson and a neighbour!
5.0,"I have a ton of apples and decided to make Apple pie. I’ve always heard Granny Smith apples make the best pies. It turns out it’s because tart apples have the most pectin and other apples can make your pie soupy. Lesson learned... either use Granny Smith or allow apples to macerate and release juices prior to baking. Watery or not, the pie was still delicious!"
5.0,Very Quick and easy - I usually use 5-6 small apples to make  9-inch pie crust.
5.0,"FOR those complaining about the juice that comes out of the pie right when you take it out that’s normal you have to let it rest like the direcrions  say so it can jellify, so yes Gavin you threw away a perfectly good pie, DAB"
5.0,Update to earlier post. I did not use ginger /nutmeg- only bc none on hand .. still 5????
5.0,laughing at all those who don’t realize that you cannot cut into an apple pie that’s fresh out of the oven. great recipe
5.0,"PLEASE BE RESPECTFUL and limit comments to only the RECIPE, and ADVISE others.     do not attack another&#39;s character with with profanity (baker2) ...... Keep in mind that MANY have NEVER, ever baked before."
5.0,First time making homemade pie and it&#39;s delicious!!!! Very easy to follow...thank you!
5.0,"I made this pie last night, followed the recipe exactly, used gala apples and it came out perfect. great pie!!"
5.0,This pie was delicious !!! After reading the reviews I decided to make the tablespoons of flour into heaping tablespoons and the pie turned out perfect. Will be making this one again!
5.0,"This is the best banana bread I&#39;ve ever had, I made it for my family, friends, and church, they all rave about it. Last week I did an experiment, substituted home made cinnamon apple sauce for the bananas, came out really good, the people of my church really liked it. I just made a loaf, didn&#39;t have any buttermilk, so i melted 3 table spoons of butter added 2 table spoons of half and half. the loaf came out just as good. Great Reciepe."
5.0,This banana bread deserves more than *10* stars.  I use this recipe exclusively!!
5.0,"I will also only be using this recipe from now on. Finally a banana bread that is moist and that I can taste the banana in! Added a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg and 3 bananas. Hubby says instead of trying to eat the banana&#39;s before they get overripe as usual, we&#39;ll purposefully leave them to brown just so we can have this bread as often as possible."
5.0,"I&#39;m not even a huge fan of banana bread, but this was just delicious.  I left out the nuts since we didn&#39;t have them in the house.  I will be saving this and using it as my standby for banana bread."
5.0,Fantastic! I was even able to make this in a gluten free version for my fiancé who is gluten intolerant. Tasted amazing!
5.0,This is my favorite banana bread recipe.
5.0,"OMG...this is the best banana bread ever!  So very flavorful and moist.  As suggested, I used 3 bananas and did not have buttermilk, so used whipped cream &amp; few dollops of butter.  I was contemplating adding the spices &amp; brown sugar suggested in the other reviews, but do not want to alter such a perfect, yummy recipe."
5.0,This is the only banana bread recipe I will make from now on.  Great!
5.0,This recipe is fantastic!  I&#39;ve made it many times and wouldn&#39;t change a thing;  except I usually use 3 bananas.
5.0,This is  TRULY THE BEST Banana Bread recipe I&#39;ve tried; and I&#39;ve tried a few. It is versatile and good just as it stands.
5.0,"I choose this recipe because it only needed 2 bananas for a loaf.  I had 5 available and I wanted two loafs.  This was such delicious banana bread.  I didn&#39;t have buttermilk and just used regular milk too.  I didn&#39;t have Canola oil, so I used vegetable oil.  This is so moist and a lovely brown loaf when baked in metal pans.  I loved the chewy texture to the ends of the loaf. All the kids agree, and want to keep eating it.  Even my girl that doesn&#39;t like bananas loved it.  Yeah! I will definitely make it again!"
5.0,"Terrific, I cut down to 3/4 cup of white sugar and 1/4 c. brown sugar and next time will cut it even more... however; I, also, used melted butter because I did not have oil ..it was decadent."
5.0,So moist and delicious!
5.0,"I made this yesterday and it&#39;s very good  --  very moist and flavorful -- I used 3 bananas as suggested by others and it had a nice banana flavor.   Mine took an extra 10 minutes of baking time, and thus, got a little dark, but that might be my old oven.   I think next time, I will try substituting melted butter for the canola oil -- I prefer baking with butter."
5.0,Thanks Domsmom827 for your suggestions!!!  I used butter in place of oil and used part brown sugar part white sugar and it truly IS the BEST EVER banana bread!!  I omitted the walnuts too.  My husband never liked banana bread until I made this!!!  Also I always had trouble with my bread baking all the way thru w/o becoming to done.  Not anymore!!  :D
5.0,"BEST apple pie i have ever tasted... just the right combination of ingredients.  i followed the recipe exactly as it was written and it was really excellent.  Everyone i shared the pie with agreed, it was the BEST..  i loved the story about your granny.... that was just the best.... i will forever think of her everytime i make this pie - which will be often."
5.0,Very easy to make. Thank you
5.0,I have been baking this recipe for years and love to experiment with a combination of different apples when available here in Namibia. The only time I have been disappointed is when I did not bake it long enough. Now I always check for the clear syrup to bubble out of the vent before removing from the oven. Great Flavor and very easy to make.
5.0,I think the recipe is delicious.  I noticed some of you found it soupy.  Not that I am an expert but I think some apples have more juice in them then others.  Maybe if you are using an extra juicy apple you will have to add a little more flour.  Just a suggestion.
5.0,Second time making.....first time too much liquid......i used my canned apples...drained all juice.........put extra cinnamon.......excellent.....! Will continue using this simple recipe.....
5.0,Outstanding!!! Used Granny Smith apples - got rave reviews from all folks at the campground. I didn&#39;t have nutmeg and forgot to add the butter - oh well. Still awesome taste and texture the next day. Definitely a keeper to make again with homemade vanilla ice cream. Yummy.
5.0,I have never baked a pie before but this came out amazing ! I didn’t use any ginger and only used 2lbs of apples witch I recommend. I also used Macintosh apples (they were a tad bit sour) But over all it was very delicious !!
5.0,Amazing
5.0,Best apple pie ever
5.0,A classic treat. Followed the recipe exactly except for the egg wash and sugar on top of the crust at the end.
5.0,This is by far the best apple pie I have ever made and eaten. I think it is the brown sugar instead of all white sugar. Whatever it is it is fantastic!
5.0,"Very good apple pie recipe! I lost my cookbook that I had for 30 years, which contained my Apple Pie Recipe. I had an idea of all the ingredients I needed but wasn&#39;t quite sure on the measurements. Found your recipe and it was fabulous! I love the use of all 3 spices and the brown sugar. Thanks for sharing this recipe! It&#39;s already in my new cookbook I&#39;ve started. :)"
5.0,"So at first the pie was soupy when I took a slice, but the flavors were amazing. The pie sat in the fridge all last night and all day today, it still looked soupy were the slice was taken. I took another slice and...no more soup! This recipe is great, thanks for sharing (I wouldn’t!)."
5.0,"This is a wonderful apple pie recipe, best I&#39;ve made.  Ive seen some reference to the pie being soupy.  I didn&#39;t experience that at all.  We let the pie rest for a few hours after it came out of the oven.  It was perfect when we sliced and served (a la mode of course! )"
5.0,Wonderful pie!!!
5.0,This was a hit. I left the sugar the same but used about 9 cups of sliced apples-we like our pie deep dish.
5.0,"This recipe turned out great! I just made it for thanksgiving. I did add an extra tbsp of flour as other reviewers advised, and the results were not runny at all, or dry. Also for the sugar I let my half cups measures be slightly short, and it didn&#39;t turn out too sweet. Also for the ginger, instead of powder I used paste and slightly more since its fresh. I used 4 granny Smith, and 2 honeycrisp apples. The results were fabulous. I&#39;ve made apple pie in the past using recipes found here or there and the flavor was always missing something. I&#39;m not sure if it is the use of ginger, or that I use ceylon cinnamon, but this recipe is a keeper."
5.0,Best recipe I’ve used in a long time!
5.0,Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. Will be making for Christmas.
5.0,Extremely tasty! Had some liquid inside but was delicious otherwise.
5.0,"Delicious pie! I used my favorite go-to homemade pastry dough recipe for the crust. I used 4 granny smith apples and 2 honeycrisp apples .  That combination was perfect for us. Just the right amount of tart and sweet. TIP FOR ALL: If you dont want runny pies heres what to do; Mix your fruit with your sugars and lemon juice, let sit for at least 30 minutes, dump the juices that have been rendered out into a small sauce pan, boil it gently for about 5-10 minutes to form a syrup (you can add a teaspoon or so more of sugar at this point to thicken up your syrup if needed) let it cool slightly then add it back to your fruit and sugar, mix well then add your flour. This works every single time with every kind of pie. You will not have any more runny pie filling. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!"
5.0,No hassle apple pie recipe. Cooked to perfection.
5.0,"For a novice pie crafter, I and my coworkers raved about this recipe. Easy and unnaturally delicious.I used Granny Smith, Breaburn and Jonagolds for two pies, just enough tart and sweet and bulk for pie filling. I&#39;ll keep this for other times when apple pies are called for."
5.0,"I made this pie today and it turned out very nice but next time I&#39;ll skip the ginger.  About apples, if you live in an area that has fresh picked apples you are very lucky.  Apples after being stored lose moisture and this will cause your pie to be dry unless you add a little fluid or less flour.  Used fresh picked Granny Smith (4) and only (2) Honeycrisp because they were huge and so sweet and tart too.  All in all, this 85 year old man is glad he found this recipe."
5.0,Great recipe.  I used 6 cups of apples and 4 T of flour and it was perfect.  I used granny smith apples.  Thanks for the recipe.  It is my new go to recipe for apple pie.
5.0,fabulous and what a pie....
5.0,It&#39;s a good recipe. I opted out the ginger just because I&#39;m not much of a ginger fan. I used 6 granny Smiths apple and 1honey crisp. It was alittle too Tarte. Next time I&#39;ll use another honey crisp apple and less granny Smiths. Wish I could add a picture.
5.0,"For a pie novice like me this was an easy recipe to put together, the taste of apple mixture was good. My problem was that the apples were a little too soft.  I cooked the pie the amount of time stated in the recipe. Maybe I sliced them too thin or I overcooked it.  How thick should the apples cut ? I used 7 cups of Granny Smith apples.  I am a better cake baker but this was a marvelous start to perfect !   Cannot wait to try it again. My husband said it was good never the less......"
5.0,Flavorful and delicious!
5.0,BEST apple pie recipe that I&#39;ve ever made.  Everyone loved it.
5.0,"I love this pie and make it often! I’ve found that  thinner and consistent apple slices are best, and you have to let it cool completely (up to 2 hours) to avoid soupiness. I also like to do an open weave with the top crust, which may allow for extra evaporation.  Lastly, I cook it for about an hour total 30 with foil, 30 without."
5.0,The best apple pie I have ever eaten!!!
5.0,Every hood and tastu!
5.0,Huge hit with the entire family!! We did cut the sugar back by 1/4 cup and will probably reduce it more next time.  Like others we also add ed some cinnamon and nutmeg to suit our family&#39;s taste.
5.0,Made this today and it&#39;s been a family favorite for years :-) :-)
5.0,"This stayed so moist, even after it cooled for days later. I followed it perfectly, but left out the nuts. This recipe is a keeper!"
5.0,"Love this recipe! Make it all the time, really easy and tastes amazing. Also if you dont have butter milk just take some regular milk and vinegar, it makes the same thickness and doesnt taste any different. it&#39;s 1tbls vinegar to every cup of milk and set for 5 min while your mixing up everything else. so in a 1/4 cup of milk i would just put 1 tsp vinegar."
5.0,Really good recipe didn&#39;t have canola oil use vegetable oil and it was delicious!
5.0,wow!! amazing banana flavor ...very soft n moist...cant resist eating another piece :) this bread is awsome...definately a keeper ! used 3 bananas as suggested by other reviewers...thanks to all :) 3 do make a big diff. in taste...used a cup of brown sugar...n added a few blueberries just at top which made the bread look really pretty!! didnt sink in the batter even... baked in a foil loaf pan n a small pyrex dish......used baking powder as i only had it at hand....baking time was exact as recipe states....no added nuts cuz my kids r not a huge fan of nuts....will definately be making it again....though will use 1/3cup of oil next time just to chk if it still stays moist enough...its outside was crusty...n i liked it ! my neighbour did it too....her remarks were &#34;excellent&#34; thanks to TOH :) thumbs up!
5.0,Great and easy!
5.0,"Best ever banana bread!!!! Its in the oven as we speak, second time I&#39;ve made it in 2 weeks!!  I do add a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, and an extra banana."
5.0,"Threw out ALL the other banana bread recipes in my collection, this the BEST one ever!  For variety, I added mini semi-sweet chocolate chips to satisfy the choco-aholic in me."
5.0,"Wow! Super, super good banana bread! All other banana bread recipes are now worthless. I did what some other reviews suggested and I added an extra banana (mine were on the smaller side anyway) and also a tsp of cinnamon to the dry mixture. I also didn&#39;t have any buttermilk so I made my own substitution (1/4 cup milk with 1-1/4 tsp of lemon juice, let it sit for 5-10 minutes). Next time I may add some mini-chocolate chips for a real dessert!"
5.0,I am just starting to really experiment in the kitchen. I think I have a burnt thumb lol. I really wanted to try and make banana bread. I was scared and prepared to fail but this recipe was so easy...My boyfriend was very appreciative I used the suggestions of the extra banana and cinnamon...sooooo yummy and moist and delicious.. Will probably make again as soon as this loaf runs out..highly recommend this recipe to all beginners
5.0,I have been making this recipe for years and years originally from the Taste of Home Magazine. It is the best banana bread recipe I have ever tried and is my staple one. Whenever I bring this in to work everyone swarms around it! Be sure your bananas are very ripe and it will make the bread moist and sweet! I&#39;ve even tried it with some natural sugar substitutes and although the texture is a bit different it still tastes great.
5.0,"Having loved Bananas but about 6 or 7 years I find I have what I can only call an &#39;allergy to any type of Raw Bananas&#39;, so after experimenting I know I can eat Dried Banana Chips and Banana Bread/Cakes. This recipe works for me, so, as I needed a super quick and easy recipe that works I found this one... BRILLIANT!! and though I&#39;m not used to the US Electric Fahrenheit 325&#39;F measure i just converted it to Centigrade 160-165&#39;C (in the UK I would use a Gas Oven GAS MARK 3) .  On with my version of the cake...  As one of my son prefers chocolate cake and hubby always likes nuts of some type in his cake, I too added cinnamon &amp; sliced my bananas to save extra washing up dishes but then added chocolate fondant, Walnuts and Cadbury&#39;s Drinking Chocolate (i reduced the amount of sugar to 1 cup due to the sugar in the fondant (i had no chocolate in the cupboards) added a little milk (approx a quarter cup) and a drop more oil to keep the cake moist) it turned out fine, not quite as moist and squidgy as the usual banana chocolate cake you&#39;d expect but whoever tasted it say its perfectly fine. RESULT... Everone&#39;s is happy and said basically what a &#39;yummylishious!&#39; cake."
5.0,This banana bread truly is amazing! My husband and kids can&#39;t get enough of it. I always double the recipe so can make two loaves. I also use 6 bananas because I love the banana flavor and I leave out the walnuts. Wonderful recipe!
5.0,excellent flavor....used Granny Smith apples..they are my favorite!!
5.0,"This was the best apple pie i have ever tasted in my life. I made it exactly as written, so simple and nobody believed i made it. Thank goodness my daughter witnessed it. Thanks so much"
5.0,awesome pie.reminds me of home in the fall .playing outside as a kid down to my grandmothers. smelling the pie mixed with the ocean breeze. salt air .spruce trees and a homemade apple pie.cannot beat them three smells together. along with the waves crashing the beach.Ahhhhh wish i was back home in maine.
5.0,I wish there was a higher rating then five stars. This was my. First homemade apple pie and it came out the best I&#39;ve had in my life and that&#39;s not just because I made it haha. There were a few different changes I made and that is 1. I used the homemade pie crust recipe off of crisco container. 2. I skipped the egg white and made a melted butter with sugar and cinnamon to brush on before baking. I know it&#39;s not the healthier choice but it added some great flavor to the crust. 3. I substituted the flour for tapioca because my grandmothers secret is it adds a little extra sweetness and flavor.  Also I forgot to set the timer and didn&#39;t read the cover with foil part so I accidentally skipped out on that so it was uncovered for about 45 minutes. Apples weren&#39;t mushy but also not hard . Right in the middle. I used janigolds and  Mitzu apples that we picked at the orchard.
5.0,This is my go to apple pie recipe. So easy and so delicious.  Love it!
5.0,Wonderful recipe. The only thing I did different was leave out all spices since I love the taste of only apples. I also laid a piece of foil over entire pie first 25 min then uncovered and finished baking 25-30 min until apples are tender when pie poked with thin knife.
5.0,"Very good, just a bit too much nutmeg though since we don&#39;t really like it.  I&#39;ll try cloves instead next time."
5.0,Fantastic pie.  I use 1 tab. cornstarch w/ 2 tab. flour.   I don &#39;t like nutmeg so I use ALL  cinnamon.
5.0,The best apple pie I have ever tasted. My homemade crust was pretty good also.
5.0,I&#39;m not a usually a fan of pie but a lot of people in my family like it so I decided to make it. I listened to the other reviewers and added an extra 1/2 tbsp of flour. And I added a little extra cinnamon because who doesn&#39;t like extra cinnamon? Anyway the pie came out perfect. It had fantastic flavor and wasn&#39;t very runny.
5.0,"This is the perfect apple pie!  I used my own pie crust recipe though because it is tried and true.  Two tips abou the pie filling.  1). I used a combination of Jonagold and Granny Smith apples but increased the amount of apple to 9 cups.  This was just right for the stated amount of sugar, flour, and seasoning.  Juicy but not runny.  2). Baking time needs to be increased substantially.  I started with the stated time but the pie was not nearly done.  Baked another 30 minutes, checking frequently to be sure it was not over baking.  Apples should be nice and &#34;oozy&#34; and very tender.  With these two minor modifications, fabulous results!"
5.0,"WOW!! Being a lover of Apple Pie,I was always intimidated to attempt to bake one.Well I got brave  tonight and I went for it.This is the best Apple Pie I&#39;ve ever eaten in my life,and I made it.I love taste of home,I&#39;ve made some delicious meals from the recipes.This one I&#39;ll be making for years to come.Absolutely Delicious"
5.0,"This was my first apple pie I&#39;ve ever made. My family and I loved it. Great flavor. Wouldn&#39;t change anything, it&#39;s perfect."
5.0,"Awesome... Tapioca to thwart the runs... Winner! Also, NO ginger. Don&#39;t like!"
5.0,"Wonderful. I made this w my daughter, it was simple to make and delicious to eat!  Yum!"
5.0,My very first Apple Pie and it was delicious ~
5.0,Only 6 more days before my husband deploys and an apple pie was on his list of wants. I have never made an apple pie before and was scared this would be a big flop. To my surprise this is the best apple pie I have ever tasted. Glad I could make this for him. Thanks so much!
5.0,"I have found THE apple pie recipe for keeps.  My husband and 29 yearold son were drooling over this pie!  I used granny smith apples,4 tablespoons of flour (not one drippy run), didn&#39;t have nutmeg, butused a little pumpkin pie spice, and cardamom in addition to cinnamonand ginger.  I used Trader Joe&#39;s pie dough and I&#39;m telling you it is utterlydelicious!!"
5.0,I loved this recipe! It was simple and just what I was looking for. I loved the sugar on top of the crust. I used pink lady apples. The perfect combination of sweet and tart!
5.0,"This recipe is fantastic. I would NOT, however, add much extra flour. I took the advice of some previous reviews and used 5 tbsp flour instead of the recommend 3 tbsp, and the pie filling was too sticky. Next time I will use 3-4 and it should be perfect :)"
5.0,Great recipie
5.0,"I couldn&#39;t find any egg whites or some of the other ingredients but it turned out perfect none the less. I might be only 14, but this was very simple and exciting! It was the first thing I&#39;d ever made on my own. Adding extra butter made it even better. Sometimes accidents make things better. I used a Wholly Wholesome gluten free crust because I have celiac."
5.0,I made it exactly as written. It turned out excellent!
5.0,Only one thing I didn&#39;t go covet the pan first. The sticks at the bottom.
5.0,Excellent flavor! Everyone loved it.
5.0,Am I the only one who cannot see what temperature to bake this at?
5.0,I had to use orange juice instead of lemon and I added 1/2 cup blueberries it was a great recipe
5.0,"FANTASTIC! Made this for Thanksgiving dinner this year, after family agreed they wanted an apple pie. The filling set up perfect, so cut like  a dream. I loved the spice and sugar levels, was just perfect. Will be adding to my go-to list of desserts. :)"
5.0,Loved this!  It&#39;s beautiful to look at and so tasty too!
5.0,This was fabulous! Thank you for sharing
5.0,This recipe is AWESOME!!!! Simple and easy to follow directions.
5.0,This was the best pie ever. Easy to follow and easy to modify to own tastes (less sugar).Thank you.
5.0,I made this for a pie auction at church and it had the room buzzing!  The winning bidder told me later in the week that it was fantastic!
5.0,"I used all granny smiths, which weighed 2.97 lbs. The spices and sugar amounts were right on, actually perfecto!  Sliced apples real thin, about 1/16 inch or so. Increased flour to 5 tblsps. Consistency of cooked mixture was very nice. My supreme critic, Wifey, said she would have used a couple of Macs or Fujis, thought a couple of apple slices were a little hard - though she gobbled it down. First time for me with a two crust pie. Will add a Fuji or two in the next attempt with this wonderful recipe.Which will be soon. With ice cream maybe? Perfect on its own.  I used a &#34;1-2-3&#34; crust recipe listed on the net. Excellent and easy pie crust recipe."
5.0,"I never  write reviews, but this pie was awesome! It was quick and easy to make and had the perfect combination of spices. Also, for those of you who were wondering, you&#39;d need about 5 regular sized apples.The only thing I would change is the sugar, it was a bit too much for my family. I would cut one of the sugars in half, also I did not listen others and increase the flour, but It may have helped the runnyness. It was not runny per say but could have used a bit of extra thickener.  Lastly I made this in a regular round metal cake pan with the same cooking time and it worked out great. Thanks for a lovely recipe!*I used criscos no fail pie crust recipe"
5.0,"Simply outstanding. I searched for a banana bread made with oil rather than butter, so this fit the bill. No mixer needed, just stir until blended and bake. I reduced sugar to 1 1/4 cups and substituted banana extract in place of vanilla. The combination of oil in place of butter and lower baking temperature yielded a tall, moist, and flavorful loaf."
5.0,This is great and easy to make. I did add an extra banana which made it more moist but it is not needed. I also used 4 mini loaf pans and baked them 40 minutes. I have made other banana breads and this is my favorite.
5.0,"I read every review and then made my version.   I added 1-tsp. cinnamon and nutmeg tothe flour.  1-cup sugar; 3-bananas; 1-stk. melted butter; 1-tsp banana extract.  Baked it70-minutes.  Goes without saying, this is absolutely the best ever banana bread.  My husband loved it so much, before going to bed I sliced a piece, buttered it and left itfor him to toast next morning.  Have bought more bananas to ripen for another loaf."
5.0,The whole Family loves this Bread! Outstanding recipe!
5.0,"Amazing! I added cinnamon and an extra banana. I am going to get mini loaf pans, and then double the recipe then make it. I will say how it goes!"
5.0,"Great recipe, it is a bit sweeter than I would like. Since this is my husband&#39;s favorite I&#39;m making it for the second time this week. I did add a dash of cinnamon."
5.0,I reduced the sugar to 1 cup as per suggestions. I reduced the oil by half and replaced it with more banana and some applesauce. I also replaced almost all the flour with whole wheat flour. A healthier version that still tasted great - the kids loved it!
5.0,"Wow!  This banana bread really IS the best I&#39;ve ever had!  I&#39;m not a big nut eater, so I changed those out for milk chocolate toffee bits.  My family is doing backflips! ??  Just go ahead and double the recipe.  You will definitely want an extra loaf, if just to share with another lucky family!  Enjoy!"
5.0,"This is the best banana bread I have ever made and the only recipe I will use from now on.  I do admit that I have made a couple of changes (use melted unsalted butter instead of oil, reduced the sugar to 1 cup, increased the number of bananas to three, increased the buttermilk by another tbsp, added some cinnamon and left out the nuts), but the recipe also works well as written.  I prefer to bake mine in a 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 pan for 1 hour and 10 minutes. Delicious!"
5.0,"This is the best, best, best banana bread!  I followed the recipe except I used coconut oil.  And I added some unused chocolate chips.  It did overflow in the 9in x 5in loaf pan so next time, I&#39;ll put some batter in muffin cups.  The flavor was perfect.  I made this last week and meant to save the recipe.  Well, I forgot.  So today I was searching the internet for over an hour trying to find the recipe.  Finally, I used my internet history and found it!  Thank you for this version.  Very tasty."
5.0,This has become my family&#39;s go-to recipe for banana bread! We all love the tremendous flavor!
5.0,instead of all tart apples I used granny smith buabaum abd fujie apples and increast the cinnimon to 1 1/2 teaspoons turned out fantastic
5.0,I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and found it to be the absolute best apple pie I have ever tasted. Thank you for sharing this fantastic recipe.
5.0,I made this pie for thanksgiving dinner. It was great. Will make it again.
5.0,"Made this pie for Thanksgiving, was going to make a pumpkin pie, but then my son-in-law gave me some apples, so made this one instead, and everyone loved it."
5.0,"I&#39;ve made this pie twice now and it was delicious both times! One variation that my dad remembers from his childhood is to use an oatmeal crisp on top rather than a second pie crust. I used the crisp recipe from this site &#34;Winning Apple Crisp&#34; but made the rest of the pie as directed on this site, covering the entire pie for the first 20 minutes. Incredible!"
5.0,This is an amazing Apple Pie - it is yummy and reheats very well! A big hit at our New Year&#39;s Eve party. Will repeat recipe for the next family/friends event. Highly recommended!
5.0,"I&#39;ve used this recipe for the last two Thanksgivings and it comes out great!  I read the reviews and decided to scoop the apples out of the large bowl, instead of pouring them.  That kept the pie from being too soupy.  This recipe is a keeper!"
5.0,Excellent taste. Totally worth trying. Definitely a classic.
5.0,This will be my new go-to apple pie recipe - it&#39;s great!  I used all Granny Smith apples and added two extra tablespoons of flour as recommended here by some and it came out perfect.  I served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of caramel sauce and it was a huge hit!
5.0,"My first apple pie &amp; my lifelong recipe. Be sure to COOL COMPLETELY before slicing! I used this filling in empanadas &amp; wontons, too!"
5.0,"This is a very easy apple pie and delicious. I use orange juice if I don&#39;t have lemon . It is a good pie to make an impression, if you are a first time pie maker. The pie crust from a box is tasty. I have made this apple pie recipe a few times ."
5.0,I make this pie with soft white wheat flour and replace the sugar with succannot. EVERYONE LOVES it and we don&#39;t have to feel to guilty.:) I have made it for church and it is always gone.
5.0,This is the first dessert our guests grab at our Labor Day barbecue.  I bake 2 of these delicious apple pies and they are gone almost as soon as I put them on the table.
5.0,I forgot to click on the stars to rate this recipe when I wrote my review.  I give it 5 yummy stars.
5.0,So good.  And I even forgot to dot with the buter before adding the top crust! Rave reviews from entire family.
5.0,This pie filling is the best I have ever had....and I didn&#39;t use a regular pie crust...I used the pie crust from the Dutch Apple Pie recipe...to die for!!!!
5.0,Made this recipe today to take to friends&#39; for dinner.  She&#39;s diabetic so swapped out the sugars for Splendas &amp; added 5 T. of flour - got 2 thumbs up!!!  It set up beautifully!  Everyone loved it (better than my mom&#39;s &amp; i didn&#39;t think that was possible!!).  Definitely a keeper!!
5.0,"Made only one of these pies for Thanksgiving. I cut it into tiny slices so that none would be wasted by my grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Only those who were at my house first got any! My son who does not care for sweets ate about half of the pie. His son who does not like apple pie ate two slices of it and loved it. The rest of us got a sliver of it and wanted more!! I made it with Splenda in place of the sugar as my husband and I are diabetic. Needless to say, I am making at least three or four of these pies for Christmas. I am sure there will be none left over!!"
5.0,"This is the first apple pie I have made and it got rave reviews.  I went by the recipe using 7 cups of apples. I used half Gala and half Braeburn and sliced them pretty thin.  I found the pie to be a good consistency, not runny at all, even after cutting, the filling does not run out in the empty area."
5.0,Very good!! First apple pie I made..definately will make again!
5.0,I also use the additional 3 Tablespoons of flour.  I also normally use two or three different kinds of apples.  This is by far our favorite recipe!
5.0,Truly delicious.  I&#39;ve found my favourite pie recipe.
5.0,So good and so easy.  My husband loves it so It is definitely a keeper.  I used green apples since that was what I had on hand and they were delicious.
5.0,I add some oatmeal to absorb some of the juice.
5.0,I maid this for my brother and  sister in law but as I was putting it in I realizedthat I forgot the butter.They said that it was the best apple pie that they ever had.(I still think that it could of used butter:)
5.0,I made the Apple Pie today. Came out ok. I read the other reviews several cooks said they added additional flour to thicken the mixture. I used granny smith apples so they don&#39;t produce a lot of juice so I didn&#39;t need the addition flour that is required in with more juicy apples. I did find the pie was a bit too sweet. My fault again I should have tasted my apples.
5.0,I get asked for this recipe all the time!
5.0,This turned out great family loved it and like another person I forgot the butter too.  It was still great with out it.  Would be really good with homemade whip cream.
5.0,I made this at the spur of the moment for company today.  I had the pie prepared &amp; in the oven in less than an hour.  I used the silicone pie crust protector that I got from the Shop Taste of Home web site &amp; it worked great!  My pie turned out perfect &amp; the only thing I will change next time is I will bake it just a tad longer or maybe at a slightly higher temp as I am at a high altitude.
5.0,"My review didn&#39;t show the 5 stars I gave this recipe, so resubmitting."
5.0,I lost my Mom&#39;s recipe and tried this one.  It was easy to make and had great flavor.  My fiance went back for a second serving so I know it was good!
5.0,Over and over and over. This is by far the best apple pie recipe I have found.
5.0,"I&#39;ve never made a pie before, and I used this Apple Pie Recipe as my first attempt and it turned out Great! YUM! :)"
5.0,"This pie is great! Everyone loves it, everytime. It isn&#39;t too sweet for me. To avoid it being runny, scoop the apples out of the bowl instead of dumping them into the crust. That way, any leftover mixture that didn&#39;t coat onto the apples will remain in the bowl. A+ Recipe!"
5.0,"As a member of our local American Legion, I often donate baked goods to our monthly steak nights. What says America more than homemade apple pie! This recipe is super easy and delicious! Will definitely make again and again!"
5.0,"We loved the pie, after reading the reviews I did added 3 heafing tablespoons of flour to thicken the pie. Came out great I served the Apple Pie for dinner with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the top."
5.0,I just made this apple pie today and it came out wonderful! That&#39;s saying a lot because I am not a big fan of apple pie. I added a tiny bit of clove because I like that flavor. Great recipe!
5.0,Made this tonight and the flavour is amazing. I did add extra flour to thicken as well (will probably add more next time perhaps an extra 2T) Also added a couple of sprinkles of watkins apple pie spice. Kids probably would have eaten it all if I had let them. I may reduce the sugar a tad next time but still enjoyed just the same.
5.0,"Wonderful pie, its the only recipe Ill use."
5.0,Loved it and so did everyone that tried it.  Great thank you!
5.0,"I recently went to an apple festival in NC. I had never made a pie before, any pie, and wanted to give it a try. I used honey crisp apples from Grandads Farm and a pie crust recipe from this site. I carefully followed all directions. Absolutely wonderful!"
5.0,"I made this recipe for the first time on Thanksgiving this year. I had read through the reviews and I added 3 tbs of flour to the dry mix. After tossing the apples there was still some mixture left in the bowl, which I proceeded to sprinkle evenly over the apples before placing top crust. It came out great. It was my first time making apple pie myself and this was as easy as can be. I will definitely make this one again. I did not find it too sweet at all, but I will try different apples with it as the Granny Smiths I used were really tart. The sweetness is a matter of taste. Thank you for sharing this recipe."
5.0,"I never made an apple pie before so this was my first attempt.  Everybody loved it!  In fact, I&#39;ve made this 4 times in just 2 weeks."
5.0,"This is the first Applie Pie I have ever made, and I recieved many compliments from it.I did additional flour as the reviews had said.One family member actually said that it tasted just like Grandma&#39;s pies used to.... that is the best compliment anyone could give me! =)I will definatley make it again."
5.0,I cut up the tortillas to layer in pan instead of leaving whole so it is easier to cut or spoon out of dish and I used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream to cut calories
5.0,this pie is very good classic apple pie
5.0,"Apple Pie,Wow!! So yummy. I added 1/2 tsp. of Apple Pie spice to the rest of the ingredients it was great. Thumbs up on this recipe."
5.0,Tasted just like apple pie should. YUMMY.
5.0,Perfect Apple Pie Recipe!  This will stay in my recipe file forever.
5.0,Yum Yum! This pie was very easy to make and very delicious.
5.0,This is sooo good!
5.0,It is a tad bit sweet.. so when I make it next time I will cut down the sugar some. Otherwise it was fantastic!!
5.0,Love this recipe. I used ready made pie crust by Pillsbury. Other than that i stuck to the recipe. It was a big hit with my family. So easy!!
5.0,very good recipe!! very easy to make and tasted wonderful! i also added some caramel syrup to it :) yummmmm
5.0,Family Favorite!
5.0,its awesome but my came out runny even though i followed directions exactly and let it cool for 2 hrs.
5.0,my favorite apple pie recipe.  Sometimes I add a little pumpkin pie spice as well just to spice it up a notch
5.0,This is a great recipe! I added 8 cups of apples and 2 tbls of butter. Next time I would add 1/4 tsp of ground cloves to add a little zest to it. It came out soupy but I let it sit overnight and it was fine. I will be making this again for sure!
5.0,Very good recipe.  Didn&#39;t last long at my house.
5.0,So easy and delicious. We like a bit of heat so I added red pepper flakes to the beef and onions and mixed in some pickled jalapenos slices to the finished mixture before baking to spice it up a bit. Will definitely make it again!
5.0,Very quick to make and quite tasty! Thanks for a great recipe:)
5.0,This was a hit at my house. I used corn tortillas that I fried.  Didn&#39;t add the Italian dressing but did add 5 garlic cloves and 1 jalapeno to the hamburger while cooking. Just the right amount of heat for us.
5.0,Very easy and my husband and son loved it??
5.0,Fabulous and tasty. Easy to make. My kids wanted seconds. Followed the recipe.
5.0,"I thought this was delicious, and my whole family agreed!! I did read the comments before making it, and saw that one suggested using more taco seasoning which I did, and was thrilled with the outcome. I left out the Italian dressing and cilantro, and we were out of tomatoes and lettuce so I did tweak it quite a bit but it ended up amazing. We will definitely be making this again!!"
5.0,"Made this with only 4 low-carb tortillas, ricotta cheese instead of sour cream (had more of that). Added shredded cheese to each individual serving. Used a turkey breakfast sausage for meat- had on hand. Cut calories!!"
5.0,"Big hit in our house! I use corn tortillas and leave out the Italian dressing because it&#39;s not something I keep on hand. Have already made this three times and it&#39;s on the menu again for this weekend, the whole family loves it."
5.0,"Made as written except added hot sauce to beef used whole package of taco seasoning and split between meat and sour cream.  Used extra cheese and put lettuce and tomato on side so everyone could add their own.  Only reason is for reheating left overs.  Was yummy, quick and easy."
5.0,"Everyone liked it, even my picky eater gave it a 4/10 which is pretty good. LOL.  The kind of recipe you can adapt to your tastes and add/subtract things.  I followed the recipe except I used corn tortillas and fried them as others suggested and I found the bottom too hard to cut so follow the instructions and put them in uncooked.  I also added green onion as a garnish."
5.0,Excellent recipe. I used Corn tortillas.
5.0,"This was a perfect recipe for my son to make who is learning to cook.  He did it all himself following the well written directions.  It really was a tasty dish, and the presentation was lovely.  Son was quite proud of himself---even took a picture to email a friend!  I told him he will have to fix it again for Cinco de Mayo!  Thanks for sharing."
5.0,I have made this several times and it never disappoints.  I generally buy the burrito size tortillas since one will fit nicely in the bottom of my round casserole dish.  I then place half the burger mixture on it and layer it with one more tortilla and finish as directed.  So easy and quick to make.
5.0,I loved this recipe!  The flavors are great.  I made this exactly as stated and wouldn&#39;t change a thing!
5.0,"Loved this recipe. Made it for my husband&#39;s poker buddies. They gobbled it up! I did use more sour cream than called for but that only made the dish more creamy. Used a little more Mexican blend cheese than called for. I did add the Italian dressing and didn&#39;t see that it altered the dish adversely.  I will definitely make this dish again. Served shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, guacamole and extra salsa on the side. Also  served a corn salad which was made ahead."
5.0,"I added a diced bull pepper and a half can of rinsed corn and didn’t use cumin or the dressing because of the other reviews where people said it didn’t add to the flavor of the meal, it was awesome! I also used probably three cups of cheese and it was almost quesadilla like, very delicious and different for basically tacos or burritos, my five kids ate every bite!"
5.0,Great recipe! My family loves things cheesy so I added more cheese and sour cream.
5.0,Oh so very good.  The leftovers were even better. I highly recommend.
5.0,"Basically followed original recipe...however we preferred a bit more lettuce, tomato, etc. This is fun because you CAN make little adjustments to your family&#39;s liking and it is still AMAZING! Sorry, but even a little &#34;mushy&#34; I don&#39;t see how it would ruin the taste or make it gross. If it boiled over in your oven, and you used a 11&#34;x7&#34; Pyrex, it is because the recipe calls for an 11&#34;x17&#34;pan. Usually things boil over if your pan is too small OR your oven cooks too hot. My family thought it was great...I thought it was nutritious (hidden!), and we had fun all making it together."
5.0,Oh my goodness this was good. I didn&#39;t have any ground meat but I had leftover brisket and it was perfect!!
5.0,So good! Even my picky eaters loved it!
5.0,What a great recipe! Came together quick and my whole family LOVED it!! Would be a very easy recipe to accommodate to your family&#39;s personal tastes!
5.0,"Great recipe! Everyone loves it and it&#39;s easy to make. I&#39;ve tried the recipe using flour tortillas and with corn tortillas. Both ways are  good, but my family prefers it with the corn tortillas."
5.0,"Super quick and easy family meal! Entire family loves this recipe and it’s even great for leftovers! We prefer the flour tortillas it many have recommended corn if you’re a fan!  I did not add the sour cream as my son and his dad hate it, it still turned out fantastic! Definitely printing out a copy for my recipient books!"
5.0,Great flavor and great texture!  Will definitely make this one again when I want a banana nut bread.  I used pecans instead of walnuts cuz that is what I keep in my freezer.
5.0,"DELICIOUS!!!! I have been on the lookout for a really,really good banana bread recipe and this is it! Super easy and great texture. I didn&#39;t have walnuts but chopped almonds were just as good. You won&#39;t be sorry!"
5.0,This really is the best banana bread I have made.  It is delicious and easy to make.  I&#39;m getting rid of all of my old banana bread recipes.  Thanks.  I tried to give this 5 stars but it didn&#39;t happen.
5.0,such a tastiest banana bread ever......  the best recipe and easy to make. Thanks TOH.
5.0,The best banana bread i ever had....super moist!!!!
5.0,I have tried many banana bread recipes.  This one is just outstanding and the banana flavor is just awesome!
5.0,"I agree, this is a wonderful recipe, the buttermilk makes a big difference.  My recipe is almost 30 years old, and uses a stick of oleo instead of oil, 1/2 cup of buttermilk and only 1 cup sugar. It never fails to please."
5.0,This is the most delicious recipe.  For a change I will add 1 bag of chocolate chips..  I always replace 1/4 cup of sour cream for the buttermilk.  It makes the bread very moist and flavorful.
5.0,"I made this per directions and its title fits the finished product. It is a keeper.  Texture is great, very moist. I used black walnuts, but any nut of choice, or no nuts, would be just as good.  The baking time stated is a bit long for my oven, I would suggest testing before the stated baking time. Mine baked in an hour.  I always remove breads while still warm, not hot, allowing a bread to completely cool sometimes increases sticking.  Cutting a piece of waxed paper the size of the pan bottom eliminates the risk of sticking, although I didn&#39;t do it this time and had no problems."
5.0,I took this bread to my church breakfast and it got rave reviews from everyone.  i had many requests for the recipe  It is  very moist and delicious.
5.0,I used coconut oil and coconut milk and added coconut and cranberries.  The best bread ever!!
5.0,This is the best banana bread recipe! My mom gives me ripe bananas so she can get a loaf
5.0,"There are three people in my house, and this never lasts more than two days. It&#39;s wonderfully moist exactly as it is. I tried to use whole grain once (ONLY once) and it didn&#39;t rise nearly as well and it was a little drier. Also, I wait until the bananas are 4-5 days old and mushy and cut the sugar back by 1/4 cup. It&#39;s still just as sweet and it cuts out a few calories."
5.0,This is for sure the best -ever banana bread!  It disappeared in one sitting ..... thank you for your  recipe Gert.
5.0,We love this bread!!!  With or without nuts it is wonderful.
5.0,I have been making this bread formore than 15 years.  I add a few handfuls of chocolate chips.  It makes a 5 star a 6!
5.0,Faimly and Friends loved it.
5.0,Favorite
5.0,"Halved all ingredients and omitted Italian dressing.  My husband and I loved it, one serving left that we will have to fight over."
5.0,"I completely forgot to put the Italian dressing in, however, it was great.  Easy to make and we will definitely have it again."
5.0,"We LOVE this! I did lightly blend the salsa and onion because the kids don&#39;t like the texture, I mixed the sour cream together with the meat/bean mixture and used more cheese, about 2 cups."
5.0,"Excellent dish!  I&#39;ve made it with (ground) beef, turkey, deer, and today I used elk.  I also make Homemade Tortillas (another Taste of Home recipe) just to make it as healthy as possible.  Thanks for sharing!!!!"
5.0,"Super easy to make, great taste.  Family loved it!!!"
5.0,"Great casserole!  Everybody loves it. We typically make this dish for families with new babies or people who have had surgeries, etc. And we always get asked for the recipe. It&#39;s delicious!"
5.0,Left out the Italian dressing. Used corn tortillas. Did not use enough. I only made one layer of torn tortillas. Next time I would use more. Since I suspected there weren&#39;t enough I sprayed tortillas and baked them the last 5 minutes of the casserole so we had chips. I added refried beans along with the black beans and stirred in Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I also used ground turkey instead of beef. We loved it.
5.0,"Wow! Quick and easy, and so good! I thought the Italian dressing was an odd addition, but I think it adds to the flavor. I did, however, leave out the black beans (picky kids.)"
5.0,"I made this for a neighborhood get-together, and it was a big hit. I will definitely make it again!  I had 8 tortillas, so I made a third layer. I also had ground Elk, and used it instead of beef. It has very little fat. I used 2 cups of cheese. Thanks for sharing."
5.0,i used a can of Mexican stewed tomatoes instead of salsa and added a can of corn and some diced jalapenos.  It was delicious!   New favorite!
5.0,This is an excellent recipe.  I substituted ground turkey for the ground beef and I used hot taco seasoning mix.  My family loved it!
5.0,Quick and delicious
5.0,Excellent!!
5.0,My family loved it!
5.0,Love this casserole. I add a layer of refried beans and jalapenos. Very good!!
5.0,"We really liked this dish.  I used corn tortillas instead of the flour.  For the beef mixture, I used refried beans instead of the black beans, and also added green chiles and corn.  I didn&#39;t have Mexican cheese, so I used sharp cheddar.  This is a very versatile recipe, so using the suggestions of others worked well.  I will definitely make this again.   Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
5.0,my kids love this recipe . It&#39;s a huge hit at our dinner table.
5.0,WeweeWe
5.0,This is an awesome recipe. Quick and easy. Cilantro sets it off! Thanks!
5.0,"!I have to tell you that the first time I made this was in Mexico. My Mexican friends loved it!!!Deveras. If you are finding the bottom too crisp then spread a little salsa in the bottom of your pan first. I always make it in a round casserole pan that accommodates the size of the tortillas I use. IF there is anything leftover, the taste is even better the next day for lunch. I serve with hot salsa on the side to accommodate all tastes"
5.0,"Instead of the black beans, I used refriedBeans and layered each tortilla.Almost like a Mexican lasagna."
5.0,EXCELLENT AND EASY TO MAKE!  I thought the 400 degree oven temp excessive so I baked at 350 degrees for the specified time.   Also spread a little salsa on bottom of casserole dish.  No burning or crisp tortillas.  This dish is definitely a &#34;keeper&#34; .  Next time I will kick it up a little by adding some green chiles and/or chipotle chiles in adobe to mix.
5.0,Delicious! I left out the dressing because I didn&#39;t have any. I took this to a ladies&#39; dinner at church and didn&#39;t bring home a single bite! Everyone raved about it! I added a little salsa to the bottom and mixed the sour cream in the meat mixture as others recommended. Easy and delicious! I can&#39;t wait to make it again!
5.0,We really liked this recipe. Easy and delicious!
5.0,"A hit with the family!  Hubby, I and 12 year old and 4 year old.  Needs to be doubled as the four of us ate the entire dinner in one sitting with only one helping of leftovers left, which the children fought over for lunch the next day.  Super simple to make, too!"
5.0,Wonderful Delight!!
5.0,I didn&#39;t make any adjustments. I love it and friends and family love it just as it is.
5.0,i take this to potlucks and everyone loves it .  I use black bean and corn salsa.  Just wonder how long to cook it in a crock pot?
5.0,My family and I really enjoyed this meal. It was easy to prepare and I will definitely serve it again.
5.0,Excellent!  I omitted the sour cream &amp; Italian dressing because my husband isn&#39;t a fan of those foods.  It still came out moist &amp; tasty.  This will certainly be a repeat dish.  Jalapeno&#39;s would be a good addition for extra kick too.
5.0,New family favorite!
5.0,"This is by far the best banana bread ever!  I have made this for farmers market and it sold out right away each time.  Moist, flavorful and wonderful taste.  I will never use another recipe for banana bread!"
5.0,"Best banana bread. Made it for my office. Did not think that the men would notice that I left out the walnuts. Believe me, the men sure did tell me the next time I made the bread I&#39;m to add the walnuts."
5.0,Doubled the recipe and it came out very well. The best banana cake ever. Thank you!

5.0,I just made this banana bread and it is delicious! My honey likes a warm slice with butter on it. He kept asking for a piece before it cooled off. I will be making this bread over and over again.
5.0,"I&#39;ve made this recipe several times and it is EXCELLENT! On the 3rd morning after making it we had 4 slices left and I used them to make Banana Nut French Toast! Topped with powdered sugar and if you like, syrup! I also do this with carrot nut bread!! Give it a try!"
5.0,I thought this was very good and even better with a tsp of cinnamon added. will definitely make again.
5.0,My 2-1/2 year old granddaughter and I made this bread today (she loves dumping in the ingredients after I measure ). It was easy and moist and delicious. Made as directed except added some cinnamon.  It made 4 mini loaves and baked for 35 minutes.
5.0,Very good.  Cut back on the sugar to 1 cup.
5.0,"After 30yrs. of using the same banana bread recipe I&#39;ve switched to this recipe.  My daughters agree with me.  This is the &#34;Best-Ever Banana Bread&#34;.   Except for adding a teaspoon of banana flavoring we followed the recipe exactly.It was so quick &amp; easy, I didn&#39;t even need the mixer.  Only a measuring cup, bowl &amp; wisk."
5.0,"Not only did I cut the sugar back to a cup, I also replaced 3/4 cup of the white flour with whole wheat  flour and it still turned out wonderful!"
5.0,"This is one of the best.  I cut back on the sugar to one cup.  I did not have buttermilk so I used milk mixed with some lemon juice.  I used pecans since I did not have walnuts.  It was easy to prepare and came out perfect after 1 hour, 15 min.  Will make this again soon. This one did not last long."
5.0,The BEST!
5.0,Super quick and easy and my family LOVES this recipe! I use ground turkey in stead of beef.  The only other change I made was stirring the sour cream into the sauce mix after removing from heat.  This recipe is a real keeper!
5.0,My family loves this recipe. I use ground turkey and add the sour cream to the mixture. I also add a can a corn.   5 stars!!
5.0,Great easy to make very good - love this recipe!
5.0,Made this tonight and it was delicious.  Very simple to make.  Will be making again in the near future.
5.0,I just made this dish tonight and WOW....this is a keeper! Like others I also added the sour cream in the meat mixture.
5.0,"This was the entree for tonight&#39;s dinner and it was well received! I left out the Italian dressing as I&#39;m not a fan of it anyway, but it was excellent! I put the recipe in my &#34;favorite&#34; recipe box too. What do you think of tearing the tortillas in pieces instead of placing 3 down and 3 layered with the meat mixture?"
5.0,"Wonderful recipe, easy to make  and something different!."
5.0,Recipe was wonderful. Family loved and they are tough critics!!!!
5.0,Wonderful recipe....this is a keeper...will make this again and again.
5.0,Very good and tasty. Will be making this again soon!
5.0,"Good recipe, will make it again. Love the cilantro, and I also mashed half of the beans and added a little more sour cream."
5.0,"great recipe, wonderful flavor, going to try with ground turkey next time for fewer calories"
5.0,Definitely went back for seconds!
5.0,Everyone in our family loves this recipe and it has been become a regular for us. I have made is per the recipe and also made a version where I changed the sour cream for Non-fat plain greek yogurt and it tastes the same. LOVE this!
5.0,My kids loved this! I added the sour cream to the meat mixture to save time and to make sure the sour cream was evenly distributed.
5.0,This is easy and my husband said it is very good.  I will definitely make it again.
5.0,Very tasty recipe. I love the southwestern taste so what &#39;s not to love about this recipe. Made as written with the exception I did not have any fresh cilantro so I used dried.
5.0,"I used corn tortillas and turkey.  Top with guacamole.  R new family favorite. Quick, Easy &amp; Healthy"
5.0,"Made this for dinner last night. Huge hit!! Actually made it for DH, I&#39;m not a big fan of Mexican food and guess what, I went back for seconds!!! Awesome! Only thing I did different was added a can of chopped green chilies to the meat mixture. We like spicy. DH said next time he wanted guacamole with it. I agreed. Thanks for posting!"
5.0,Used turkey and only 4 tortillas.  Wonderful!
5.0,Great flavor. We&#39;ll be adding fresh jalapeno to the toppings next time for a little more kick!
5.0,Making this recipe again tonight and can&#39;t wait!  It is SO easy and SO amazing!!  LOVE IT
5.0,Love it and very easy to make.
5.0,Loved it! Subbed pepper jack cheese for mexican blend. Super simple to throw together. A bit messy but who cares...it tastes great!
5.0,"I had ground beef I had to use last night and decided to make this for dinner.  I usually don&#39;t have high hopes for casserole type dishes, but this turned out to be OUTSTANDING.  My husband said it&#39;s one of the best things I&#39;ve ever made.  It&#39;s on the dinner rotation now.  Thank you so much!"
5.0,My family loves this recipe!!! I make this all the time.  A real keeper!
5.0,Yummy...easy. Perfect as is
5.0,"This is a wonderful recipe!  I do substitute corn tortillas instead of flour, but that is just our preference.  I love that this is a healthier version of other enchilada recipes I have.  Everyone in our family loves it!"
5.0,"This was so good, everyone at the table was making yummy noises! Adults, kids and toddlers all gobbled it up and went back for seconds- I didn&#39;t have any leftovers! Will make this again for sure!"
5.0,AMAZING!!!! My family loved it! I have forwarded this recipe on the about 10 other people as well! Definitely a keeper and will be making this alot! Thanks for sharing!
5.0,"I had decided to try this meal out since there were a considerable amount of good ratings, and boy am I glad I did! It is delicious! My family scarfed it down, there were no leftovers, and the price was descent. Definitely will be added to our &#34;family favorites&#34; list."
5.0,My family really liked it. For a 4 and a 5 year old it was perfect!
5.0,This was excellent and so easy... would make it for company or potluck!
5.0,This was a winner with my family...everyone loved it.  I didn&#39;t include the Italian dressing just because I didn&#39;t have any on hand.  Still very good.
5.0,"As soon as I saw this on the cover of the magazine, I knew I was going to try this.  My whole family loved it.  It is also very easy to make.  I have made it several times.  Always make as written."
5.0,Was impressed with this dish.  We have added it to our list of &#34;keepers&#34;!
5.0,This was so tasty that we ate it until all of the leftovers were gone!!  I tried it with the cilantro for the first night but it was too overpowering so left it and the italian dressing off and it was sooo tasty!!  Making it again tonight!!
5.0,This was AWESOME!!!!!! Will definitely make again.
5.0,"I have made this many times for all types of people &amp; I have never had anyone not love it. It&#39;s a regular part of of the menu when my husband &amp; I cook Mexican for corporate events, &amp; my husband IS Mexican! It is my teenage daughter&#39;s top request."
5.0,"I made this according to the recipe and we all loved it.  However, the tortillas wouldn&#39;t fit in a 2 quart casserole so I used a 9 x 13.  The next time I think I&#39;ll try corn tortillas as we like that flavor in our Mexican meals."
5.0,"I&#39;ve recommended this to several friends and colleagues, and made it for my family many time.... EVERYONE LOVES IT!!!  This deserves more than five stars!"
5.0,My whole family loved this!
5.0,"Excellent dish and so easy! modifications: I used corn tortillas, covered bottom of casserole w/salsa, used kidney beans,mixed sour cream into meat mixture but also added cream cheese since I didn&#39;t have enough sour cream.  The results?  No left overs!  Three teens and a picky 11year old all devoured it.  My youngest doesn&#39;t even like casseroles, Mexican and beans; however, she loved this dish.  Will make this a family recipe keeper!  Thank you!"
5.0,Tried this tonight and really enjoyed it.  My husband loved it!  I&#39;m a little hard to please but I followed the recipe exactly (except I added a layer of salsa to the bottom before I put down the torillas to prevent the dryness everyone was talking about as well as leaving out the onion because I don&#39;t like onion and felt the salsa would have plenty) and it turned out delicious.  It went together so easily and I will definitely make this again.
5.0,Dont pay attention to any bad review of this recipe.  It is yummy and quick to make.  Mine looked just like the pic above:)  It was delicious!
5.0,This is a great recipe! My husband loves having this for dinner. My only change was leaving out the Italian dressing - I did not have any on hand.
5.0,So yummy!
5.0,"I made this exactly as is written with the exception of the taco seasoning. I used a Fiesta Dip mix (1 T, not 2 as directed) from Tastefully Simple. Otherwise exactly as written and this is amazing. My grown children were home fro supper and want the recipe and took the leftover home with them. Served a salad in a small tortilla shell baked into a bowl and some spanish rice. Beautiful dinner, good enough to be served to anyone!"
5.0,Very tasty banana bread.  I cut the sugar down to less than one cup.  I will definitely make this again.
5.0,I have made banana bread over the years and this is the best recipe I have ever tried.  I need not look further.  This is it!
5.0,"I tried 2 different recipes..I bought bananas and totally FORGOT i had them, so i had a bunch, and figured I could freeze some of the bread. This recipe is GREAT!!  Another time i will use an extra banana and do half white sugar half brown. The other recipe I tried had all brown sugar and was also wonderful, but I&#39;m thinking a mix of the 2 might be JUST right!!I always try a recipe as printed before making changes...so glad I did with this one!!"
5.0,"This is really a great recipe. I know that all our ovens bake differently, but if you check your bread at the one hour mark, then 5 minute intervals after that, this bread won&#39;t over cook. At one hour it&#39;s still really wet inside, but it firms up really fast after that. Mine was done at 1 hour 10 minutes and was perfect. I hope that helps"
5.0,"I have used a recipe very similar to this one since 1966.  Mine uses 1 stick of margarine instead of oil, only 1 cup of sugar, 3 mashed bananas not 2 and no buttermilk or vanilla plus I&#39;ve always used pecans and not walnuts but that is a matter of preference.  Instead of bread, I often make miniature muffins and we love the muffins."
5.0,I followed the directions exactly except for adding 1 cup of Hershey cinnamon chips along with the walnuts.  Came out AMAZING.
5.0,Excellent recipe.   I skipped the nuts because I didn&#39;t have any and it still turned out tasty.   Next time I will make sure I have walnuts because I&#39;m sure it will be even better.    I read the reviews and decided to use only 1 cup of sugar and added a teaspoon of cinnamon.   This is now my go to banana bread recipe.  Very fast and easy.
5.0,"I make this any time I have bananas that are really ripe, it&#39;s really good!"
5.0,"This is the best banana bread ever! It never turned out so good before. I like it because it’s fluffy and the bananas weren’t as good to eat anymore but when I baked it, it turned out delicious. I give it 5 stars."
5.0,Love this recipe
5.0,Absolutely amazing!! I always make mini loafs to share the deliciousness :) thank you for sharing!
5.0,Best of all my banana bread recipes.
5.0,Next time I will try only one cup sugar.  I didn&#39;t have any buttermilk so added 1/2 tsp of cream of tartar to the milk.  The only other change I made was using Saffola instead of canola.  My grandson suggests adding chocolate chips next time as he likes them in everything.  Really good and very moist.
5.0,"While I am not a huge fan of just plain banana bread, I must say this one is good.  I did add cinnamon to the batter because my family loves  it.  I didn&#39;t add any nuts because DD doesn&#39;t like them; however, I would add pecans if I were making this to give away.  Husband and I prefer pecans, but that is just a preference thing.  Will definitely make again."
5.0,"Great recipe, but way too much sugar for our liking.  I made a double batch this time and used 1c. Sugar toral.  I always add cinnamon with a sprinkle of nutmeg.  I dont ever have buttermilk so i always use milk and vinegar with great results.  Made 1 loaf pan and 2 mini loaves; minis took about 50 mins, large took 1 hr 15 mins.  Delish!!"
5.0,"This was delicious! My husband loved it. I didn&#39;t have black beans, so I used kidney beans which were very tasty. Would definitely make this again!"
5.0,This was very good and hubby agreed! I&#39;m making it again next week.
5.0,"This was FANTASTIC! EVERYONE (that&#39;s me, my husband, and 5 picky kids) ALL loved it! It was easy to make and came together quickly. I did add sliced olives to the lettuce topping, and I used regular cheddar cheese. Other than that, I followed the directions exactly and it was GREAT! Thanks for a great recipe!"
5.0,Family loved this and have requested it again! Very easy and yummy!
5.0,"We didn&#39;t know what to make for dinner last night and discovered we had all the ingredients for this so we tried it. It was a little too spicy for our 8 y/o, but still a definite &#34;keeper&#34;. This may be my husband&#39;s new favorite diabetic friendly recipe!"
5.0,"My family LOVED this! I did make some changes and additions... Instead of salsa, I used Rotel, instead of flour tortillas, I used tortilla chips and I also added refried beans. This was fantastic and a definite keeper! Thanks!"
5.0,"My husband absolutely loved this!!! It&#39;s so easy and has wonderful flavor. Plus, it serves so many or leaves lots of leftovers :)"
5.0,Fantastic!  I used nonfat plain Greek yogurt.  Very YUMMY!  Kids love this.
5.0,My husband and I loved this recipe.  The only thing I changed was using corn torillas instead of flour.  Very very good.
5.0,"This recipe is amazing and I will definitly be making it again.  My kids liked it, too, but it was a little spicy for them, so I think I would lessen the taco seasoning next time.  I also think it looks funky with the sour cream baked in it, so I think I would leave that for a topping after it is done."
5.0,Even my very picky 6yr old son liked it!
5.0,I make this often for new moms who just had babies. It&#39;s a nice change from the usual fare for them. Warning--this can be pretty spicy so I have toned it down esp for nursing moms by using mild taco seasoning and mild salsa.  :o)  It&#39;s always a hit.  And it&#39;s easy too!
5.0,Very yummy!  I did not use the dressing and subbed out the sour cream for cottage cheese.  I used the sour cream for a topper instead.  Will definately be making this one again!
5.0,the family loved it. Will make again.
5.0,This recipe is one of my family&#39;s favorites! Wheat tortillas work great too and make the dish even healthier.
5.0,Everyone I serve this to loves it.
5.0,The entire family loved this..It is AWESOME..will be making again very soon
5.0,My husband and I loved this easy and hearty casserole.
5.0,"Love it!!  Yummy and easy to put together. The tortillas are the first part of the layer, in aswering dvilands question.  What tortillas is your preference.  I myself dont care for corn tortillas at all and use flour, wheat tortillas are good to."
5.0,My picky eater devoured this casserole. He complained about being too full! It is on my list of make agains. It is very easy!
5.0,This recipe is a family favorite. Even my picky 17yr old nephew loves it.  I have made it several times.  The Italain dressing is a great addition.  There are never any leftovers.  It is also quick and easy.
5.0,"Awesome meal, will definitely make it again. The only thing I did differently was use burrito seasoning instead of taco."
5.0,Great and super easy recipe.  We are going to try it with shredded cooked chicken next time.  Thanks for sharing!
5.0,"My husband &#34;hates&#34; casseroles (or so he thinks), but I had to try this recipe because to me it sounded wonderful.  He absolutely loved it.  It&#39;s been less than a week and he&#39;s wanting to know when I&#39;m preparing it again!  My only differences from the recipe--I only keep whole grain tortillas on hand, but they worked great.  And I forgot to pick up fresh tomatoes, so topped it with salsa.  And for anyone considering leaving off the lettuce--DON&#39;T!  Some crisp shredded romaine topped it off perfectly!!  My husband ate 3 of the 8 servings that night at dinner.  Perfect recipe!!!"
5.0,Easy enough to do and very tasty!
5.0,Great flavor and easy to make.  My whole family loves it.....
5.0,"I am vegetarian and made this with textured vegetable protein. It turned out great and was delicious! The husband ate it and until I told him there was no meat in it, he didn&#39;t even realize."
5.0,switched the beef out for ground turkey - it was amazing.
5.0,Very tasty.  I added corn and some ranch dressing.
5.0,My husband and I love this recipe.  Easy to make and very tasty!
5.0,I add green chilies and mash 1/2 of the black beans and leave the rest whole. I also use corn tortillas and fry them in olive oil before layering to add texture to the dish.
5.0,Super easy and tastes incredible!!  I will be making this dish often!
5.0,"This was great, my kids loved too!"
5.0,This is easy to prepare and very tasty.
5.0,This was fabulous!  My family gobbled it up so quickly.  Will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!
5.0,"This was a quick and easy recipe, and it was deliscious.  We will definitely make this one again."
5.0,"My husband and I love this dish, it&#39;s not to hard to make and I follow the instructions as is except that I call it Mexican pizza instead. I cut it out like pizza slices and the taste is amazing!"
5.0,"very good, everyone liked it"
5.0,"Great recipe. I didn&#39;t have buttermilk so I used my unsweetened coconut milk, and didn&#39;t have canola oil so I used olive oil unsure of how it would turn out and everyone loved it! Next time I think I will do 1/4 c less sugar as it is plenty sweet. This is the one I will use from now on. It took 1 hr 25 min."
5.0,Best ever!!
5.0,My go to recipe for banana bread. Excellent as written. I have double it and used a tube cake pan for easier presentation. Over time I have left out the nuts and added 1 tsp  Cinnamon for our household preference.
5.0,We just love this bread.
5.0,"We love this recipe! It is the only banana bread recipe I use. I have a nut allergy so I never add the walnuts, but sometimes I add chocolate chips, sometimes I add 1/4 cup cocoa and chocolate chips,  sometimes I add fresh blueberries, sometimes I don&#39;t add anything. No matter how it is made it turns out great! Sometimes I even make them as muffins! Such a great recipe!"
5.0,"I made this yesterday, it&#39;s gone today. It definitely has the right name. It was absolutely THE BEST BANANA BREAD EVER. The second time I made it today I changed one thing, I halved the amount of nuts and added dark chocolate chips for the other half. It also was exceptionally delicious. The original recipe is so moist and light, not oily and mushy like a lot of recipes. Thank you so much for another of your recipes. All I have tried have become big hits with my family."
5.0,"I have been on the hunt for a good banana bread recipe. My husband has hated every recipe I have made and only likes his grandmas. I got his grandmas recipe and made it. And guess what? Did it turn out like grandmas? No. I tried this recipe last night. I used 3/4 of the all mixed, finished batter and put hat into a  loaf pan. The remainder of the mix was used for mini muffins. I did this because my sister said that every banana bread recipe is actually meant for 2 loafs. This recipe did not say to divide this into two loaf pans. But my sister swore by this. No the bread did not need to bake the total amount of time that was asked. This was due to not putting the whole batch in one pan. I sincerely believe that not using the whole batch in one pan is what helped this stay nice and flavorful and slightly moist. Most breads come out too dry when I use the whole batch in one pan and cook for recommended time. My sister was right. Thanks sis! The bread did turn out looking a little darker although that did not change the taste of this AMAZING recipe. I kept a eye on the bread after a half hour and did the tooth pick trick to see when my bread was done. Finally I have a banana bread recipe I will be excited to add to our family favs cook book!"
5.0,One of the best recipes I&#39;ve tried. Bread was moist.  Kids and nephews ate it all up.   Will definitely be making this again.If you&#39;re going to be making mini loaves like I did you&#39;ll need to set your timer to 30 minutes instead of1 hour.
5.0,"BEST. BANANA. BREAD. *EVER*!!!I&#39;ve been using this recipe for five years now (or more!)… But never actually submitted a review! And the very first time I made it I fell in love! I&#39;m very picky with my banana breads (True story!).  This is ALWAYS my GO-TO recipe to give away as treats to family/friends or to make and keep at home (but it doesn&#39;t last very long!). I&#39;ve made it exactly the way it shows in the recipe. And it&#39;s AMAZING!! However… Being the curious and advanced chef/baker that I am,  I changed a few ingredients to &#34;health&#34; it up a bit.  You&#39;re welcome to adopt my style! Here&#39;s what I did:Used 1 cup unbleached flour and 3/4 cup whole wheat( i&#39;ve also used gluten free flour blend and it works just as well )Used 1/2 cup white or raw organic sugar, 1/2 cup brownUsed 1/2 cup avocado oil instead of veg or canola (no taste diff and SO MUCH healthier!)Made my own buttermilk (1/2 cup milk with 1/2 tablespoon vinegar. Stir and  Let sit 5 mins. Discard a bit to give just over 1/4 cup.Mix well. Stir in mini chocolate chips (or 60% dark chunks) and poof!! Magic!  An unbelievable, healthy and DELICIOUS banana bread!!!  I bake at 325F for 65 mins everytimeBon Appetite!!"
5.0,"This was very good.  I omit the nuts, but it really had nice flavor.  I reduced the cook time by about 10 minutes, I did the toothpick test on my smaller loaf pan just in case, then decided to check the larger as well, they were both done."
5.0,Wonderful!
5.0,"The taste and texture of this banana bread is perfect and my family loved it.  My personal preference is for the top crust to not be as dark.  I couldn&#39;t get the bread to cook all the way through without the top getting a dark brown.  (I made 2 loaves and put a piece of foil over one of them and it still turned out a dark brown.)  As I said, that is my personal preference."
5.0,This is my favorite banana bread recipe.  It always comes out perfect.
5.0,"My husband is pretty picky but said that he would want me to make it again.  I used 1/2 pepperjack cheese and 1/2 med  salsa, 1/2 mild.  It was terrific.   Easy and delicious!"

5.0,"My family loves this bread.  Sometimes I replace the walnuts with pecans or mini chocolate chips but otherwise, make it according to the recipe."
5.0,"I love this recipe! It is easy to mix together, and the end result tastes great. I like to wrap the cooled loaf in foil and let it sit overnight prior to serving/eating, as this makes it much more most. This banana bread is so good!"
5.0,Perfect!
5.0,It is the best recipie ever. I even used 3 old frozen runny bananas and it was delicious!
5.0,"I live at 7200 ft and didn&#39;t modify (other than swapping pecans for walnuts out of preference), and it turned out great for anyone else at high altitude who might be wondering. Only cooked it for about 1 hr;10 min.  Delicious! I was concerned about the top getting too dark as one commenter stated as that often happens to me with baking, but it was right in the center of my oven and came out perfectly browned."
5.0,My husband loves this Banana Bread.  I often substitute chocolate chips for the walnuts and serve it as a dessert.
5.0,The name says it all!  Second to none in my book.  Delicious!
5.0,Fantastic old fashion recipe! I did decrease the sugar to 1 cup as to make it healthier...and could not tell the difference. Just like Grandmas!!
5.0,I made it for my clients and they asked for it again and again.  So tonight  I&#39;m making it again
5.0,This is the best banana nut bread that I have ever eaten.
5.0,"I&#39;ve tried a lot of banana bread recipes, and this really is the best ever!"
5.0,"I just made this today. From a previous reviewer, I also cut the sugar down to 1 cup and this is the best banana nut bread I made. This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing."
5.0,This was great!! When I crave mexican this is what I want! My family couldn&#39;t get enough of it! I can&#39;t wait to make it again!

5.0,Oh my goodness this is so good and super easy!  The change I did make was not in ingredient but in preparation.  I mixed the salsa and sourcream together which made it much easier to layer than sourcream by itself.  Will definitely make again!

5.0,"Loved this recipe!  Even though I found it in the Comfort Food Diet magazine, it still seemed a little heavy.  I made some substitutions.  I used 93% lean ground turkey instead of 90%  ground beef + used the entire 1.25 lb package instead of the 1 lb of ground beef called for in the recipe since I didn&#39;t want to freeze the extra 1/4 lb by itself.    I don’t like Italian dressing so used 1/3 cup v-8 juice instead of ¼ c It dressing.  Next time I will boost it to 1/2 or 2/3 c if I use the extra gr. turkey again.   Cut the number of flour tortillas to 2 per layer instead of 3.  Results in 8 WW points plus for 8 servings."

5.0,I have made this a couple of times and the entire family loves it. I did take the advice of spreading some salsa on the bottom of the dish before the tortillas and it worked out much better!

5.0,This is one of my husband&#39;s favorite meals and mine also because it is so easy to make! I leave out the cumin (because I do not care for the flavor) but otherwise I follow the recipe exactly. We eat this for lunch and dinner multiple days in a row because it is so good!!

5.0,"I loved this! I had three bananas I needed to use up, so I replaced the canola oil with another banana. It came out so moist and delicious!"
5.0,"OK, I&#39;ll admit, I *HATE* it when someone submits a review and is either challenging the authenticity based on the recipe name versus the ingredients used, or has NOT even MADE the recipe, or has made it and says &#34;but I made changes&#34;... so what am I about to do??? LOL  I am going to tell you that I *LOVE* this recipe, although the version that I was given does NOT use the buttermilk, walnuts or vanilla, uses 1/2 tsp baking soda, 2 tsp baking powder. and reduces the sugar to 3/4 cup, all else is the same (I *know*, it&#39;s NOT THE SAME, right!?!?!).  I *do* love nuts in my banana bread, and I *have* added them in the past.  The buttermilk, however, adds a dairy product that my wife doesn&#39;t tolerate well (lactose intolerant),  So for those of you looking for a non-dairy version, I suspect you can omit the buttermilk from this recipe and still have an awesome result."
5.0,My absolute favorite recipe!    I add extra bananas if I have them and keeps it extra moist.     I also use powdered buttermilk to make the 1/4 cup buttermilk  so I always have buttermilk available in my kitchen.   Highly recommend this recipe!
5.0,My family loves this recipe.  Ask for it regularly.
5.0,I have made this several times and everyone who has eaten this says &#34;This is the best banana bread they have ever eaten&#34;! If I don&#39;t have buttermilk I will use milk with about a TB of vinegar and it still has been great. This is very moist and delicious.
5.0,"Emily, Thank you for adding your comment of using 3 bananas &amp; not adding the oil,  This is great!, less calories. There is added value when  adjustments are made to the recipe.  This helps to cut down on calories or use substitutes. Very much appreciated."
5.0,"Very good recipe, but on the sugar, I used 3/4 brown sugar and 3/4 regular white sugar. I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon."
5.0,"I have made this Banana bread more times than I can count! It&#39;s the only recipe I use and as my husband is a Diabetic, I make it with 1 cup of Splenda. It is plenty sweet and delicious, besides the walnuts I sometimes add Craisins."
5.0,"Our family loves this recipe so much that I keep the right amount of buttermilk frozen in baggies just so I will have it on hand when our bananas get a little too ripe and I make this bread. My grandson suddenly stopped eating bananas and as it turned out, he was letting them get &#34;too old&#34; so we would have banana bread!"
5.0,"I really wanted some banana bread, but did not have a &#34;Go to&#34; recipe.  I trust Taste of Home so I came here to look for one.  This one rocks!  Easy recipe with basic ingredients.  Turned out great.  It&#39;s a keeper!"
5.0,"My grandson (he’s 5) and I LOVE this recipe.  He loves that we have a DRY bowl AND a WET bowl.  Sometimes when our bananas aren’t “rotten” enough, we will pick up some organic banana baby food.  Works great!  He calls it our Banana Buck Bread.  We like pecans as our “Bucks”  instead of walnuts."
5.0,"Loved it! I used 1/2 chunky mango habanero salsa, and 1/2 standard hot, and the texture was great, not runny at all. I usually make my own taco seasoning, and just mixed in some chile powder, cumin, oregano, cayenne, salt/pepper, and fresh garlic. I also added minced serrano pepper. I did make a couple minor substitutions: shallots instead of onion, and monterey jack instead of mexican cheese. The only problem was I ate way too much.I think next time I&#39;ll try corn tortillas and maybe add a can of corn."

5.0,"Sorry, but I didn&#39;t use any fat free stuff.  Browned beef and onion, drained.  Added 1 packet taco season, cumin, salsa, salad dressing and kidney beans (we don&#39;t like black beans).  Heated in skillet and served meat mixture over crushed tortilla chips.  Added cheese, lettuce, tomatoe, raw onion and sour cream on top of each serving.  Great recipe!  We had to force ourselves to stop eating!"

5.0,Very good!  My whole family loved it and told me repeatedly that I will need to make this again.  I did put 3/4 c of the salsa on the bottom of the pan as was suggested and I also stirred in the sour cream with the meat and beans.  I loved how easy it was to serve (not having to add salsa or sour cream on the plate).

5.0,"This recipe is fast, easy and delicious! I also used less sugar and oil than specified along with extra banana and milk. I also used half brown sugar instead of all white and I added some cinnamon and allspice. I LOVE the idea of putting some of the nuts on top before baking (I&#39;ll be sure to do that next time). Also, I made 12 muffins and that baking time was about 35-40 min. YUMMY!!"
5.0,"I&#39;ve been making this recipe for years!  I found it in a church cookbook.  I&#39;m now famous for this recipe among my family, friends and coworkers.  It&#39;s so moist, unlike most banana bread recipes.  Yes, it comes out dark.  It has sort of chewy crust that everyone loves.  I can&#39;t say enough about this recipe.  It&#39;s absolutely the best!!"
5.0,"Omitted the walnuts due to allergies. Sprinkled turbinado sugar on top before baking.  It disappeared fast, definitely will double the recipe next time!"
5.0,Whenever I have extra bananas this is the recipe I reach for to make banana nut bread. In fact I have shared it 5 times with different friends; it&#39;s that good.
5.0,This is definitely the best banana bread I&#39;ve ever tasted.  My whole family loves it.
5.0,I will never look for another banana bread recipe!  This one completely lives up to its name!
5.0,"This is my favorite banana bread recipe, I think my family lets the bananas turn brown so I will make this.  LOL  The only thing I do is dust the pans(I always double it, and put 1 loaf in the freezer) with cinnamon &amp; sugar. YUMMMMMMMY"
5.0,This turned out wonderfully. I used bananas that were black to get a great banana flavor.I think I may try less sugar next time. perhaps  1 cup.
5.0,"It’s in the oven now. Sure smells good baking!  I checked at one hour and was still gooey in center. Checked again in 5 minutes (as suggested by another reviewer) and it was done!  I had lined  the loaf pan with parchment paper, so I cooled for 10 minutes and lifted it out to finish cooling. Smells and looks delicious! My whole house smells like bananas!"
5.0,"A really, really good recipe. I don’t usually tried recipes that are labeled “best ever”, but I had the ingredients for this one. The bread is moist, is has the right texture and strong banana flavor. A definnite winner. I used a scant cup on the oil simply because I ran out and it was still very moist."
5.0,"I have a similar recipe. Use 1 cup sugar, 3/4 cup oil and bake in 3 smaller pans which are great as gifts or to keep in the freezer. I spray the bottom of the three pans and sprinkle with oatmeal to keep from sticking. Bake at 335 degrees for 35-36 minutes. my husband likes blueberries rather then nuts.So good, hard to keep them on hand."
5.0,I have been making this bread for many years. I double the recipe and do two 9x5 loaf pans.  I always start my timer for 45 minutes and then start checking the bread after that for doneness.  It truly is the best ever banana bread.
5.0,"This is AMAZING! I made a few adjustments, based on other reviews, and can’t believe that everyone in my family likes it! Even my daughter who said, “Eww, banana bread??” Lol! She loved it!My adjustments:I substituted 1/4 of the white sugar with brown sugar, used 2 1/2 bananas and reduced oil to 1/4 cup, used 1 tsp vanilla paste for the vanilla, added 1 tsp cinnamon and a tiny pinch of ginger and nutmeg. It does take quite awhile to bake, but be patient. It’s totally worth it!!!"
5.0,First time I made it for my picky family they all loved it!! Simple to make.  Highly recommend.

Since I like a little more spice to my food I added some hot sauce to my serving, but wouldn&#39;t add it to the entire dish...again, I have picky eaters."

The tortillas weren&#39;t hard at the bottom, and it had just the right mix of cumin and italian dressing.  Really great flavors.  Even my 1 year old liked it and I wasn&#39;t sure if he would because it&#39;s pretty spicy!"

5.0,"This is a great recipe for all ages! The only change I made was to use an 8 oz bottle of mild picante sauce instead of the salsa. (My kids don&#39;t like the &#34;chunks&#34;) I spread a little sauce on the bottom of the pan before placing the tortillas.  This prevented sticking and hardness mentioned by others, and also kept the casserole from being runny. I will definitely make again!"

Didn&#39;t add the sour cream in(kids are not fans  of sour cream), but I added on top with the lettuce and tomatoes for myself. Great Dish!! "
5.0,Very delicious and easy to make. Will for sure make again and again and again...
5.0,Very delicious and easy to make. Will for sure make again and again and again...
5.0,I didn&#39;t have Italian dressing so I used the Red Wine Vinaigrette that I had. Put a whole pack to taco seasoning. Substituted the black beans with corn. Hubby don&#39;t like sour cream so I added it to mine at the end. Very good. Will definitely make it again. 
5.0,"Wow, that was incredible!  My kids absolutely loved it!  It was all gone in a flash!  I used a little bit of salsa to put on the bottom of the dish to prevent the bottom tortillas from getting too hard like some reviews had said.  It worked fantastic.  Just a small layer to coat/cover dish.  Also I mixed the sour cream in the meat/bean mixture instead of layering it because my kids don&#39;t like sour cream unless it is mixed in things.  They loved it!  We used Tostitos mild chunky salsa &amp; Kraft zesty Italian dressing.  This is a family favorite now!!"

5.0,Just made this again &amp; WoW it is fantastic!  I did some modifications this time to try some new things out.  This recipe is great as is but the additions were nice &amp; changed it up a little.  I added 1 C. frozen corn to the meat/onions in the pan.  I added 4 cloves garlic chopped to the pan towards the end of cooking.  I used 2 C. Tostitos Mild Chunky Salsa (used a small amount to coat bottom of baking dish to prevent sticking which worked great).  I used 2 cans black beans.  Used 1 C. lite sour cream which I added to the meat mixture once it was done instead of using it as a layer.  I used 1/2 C. Zesty Italian dressing (Kraft).  Used 8 flour tortillas instead of 6 &amp; put it all in a 9X13 baking pan.  I used 8 oz. authenic mexican cheese blend already pre-shredded &amp; more cilantro because we love it!  This is again AMAZING &amp; would be great for any family meal or potluck.  I would precut it for a potluck though.  Cut with sharp knife first otherwise it will fall apart.  Fantastic!!

5.0,"This recipe was excellent! My family loved it. I followed the recipe exactly. It was great leftover, too."
5.0,I used ground turkey and Italian seasoning instead of the dressing and it still tasted great.

5.0,"I have been making this for years.   I have learned to just mix the hamb, sour cream, salsa, black beans and zesty italian dressing together.   Then layer with flour or corn shells and cheese.   I make this on the weekend and cover with foil to bake during the week when I don&#39;t have time to cook.  My boys who are picky eaters love it.   We call it mexican lasagna.   Oh, I also use up my green onions and cilantro if I have on hand.  "

5.0,"~LOVED IT~ I thought the recipe called for too many seasonings with the taco saeasoning,italian dressing, and cumin so I discarded the cumin, and italian seasoning and thought to add only ONE Tbsp of taco seasoning.  My husband hates beans and he loved this recipe. I thought it was very, very good and would deffinately make it again! Even better hours after baking."

5.0,"This was so good, and even great heated up the next day for leftovers!  I didn&#39;t go the low-fat, reduced sodium way and added a bit more sour cream.  One addition I made was to mash up an avocado and spread it on the first layer of sour cream before the second layer of ingredients.  Quick &amp; easy so I am sure it will become a regular at our house.  I let it set about 10 - 15 minutes before cutting it and the pieces came out perfectly!"

5.0,One other thing........I was tempted to leave out the Italian dressing after reading another review but went ahead since I wanted to give the recipe a chance.  I wouldn&#39;t change a thing as far as the dressing is concerned.  We couldn&#39;t tell it was in there at all.  Follow the recipe and you will be delighted with the results.

5.0,"I have been using this recipe for years on end whenever my bananas are ripe and it has never failed my expectations! I substitute the canola oil with safflower oil, only put in 1 cup of sugar, and use 1 more banana than recommended. Instead of using buttermilk, which I never have in my fridge, I use half and half and it works perfectly fine!Love love love this recipe, it&#39;s totally worth a shot!!"
5.0,I made this delicious loaf today and it is a winner. I made only two minor changes. I substituted sour cream for the buttermilk which I did not have and used pecans. I opted to sprinkle chopped pecans over the loaf just before popping it in the oven. We love this bread and I will be making it many more times. I highly recommend this recipe. Volunteer Field Editor
5.0,This was the first thing I have ever baked from scratch and it was incredibly delicious.  Six stars in my book.
5.0,I made this recipe as is .... no changes or substitutions.  I found it to be moist and delicious ..... loaded with banana flavor.  Highly recommended!
5.0,"This is really the best recipe for banana bread!  I made this bread many times with the great result every time. When I tested this bread, I followed the recipe exactly, did no substitutions and my bread turned out perfect. Easy to make and delicious.   I made this bread with substitutions too (yogurt or sour cream for buttermilk, raisin for nuts, more spices) and it has never failed my expectations! I highly recommend this recipe. You will not be disappointed!"
5.0,"Delicious, we like our banana bread with a strong banana taste so I used 1 1/2 cups of mashed bananas ?? and followed the rest of the recipe as is."
5.0,Excellent!
5.0,"This banana bread recipe is delicious. I give it a 5-star rating, even though it was a bit too sweet. Next time I&#39;ll try omitting 1/4 or 1/2 cup of sugar."
5.0,I just love this banana bread - which in my version is more like a cake:-) Don&#39;t like walnuts so I use pecans and then I throw in a good handful of dark chocolate chips. Yum Yum...
5.0,I love this banana bread. I&#39;ve made many times. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too sweet-in fact I always add a glaze. I also usually use pecans instead of walnuts-but I&#39;ve made with both.
5.0,Delicious!
5.0,"Very nice banana bread. Extremely easy and quick to make. I doubled the recipe, and instead of sugar, I used a sugar substitute called WHOLE EARTH sweetener Co., so I only needed half of the amount of sugar because it&#39;s very sweet. I baked it in a round 23cm pan, on 165 degrees (I&#39;m in Australia) for 1.5 hours, and for the last 10 minutes I had to cover it with a piece of foil to stop it browning too much. It&#39;s quite moist and flavourful, perfect with a cuppa. Next time I might add some cinnamon to the mix before baking.......hmmmmmm??. Thank you for a beautiful recipe. My four children lloovveedd it. My 10 year old ate at least 5 pieces in one sitting. Very good!"

5.0,This was a fantastic casserole!  I would definitely make it again.  It was a tight squeeze into the 2 qt baking dish.  It reheated well.  I substituted raspberry vinagrette for the Italian dressing as it was all that I had on hand.

5.0,"I was in a rush and wanted something quick for banana bread....I love this recipe! The bread was moist  and delicious, super quick to mix! Just a note when I don’t have buttermilk I use milk w cider vinegar ( 1 cup milk to 1 tbs vinegar) it works just as well in a pinch!"
5.0,Absolutely scrumptious!! Fixed this today and the aroma filled the house. I plan on giving this as gifts for the holidays!!!

5.0,"Delicious! I made this for my boyfriend last night, he loved it.  He took the leftovers to work for lunch too!  I cut the onions in half and used ground turkey instead, it tasted fantastic.  For the other reviewers who said theirs was soupy/runny... make sure to drain the black beans before adding.  Also, the type of salsa will make a difference too.  I used a thick and chunky type.  Very yummy!"

5.0,"Just as it says.  &#34;The Best Ever Banana Nut Bread&#34;.   I have made this Nut Bread six times.   Three times for friends and three for myself. I did, however, use, coconut, rum, and vanilla extract, ( one teaspoon each) and raw cane sugar instead of regular sugar. The very best I&#39;ve ever had."
5.0,This banana bread is very good and moist. I’ve made it several times with and without the nuts and everytime it’s tasty. The cook time might be a bit long bc mine comes out a little darker than I’d expect but the taste is still really good regardless.
5.0,"This banana bread is outstanding.  I have never had better and so simple to make!  I have made at least 6 times with a perfect outcome each bake.  I do use 2 1/2 mashed bananas, and like another viewer, use just a touch of sugar on top before baking.  Any banana bread I&#39;ve ever tried was too dry, but not this one!  Super moist and sooooo delicious!  Winner here!  I highly recommend!!!!!  cnaquin"
5.0,The title says it all.  I use brown sugar instead of white. I leave out the nuts; just a personal preference.  Sometimes I add chocolate chips in place of the nuts.
5.0,"Excellent ad easy!   I sprinkled some sugar on top and it was excellent with our morning coffee.  I said was, it was gone fast.  I will be making this regularly."
5.0,My family and I loved the bread. I used pecans instead of walnuts. I only used 1/4 cup of buttermilk. I don’t understand how an extra tablespoon could make a difference. ??? I will definitely make again.
5.0,This is without a doubt the best banana nut bread recipe I have ever found!! I always have bananas and have made countless different recipes but never found one I really liked until I made this one. I followed the directions  from start to finish and wouldn&#39;t change a thing. This bread is so moist and has the best flavor. I would completely agree with it&#39;s name....Best Ever Banana Nut Bread!
5.0,"I have used this recipe for years..with the addition of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger.  I personally find banana bread boring without the spice. I also add walnuts and sometimes chocolate chips to batter.  The best base recipe.  In use this for making pumpkin bread or zucchini.  It freezes very Well and often is better once thawed out."
5.0,"Banana bread has never been my favorite.  Turns out I had the wrong recipe!  After making this, it&#39;s now my favorite!  Title didn&#39;t lie, this IS the Best Ever Banana Bread!"
5.0,I&#39;ve tried many &#34;best banana bread&#34; recipes but this one really IS best.  It is very moist and I&#39;ve found others too dry for my liking.  I did the recipe as written except had 3 bananas that needed to be used.  Flavor is good and makes large loaf.  I will definitely be making again
5.0,"Good recipe. I substituted 1/4 cup brown sugar plus 1 1/4 cup white sugar. I also slightly toasted (and cooled) the walnuts prior to folding them into the batter. I buttered the pan and coated it with flour, as well. I like the buttermilk. The texture was outstanding. I will make this often."
5.0,Best flavored banana bread I have ever had. The English Walnuts add that special crunch and flavor. This is a keeper. I didn&#39;t change a thing!  It will replace my regular banana bread recipe! Thank you!
5.0,I haven&#39;t actually put this recipe to the test yet because we just installed a different oven last night and i still need to clean it. but the main reason is that i have a special needs diet so i will have to substitute almost every ingredient in order to be able to eat it safely. I&#39;m not sure if anyone else out there is a vegan/diabetic with no immune system but if you are then you&#39;ve got a friend. The good news is that so far the things I have made substitutions for have been on me and my family so I will be happy to share the rating and the substitutions used if anyone is interested--or I could just write a book--- LOL

5.0,"We thought this was great.  I did change a few things though.  I used the suggested Italian sausage ILO ground beef.  I also used pizza sauce ILO the tomato sauce.  We like green olives and mushrooms on pizza, so I added those to the Italian sausage mixture.  It was wondereful!"
5.0,"I&#39;m always looking for ways to hide the texture of ground beef, and tried this, we really liked it and I&#39;ll make it again--especially since I have about 30+ yellow zucchini sitting around and no freezer room!"
5.0,"We recently made a switch to lower carb eating. This was really good, and anyone who knows me knows how much I intensely dislike zucchini!  I spite of that, I made and enjoyed this dish, and will definitely make it again."
5.0,Excellent!  The only thing I added was Italian seasoning when I cooked the Italian sausage.
5.0,This recipe was really good.   The only substitution I made was using ground venison.
5.0,"And once again, I forgot to put in my stars.  This is a 5 star recipe all the way!"
5.0,Just made this the other day and it was a big hit! I like that the zucchini is baked as a crust before adding the rest.
5.0,"My DH absolutely loves this. The first time I made it as written and he was smitten ;) I&#39;ve tried multiple variations, with italian sausage and pizza sauce, with taco meat and salsa, with pepperoni on top, and he always wants me to go back to the original! So...I have a pan of the original in the oven right now! Thank you for a great recipe!"
5.0,Signed up just to review.  Very easy to make even for folks like myself with limited cooking ability.  Whole familly loved it and asked to make it again.
5.0,"I made this for supper tonight with a few modifications. I used lean ground turkey instead of beef. I didn&#39;t have any Italian dressing so I used Catalina. Other than that I followed the recipe. We had our salad as a starter instead of on top of the casserole. It made for a very satisfying dinner. My husband loved it. Mine didn&#39;t look like the picture tho&#39;-it was quite runny even after sitting the five minutes, but I will definitely be making it again."

5.0,This is delicious!  Great use of the abundant crop of zucchini from our garden. Low carb too!
5.0,"This was so good! Unfortunately, I can&#39;t leave well enough alone :(  Had to add pepperoni and olives on top when the grandkids were here - used shredded chicken, bacon and alfredo sauce in (2) 8x8&#39;s for work. Endless possibilities for an wonderful base!!"
5.0,"Wow!  If I didn&#39;t know, I would not have known that it was a zucchini base.  What a great way to use zucchini.  I used my home canned marinara sauce and it was absolutely delicious."
5.0,"My sister told me she made this and how much she liked it.  Since this is perfect for a diet I just started I thought I&#39;d try it myself.  Well, I must say, this is ONE delicious casserole!  The zucchini &#34;crust&#34; is so cheesy and delicious... it could be a side dish on it&#39;s own!  The hamburger topping just finishes it off perfectly.  The only thing I did different was to use a jar of pizza sauce instead of Italian tomato sauce and I used a tablespoon of dried onion flakes instead of chopped onion.  This is a very good recipe... on my meal rotation now."
5.0,Made this tonight.  It was wonderful.  I will be making it again as it has made the monthly rotation list in our house.
5.0,"Ate this casserole at a church potluck and had to get the recipe.  I couldn’t find Italian tomato sauce at my grocery so I just got regular tomato sauce and added some Italian seasonings.  You can also use spaghetti sauce, too instead of the tomato sauce!!"
5.0,"This was awesome! I made a few tweaks of course :)
I baked the crust at 500 for 15 minutes and then did a low broil for 3-4 minutes before adding the topping, just to crisp it up. I also added turkey pepperoni to half of the top because my hub loves it. This is exactly what we were looking for in terms of low carb pizza night. Thank you!"
5.0,"What a great idea to use zucchini! I made several changes to our liking. I fried the beef up with an entire fennel bulb. Instead of sauce, I poured sundried tomatoes over the zuke mixture. Then some canned olives, green chilies. I also didn&#39;t measure cheese, I&#39;m sure it was one half more. Took it out of the oven after 20 minutes. Topped with fresh basil and sliced mozzarella and broiled until bubbling. YUM!"
5.0,"This was excellent, and my picky kids loved it! They asked me where the zucchini was as they couldn&#39;t even taste it. I added pepperoni to ours since my family loves pepperoni. This recipe is a keeper and was a great way to use up all that garden zucchini."
5.0,"I did not have regular zucchini, but used a green squash, shredded. I did use more Mozzarella and Cheddar cheese (2 cups each), 15-oz. of pizza sauce, 3/4 of a regular onion, chopped, 1.9 lb. ground beef, 1 chopped green pepper.  The regular Parmesan cheese and eggs were kept as recipe stated. I used a smaller baking dish (11x7&#34;). The size worked out great! This is a great recipe! (I didn&#39;t have Italian-style tomato sauce on hand!)"
5.0,"Got great reviews from the family on this, was told to double it next time.  I did put a layer of pepperoni on the zucchini crust before the sauce mixture."
5.0,"Winner of a recipe, perfect for the summer garden abundance.  I did not have ground burger, so used pork sausage and it was great.  And, I confess to using pasta sauce for the tomato sauce as I had a half jar in the fridge.  But, this was super tasty and will go into my files for the future"
5.0,"This is excellent...a BIG hit! I did use Paesana New York Classic Pizza Sauce instead of tomato sauce because it&#39;s my favorite (I just eyeballed how much I used.) I also used sausage instead of hamburger and added pepperoni because I love it. I&#39;m thinking of just baking and freezing the zucchini crust, then adding the topping when I&#39;m ready to make it. I have so MANY zucchinis. I figure I can store those easier in the freezer than the whole casserole...because we will be eating this a lot, I can tell:)"
5.0,Scrumptious! What a great way to use up zucchini from my garden. I plan on making this recipe again and again. Thank you for this fantastic recipe!

5.0,This recipe is great! I like to add mushrooms to the sauce and top with black olives...yum!
5.0,Excited by this simple yet tasty gluten-free recipe!
5.0,"Great recipe.  I used pizza sauce (Prego) as recommended by other reviewers.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon  pepper, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon pizza seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon basil, 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon frozen pizza seasoning, and 1/2 t. garlic powder.  Everyone loved it - including the 2  and 8 year old grandchildren."
5.0,"This is a creative and delicious recipe with many options. I made the recipe as listed with a few minor changes: I added pepper to the crust mixture, substituted turkey, and used a red bell pepper as I find it milder for young palates. This will be a regular in my rotation. Our ten-month-old grand daughter ate three large servings!"
5.0,My family really enjoyed this recipe. I did use pizza sauce as others suggested and added Italian spices. It served closer to 4 people. Will make again!
5.0,"WOW. I am so so impressed with this recipe!! It tastes like perfection, which is an understatement. I cannot wait to make this again. Thank you so much for an awesome recipe!!!!!!"
5.0,Great recipe! My son asked if I could make again. Everyone enjoyed it.
5.0,Just did a review; forgot to add that &#34;no salt added&#34; marinara sauces are available; I use Trader Joe&#39;s organic one.
5.0,My family&#39;s favorite!
5.0,"This was good, and I only used half the ground beef (but doubled the onions)."
5.0,"I thought this was an awesome recipe,  interesting and quite tasty.  I did increase the meat to 1 1/2 pounds, and used a marinara sauce.  Thanks for sharing."
5.0,"So easy and tasty!!! This truly is delicious.... the taste that I was looking for. We&#39;ve toasted our slices and had it with butter and it was simply delish!!!!!!! Thank you for the recipe!!!! For the first time ever, I wish I had more bananas to bake more breads!!!"
5.0,Delicious and tasty.  Used 1/4 cup less sugar and it was plenty sweet.  Husband says &#34;it a keeper&#34;.  Shared with family  THANK YOU
5.0,"As advertised, this recipe truly is the best banana bread EVER!  Since finding this recipe a month ago, I have made three loaves.  My husband can not eat it fast enough.  I shortened the cooking time to 1 hour 10 minutes (I think it depends on the type of pan you use)…. results are amazing!  Definitely will cook again and again!"
5.0,I have used a lot of different recipes but this one is by far the best!  My mom always put the bread on a paper plate when almost completely cooled and placed into a sealed plastic bag overnight and it makes it so moist!  I will use this recipe again!!
5.0,It was wonderful.  I made two loaves and put chocolate chips in one.  They were both delicious.  This recipe will be added to my &#34;favorite&#34; recipes.
5.0,I love this banana bread!  Never ever had I used a different recipe!
5.0,"My favorite banana bread recipe. I make it as muffins, which bake for around 24 minutes. Delicious!"
5.0,"It’s true, it’s the best banana bread that I’ve ever made or tasted. I used pecans as that’s what I had on hand. Muffins great idea. Be sure to use a larger loaf sized pan. Baking time varies. My bake time over an hour.  VFE. A must try."
5.0,"Absolutely delicious!  This really is the best banana bread.  Mine baked at 325 for about an hour and a half.  I used the chocolate chip option instead of walnuts and threw in a handful of leftover toffee bits as well.  This bread is moist on the inside, with a crispy crust on the outside.  Can&#39;t say enough about it.  We loved it and will definitely make again~  VFE"
5.0,"So delicious and easy to make.  You can put add ins if you want to change it up for your family, but it is good just as written.  Will file  this one for future use!"
5.0,"I made the recipe as given, but substituted toasted pecans for the walnuts, and baked in paper lined muffin pans. This recipe made 18 regular size muffins. These were very moist and delicious! I will definitely make these again!"
5.0,"Very good recipe. Delish! Question: I would like to add chocolate chips instead of the walnuts. (Grandkids prefer the chocolate chips.) How much would I add? 1 cup, like the chopped walnuts? And what about a mixture of chocolate chips and nuts? 1/2 cup of each?"
5.0,"Love this recipe!! I never liked banana bread, but this recipe has changed my mind. I have mad it several times now, and also gave a loaf to relatives who also loved it. Easy to make  and freezes well. My mom likes to slice and bag it separately for the freezer, then she has a snack that thaws quickly. I would do the same, but we wind up eating it all before I can freeze any. Definitely recommend trying this recipe!"
5.0,"I use 1 cup of bananas, whatever nuts I have on hand.  Sometimes I add 1.5 cups blueberries (takes longer to cook).  Sometimes Apples.  I like to cook these in mini-loave pans.  I get four out of the recipe.  For Blueberry I cooked for 40-45min.  All others 30-35mins."
5.0,"Very easy, moist and delicious! A keeper for sure!"
5.0,This really is the best banana bread. I did add an extra small banana and used toasted pecans because that is what I had. This is moist and flavorful. It&#39;s everything you want and hope in a banana bread. Normally with a slice of banana bread I butter it. This is so good I didn&#39;t need the butter.
5.0,"This is tasty. I sliced my zucchini very thin instead of shredding it. I mixed it with the eggs, parm cheese, and half the other cheeses but didn&#39;t bake it until I added the remaining ingredients as listed."
5.0,"Made this last night for a potluck today.  Everyone loved it-I work with lots of people on &#34;Keto&#34; and I was really glad to find something they could eat without needing to change anything!   Just make sure you get the excess moisture out of the Zucchini, I layer mine on a cookie sheet and dried it out a bit (400 for 10 min) before I cooled and combined it with the egg and cheese)  and you can get it firm without being too dry!"
5.0,"I knew from reading this recipe that it would be tasty. I am usually one of those review readers who does eye rolls when reading that the reviewer followed the recipe except for...then lists a long list of modifications. Well, I made some changes, too, and the outcome was great. I followed the process instructions as written. I used sweet Italian sausage instead of ground beef as I wanted a little zippier flavor, more pizza-like. I also added 1 tsp. of minced garlic after the sausage-onion mixture was browned (who doesn&#39;t like a little garlic in pizza?) My grocery store did not have Italian tomato sauce so I used regular and added 1 tsp. of Italian seasoning. Since the recipe called for either red or green pepper, I used half of a red pepper and half of a green pepper, giving the dish a colorful look. My husband was a bit skeptical until the first bite--then he was a convert. He raved about it and I do have to say, it was delicious. I  had split the mixture into two casseroles with the idea of bake-one-freeze-one. I&#39;ll have to see how that goes next time I make it because we&#39;ve plowed right into the next casserole the next night; leftovers were as delicious as the first night. I have strict instructions to make this dish again. ;)"
5.0,"This is our favorite main dish zucchini recipe!  Just top it with whatever your favorite pizza toppings are if you want more flavor than the ground beef.  I usually use the ground beef, onion, tomato sauce layer then might add some pepperoni, olives, sausage, additional onion, mushrooms......whatever I want on my pizza.   Love it, love the results, not watery at all."
5.0,This was really good.
5.0,Used ground turkey instead of ground beef and added Italian spices to the meat and the zucchini mix.  Everyone loved it
5.0,I followed the recipe and it was wonderful! My son’s dad even liked it ! And he doesn’t eat anything green! Need to dry the zucchini more but this is a keeper!
5.0,"This recipe finally got my husband to eat zucchini!  Not only that, he&#39;s been requesting it at least once a week since I discovered it on your site a few months ago.  Getting the zucchini dry enough to crisp up was a challenge, but we started using a hand-held ricer to squeeze out small batches after shredding it in the food processor to save time.  It makes a huge difference, and I find that using a stoneware bar pan is a big help as well.  I toss in a handful of italian seasonings to give the crust a little more flavor, and have made this with a variety of meats in the sauce (ground chicken, turkey, beef . . . even elk!) and it has come out fantastic every time.  It only gets better the longer you let it cook!"
5.0,"Love Love Love the zucchini crust.  I&#39;ve made the recipe several times, similar to as written, I substituted pizza sauce.  Also, I take the grated zucchini and place on a clean dishtowel and wring out the moisture, no salt no colander.  This last time, I made it like a real pizza.  DELICIOUS"
5.0,"I made this with the veggies from my garden. It was so tasty that I will definitely make it again. I found that it did not feed eight, unless you have several sides or a giant salad. The reason I like casseroles so much is so I don&#39;t have to make sides ;-).  I feel to have it as a stand alone meal, that the more appropriate servings listed would be 5 or 6. Next time I make it (which i will for sure), I will double the recipe if I intend to feed more than 4.  Loved it!"
5.0,Great recipe and really easy to make hotdish.  (Can&#39;t believe anyone from Minnesota would call it a casserole)
5.0,Made this recently for a potluck. It was delicious! Even the people who said they didn&#39;t like zucchini loved it. This one is a keeper!
5.0,This is one of my favorite recipes. I made this for my bunco group and they all wanted the recipe. This is a keeper!!
5.0,"Tried and true recipe. I made it with ground buffalo and a bit more spices, but how can you go wrong? Definitely try it."
5.0,"I cooked the pepper in with the hamburger, because we don&#39;t like ours crunchy.  It was very good.  We also did add a little more salt and some pepper."
5.0,https://pakrealestatenews.wordpress.com/2019/08/08/dha-defence-islamabad/
5.0,Great recipe!  I use half ground beef and half hot Italian sausage.
5.0,Delicious! The kids will love it. Healthy
5.0,"Love this. I &#39;drain&#39; zucc by spreading out large kitchen towel or two, cover with a couple layers of paper towel, then AFTER  I&#39;ve pushed all the liquid I can out through the colander, I spread the zucc on the towel layers and roll it up - TIGHT. May take a couple times, but it really does the trick and then your crust will be crisper.  Also, my grandsons think pepperoni is a food group so we don&#39;t use beef or sausage - just spread pizza sauce over crust, put a think layer of pepperoni on this, then your cheeses and veggies.  Sometimes bacon with the pepperoni (WHY NOT?!?!)  After it&#39;s done everyone puts their own toppings on as desired.  They love to help make it, too, so are happy to eat it :)"
5.0,"This is my favorite pizza recipe. I don&#39;t do bread and this smells so pizza awesome, I can&#39;t get enough!"
5.0,"Lynn&#39;s recipe was fantastic! My whole family loved a new dish, which I feel doesn&#39;t happen that often :) I forgot the red or green pepper, but it still tasted great. I added a little drizzle of olive oil to the zucchini part just before layering on the meat sauce. Really really delish--and easy."
5.0,"Excellent! Hubby had 3 helpings! The only addition I made was 1 tsp Italian seasoning. Next time I’ll try sausage, garlic"
5.0,"I did as someone suggested, made half the recipe &amp; put in 8x8 baking dish.  I used Prego, and squeezed the zucchini with paper towels to remove more moisture.  FABULOUS!  Even my zucchini-hating hubby loves this!  Will be making this again!!"
5.0,Loved it!  Did add some more Italian seasoning to it.
5.0,"We love this &#34;casserole&#34;!  We are on a low-carb diet, my husband and I, and have a craving for Italian food, especially pizza.  This has solved our problem without busting the diet.  After the first time I made it, I have changed it a bit, not in the recipe, but in the preparation.  Since there are only 2 of us, I make the bottom &#34;crust&#34; in 2 8X8 inch pans, lined with parchment paper, partly up the side, and sprayed with cooking spray.  I make half of the recipe in each, and cook it as directed.  After cooling, I lift it out by the parchment, put both in a freezer container, and freeze until we are ready to use it.  When we need a pizza, we take one &#34;crust&#34;, thaw it in the 8X8 pan,  and put the toppings on, cook it in the oven as the recipe calls for.  It is almost as quick as a frozen pizza!"
5.0,This is just delicious! I followed the directions exactly. We all loved it!
5.0,"My husband said this is a keeper. I added some red pepper flakes to the zucchini mixture, Used Prego pizza sauce &amp; added garlic &amp; Italian seasoning to the meat. He is on a low carb diet."
5.0,"Excellent! Was looking for another low carb dish when I found this. I sauteed some chopped mushrooms and added them to the sauce, omitted the pepper cause we don&#39;t like it. I used marinara sauce that was low in sugar in place of the tomato sauce. This is very tasty! My hubby suggested next time to use Italian sausage instead of ground beef but I thought it was perfect."
5.0,"Made this again with turkey sausage instead of the hamburger. Much tastier, and hubby loved it. So need to up the rating to a 5 instead of a 4. Would definitely have again and again"
5.0,Perfect as is. Almost no carbs.
5.0,"We loved it.  Hubby said it was a definite keeper and was even better the next day.  Only changes I made based on some other readers was to make sure the water was squeezed  out of the zukes, and I added a can of mushrooms, Italian herbs, and extra mozzarella (because I had it).  Can&#39;t wait to make it again.  Next time am going to add Italian sausage to it.  Great recipe."
5.0,Love this thank you made with ground turkey breast yummy and freezes well for lunches
5.0,"This was wonderful!  My husband and I are both on keto, and this tasted so good!  It makes for good leftovers as well.  I followed the recipe exactly except for using frozen zucchini (lots of water to squeeze out!) because I didn&#39;t have any fresh on hand.  I will definitely be making this again when we have a bunch of zucchini fresh from our garden!"
5.0,This is a great way to use up all that zucchini! I added some garlic and using sausage gave it more flavor.
5.0,This is so simple and so good! Had an abundance of zucchini from the garden and this is one of our favorite ways to eat zucchini. The only change I made is that sometimes I add slices of pepperoni before adding the cheese topping. A winner!
5.0,We really liked this. A good way to get your veggies!
5.0,"Just picked a bag of zucchini so decided to try this recipe for supper. I doubled the recipe except used 1 1/2 lb ground beef and added a little garlic powder, italian seasoning and basil to the sauce. Baked the &#34;crust&#34; for 27 minutes but will do longer next time as the casserole ended up a little watery. Used a  25 minute second bake. Even my zucchini hating husband raved about it!"
5.0,This was amazing!!  HUGE hit!!!
5.0,WE LOVED THIS!!!!!!! Will definitely make again.My husband said it&#39;s better than spaghetti.  Used canned pizza sauce and Parmesan on top. Could use a little more zucchini. I think I need to start growing zucchini. LOL
5.0,"We have made this many times and love it.  I use pizza sauce instead of tomato sauce which is more flavorful.  To lighten it up a little, we use 2 percent cheese and turkey italian sausage or turkey pepperoni.  Very easy to freeze and take in my lunch later too."
5.0,"Just made this and will be making it again but found it a bit bland, so the next time I make it I&#39;ll be adding a little heat and different (more pungent) cheese combination.  I didn&#39;t saute the red peppers and loved it that way.  Hubby just went for seconds - a good sign.  Update:  Just realized I used tomato sauce instead of a spiced Italian sauce.  My bad.  Trying it again - this time I&#39;ll read the directions more carefully."
5.0,"Been making this for years, I call it zucchini parmesian. I saute some fresh garlic, coat the zuchiini with some flaoved breat crummbs then fry just a little,put in casserole dish,  then just ad my marinara sauce, mozzarella and parmesian and bake.  Very flavorful with just the two cheeses."
5.0,"This is also good as a Mexican casserole. Switch your cheeses to  Mexican mix cheeses and pepper jack.  Same with sauce, try rotel or even an enchilada sauce with chunky salsa."
5.0,"I also added some extra Italian seasoning and garlic powder. My husband, who usually does not care for vegetables, went back for more!"
5.0,"Very tasty, versatile crust. Great way to use up the zucchini overload. Even those who don&#39;t care for zucchini will enjoy it. Have made it with a layer of ricotta, fresh tomatoes  and basil instead of the  the meat sauce for a vegetarian alternative."
5.0,"This was fantastic!  We don&#39;t eat a lot of pizza because of the carbs, so this is an incredible substitute for pizza!  We will definitely be making it again!"
5.0,Excellent! I liked it better fresh out of the oven so I will stick to a 1/2 recipe (8&#34; square pyrex) to limit leftovers. Delicious!! (PS - I used ground chicken instead of beef to lower cholesterol - couldn&#39;t tell one bit of difference.)
5.0,Made it with Italian sausage instead of ground beef and added 2 tsp minced garlic.  Yummy!  Everyone loved it! I like the zucchini crust especially since it cuts down on carbs.  Will definitely be making this again!
5.0,So delicious!  I did use fresh grated Parmesan cheese and topped with fresh sliced mozzarella. Didn&#39;t add any shredded mozzarella to the zucchini mixture only used Cheddar and Parmesan and still came out great!
5.0,"Excellent recipe. I wouldn&#39;t call it pizza per se, reminded me more of carb-less lasagna. I cut the amount of  ground beef in half, doubled the onions and added about as much mushrooms. I used jarred Barilla traditional pasta sauce. Next time I&#39;m thinking of using only half the cheese in the zucchini mix and replacing that amount with more zucchini, and double the salt. I&#39;ll also add garlic as many commenters have suggested. It holds up well as leftovers."
5.0,Have made this several times and everyone loves it!
5.0,This was very good.  Will be making again very soon.  Thank you for such a great recipe.
5.0,"My husband really enjoyed the meal.  Didn&#39;t have enough of some of the cheeses, used what I had.  Next time I&#39;m going to top it with saute or canned mushroom,  you could top it with any of your favorite topping."
5.0,This is definitely  a do it again.  I will try adding some other &#34;pizza&#34; toppings next time.
5.0,"With over 200 5-star reviews, I felt this dish was a no brainer. (I like to try new TOH recipes that don&#39;t have as many reviews yet, but I wanted a sure fire meal for tonight.) It was YUMMY.....loved the baked shredded zucchini-cheese  base and can&#39;t go wrong with a tomato beef mixture with more cheese.  Two thumbs way up and a perfect casserole to make anytime.  Husband liked as much as I did."
5.0,"I made this casserole on 11/1/16 and it&#39;s delicious!  I did use 3 small red peppers, ground turkey in place of the beef, 2 cups shredded Pizza cheese blend and 1 cup Pepper-Jack/Cheddar cheese blend since I had those prepared cheeses on hand.  I&#39;d also added 1 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper to the ground turkey/chopped onion and I used a 15-oz. can pizza sauce. I used a 3-qt. casserole. delowenstein"
5.0,"This deserves all the fantastic reviews!  If you are looking for recipes that will work well with a spiralizer, I used my thin-cut zucchini noodles instead of shredding them and it was great.  I loved seeing my kids inhale all the zucchini!"
5.0,"This is excellent. I loved that it tastes like pizza and the zucchini was essentially hidden in the dish. I did make a few changes - ground turkey instead of ground beef and I ran out of mozzarella cheese so I ended up using cheddar to replace it. I would absolutely make this again, maybe adding a few pizza toppings to it as well."
5.0,"I have made this many times now and every time it&#39;s still fantastic!  Only changes I&#39;ve made is that I use frozen chopped peppers and onions and cook them with the hamburger, I also use plain tomato sauce and just add italian seasoning and garlic."
5.0,I made this years ago for my veggie hating kids. Making it now for my veggie hating grandkids. Hubby and I love it and the grandkids don&#39;t know what they&#39;re eating! Works for me!!
5.0,"Has become a favorite at my house, added two cloves of garlic to the sauce and half onion and its delicious !"
5.0,Love this ......great way to use up a jar of pizza sauce too... come summer everyone has  Zucchinis ....everything is in this meal too...a filling side dish or a complete meal.... Made it in ramekins...a good way to serve it too...spray the ramekins tho...sausage substitute work&#39;s as well...biggest deal is getting ALL the water out of the Zucchini ....
5.0,"This recipe is really really good.  I&#39;ve also used the zucchini, cheese, and egg mix as the base for Eggplant Parmesan instead of pasta.  Everyone loves it."
5.0,Loved this recipe.  The only thing I did differently was I cooked the peppers with beef and onions.  Tastes even better as leftovers the next day!
5.0,"This recipe is really good, and a great summer dish for when zucchinis are in abundance.  I loved the zucchini crust.  It was such a nice change of pace to a heavy bread crust.  The only changes I made were based on using ingredients on hand - used an Italian cheese blend for the mozzarella and a colby-jack blend for the cheddar because I had both of those.  I love a dish that is versatile in that way so just use whatever cheese combo you like best on this dish and you should have a winner.  Also, I took the advice of others and cooked the bell pepper with the beef and onions because my family prefers that combo.  My skeptical pizza loving daughter ate this and said it was good.  I will definitely be making this dish again."
5.0,Absolutely delicious and so easy!!
5.0,"I&#39;ve been a fan of banana bread ever since I was a child and this one is delicious! I substituted chocolate chips for the walnuts, which my husband and I enjoyed."
5.0,"This by far is the best banana bread I&#39;ve made.  In fact, much less time consuming than ones I&#39;ve used in the past.  I included half a cup of dark semi-sweet chocolate chips, which made a delicious combination with the walnuts.  This one is a keeper!"
5.0,this is the one I have been looking for finally after 2 years
5.0,"This is definitely the best banana bread I have ever made.  I made extra loafs to give to family members and they all raved about how good it was.  On some loaves I did add a little nutmeg and cinnamon and it also tasted good with those spices.  Either way, this is the best banana bread!!!"
5.0,"This is the easiest and best tasting banana bread ever. I put raisins in one loaf and blueberries in another, yum."
5.0,"This really is the best banana bread recipe. Actually, I use the Pampered Chef brownie pan and make muffins using the recipe. Makes 24 and baking time is about 15 minutes. I lessen the sugar to 1 cup.  Sometimes I add mini chocolate chips. I also use this recipe with ground zucchini using the full amount of sugar. (I grind or finely grate the zucchini and squeeze out the moisture.)"
5.0,I made this recipe into muffins. Yield 12 medium sized and 8 mini muffins. I swapped 1 cup of the sugar for Splenda and used 1/2 cup of regular sugar. I added mini chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of walnuts. Excellent! Will make it into a loaf next time as well.
5.0,"I had 4 ripe bannas so i used all of them in this recipe. Used cake flour. I did not have butter milk but made my own with heavy cream and white vinegar which turned into a sour cream consistency. Used banna extract and vanilla. Omitted the nuts. Poured into bundt pan. For some reason some of it stuck to the sides of the pan (so will try loaf pan w parchment next time)....Made a frosting with heavy cream, powder sugar, pinch salt, cinnamon. This was a hit, i will definitely use this recipe again!"
5.0,"Ok.. I make banana bread at least twice a month with the OLD bananas...as we never manage to eat a full bunch.  So yes this is a good basic recipe, and yes I changed a bunch.  I added butter instead of canola oil, one stick, added a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, yes and three bananas instead of two, did not have butter milk but used a 1/4 cup of Almond milk, how did it taste?   Lol.  I will let you know."
5.0,I try a variety of  banana bread recipes and this 1 is easy and everyone loves ir. My husband said that we could stay with this recipe from now on!
5.0,"Gin, I’m sorry your bread failed. I had that problem too. During Covid I was t able to get my usual flour aid I settled for an different brand. It failed every time. Now I have my Gold Medal All-Purpose Flour again and it’s terrific!!  Try Gold Medal. This really is the best recipe I’ve ever tried."
5.0,"I have used this recipe for almost 30 years. It is the best. For those that have had problems, I have used wide pan loaf pans. It does cook dark. But if you cook for 1 hour 20 minutes at 325, rotating half way through, you will be successful.  Try adding mini morsels. You’ll also want to store in a zip top bag and refrigerate. Enjoy!"
5.0,"Excellent! Great low carb dish to satisfy cravings for pizza. Will be making this and changing up the meat/veggies to make different varities(this time I used ground beef,mushrooms and black olives. I also added seasoning to tomato sauce (red pepper flakes, garlic powder and Italian seasoning."
5.0,I&#39;ve made this recipe several times as written.  It&#39;s a great way to use zucchini and it&#39;s always a hit.
5.0,I made this tonight and I must say it is delicious.  I did take a couple of suggestions from others: 1)  I drained the zucchini for about 30 minutes then I pressed out as much moisture as I could in the strainer - then transferred to paper towel and blotted some more - my casserole was not runny;  2)  I added 1/2 tsp basil and 1/2 tsp oregano and 2 minced garlic cloves to tomato sauce mixture and sauteed the green peppers with the meat and onion.  The sauce was anything but bland.  I will be making this recipe for a long time to come.  Thank you.
5.0,"I made this yesterday with zucchini fresh from the garden. I actually cut the recipe in half, and it turned out just fine. I also did not use hamburger but instead, we used 1 cup of pepperoni ."
5.0,"This was excellent!  Recommend: cooking red pepper with beef and adding garlic, Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes to amp up the flavors!  We really enjoyed this!"
5.0,"My family devoured this delicious dish. After reading the reviews I made sure to dry the zucchini well, and I jazzed up my sauce with some fresh herbs (basil, parsley and oregano) and garlic, and instead of ground beef I used hot and spicy breakfast sausage I had on hand. Can&#39;t wait to make it again with a layer of sauteed mushrooms! Thanks for this great recipe."
5.0,Excellent recipe!
5.0,Made this for the second time yesterday. It was very good. Will definitely make it often during zucchini season.
5.0,"I&#39;ve made this twice in the last two weeks, as it&#39;s become one of my husband&#39;s top faves of my recipes. It&#39;s just the two of us, so I always halve the recipe and bake it in an 8X8 pan (it takes a little less time, and I cover it for the last ten minutes of baking to prevent over browning), and we get three dinners out of it. This time, I made it in the morning, as (1) it doesn&#39;t heat the house up quite as much earlier in the day, and (2) we both think it tastes better after it sits awhile. I generally avoid cheesy-meaty dishes during the hotter months, but this one doesn&#39;t come off as heavy because of the zucchini &#34;crust&#34;. I&#39;ve made it without the peppers on top or with roasted red peppers, and it&#39;s super either way."
5.0,"This recipe was so easy to make.  A little different way to use zucchini.  My guests loved it.Served six, not eight.  I will definitely make it again."
5.0,"Excellent!  I used half summer squash and half zucchini-a perfect use for some of the squash our garden  is giving us. I substituted mild provolone cheese for the cheddar and added some slices of turkey pepperoni for a little more &#34;pizza&#34; flavor. I also gave the top of the casserole a sprinkling of Penzey&#39;s Frozen Pizza seasoning-that really sealed the deal. We loved this casserole-I&#39;ll definitely be making it again. Thank you, Lynn!"
5.0,"Made this tonight for supper.  There was just the 2 of us.  We liked it so much we ate over half of it.  Leftovers tomorrow.  I followed recipe pretty much to a tee, loved it!"
5.0,"Outstanding recipe! Anyone who&#39;s tasted this ALWAYS requests the recipe. Yes, it&#39;s that darn good!"
5.0,My husband and I loved this dish - very flavorful and easily made.  I followed the recipe as written except for the substitution of pizza sauce for the tomato sauce.  I like that this casserole may also be frozen and the next time I make it (and there will definitely be a next time!) I think I will put it into two 8&#34; dishes and pop one in the freezer for later.  Great recipe!
5.0,"Family loves this recipe!!  I skipped the green pepper, but added garlic and mushrooms.   I used one can of tomato sauce and 1 can of diced tomatoes drained and pureed to give it some texture and also added Italian seasoning, basil and garlic powder.  I have shared this with many friends.  Thank you!"
5.0,Good way to use garden zucchini.
5.0,"I made this for my family using fresh Zucchini from our garden. I will definitely make it again, especially for my husband."
5.0,This was delicious and a great way to use up zucchini. I love the fact it had vegetables in it and my son had no idea!
5.0,great  tasting will make it again  my guests loved it and asked for the recipe it was yummy everyone had two helpings. it was easy to make .
5.0,"Love, love, love this recipe! And it reheats wonderfully. Great way to sneak in veggies too."
5.0,I passed this recipe along to a friend who made it for a church potluck and everyone wanted the recipe.  She made some and brought it to work and got the same rave reviews!
5.0,Everyone loved this.
5.0,"I don&#39;t eat carbs (pasta, etc) and can&#39;t wait to make this.  Will probably add some ricotta on top of the zucchini."
5.0,"Very good recipe!!   I, too, added a bit more seasoning to the meat (oregano and garlic) but otherwise made as written.    I tend to like my food a bit more spicy so thought maybe I&#39;d add some dried pepper flakes to the meat the next time.   Very good warmed up the next day, too!!    I can&#39;t wait for zucchini season to make this again and again!!!"
5.0,"This recipe is great; it&#39;s delicious and different. We tried it with sausage instead of beef first, and that was way too salty; that is not the fault of the recipe though. I add Italian seasoning to the sauce and cook the green pepper with the onion."
5.0,"Awesome! We practically  cleaned out the bowl. No left-overs, so sad."
5.0,"I made this dish for a book club I just recently joined. It was a big hit . BANG!!everybody wants the recipe, Great way to utilize the abundance of veggie this time of year,"
5.0,I made this for my husband&#39;s coworkers. It was a big hit. Very easy to make and a great way to get people to eat their veggies. I added one tsp of parsley to the sauce bc I could only find plain sauce.
5.0,"Made this tonight and we both loved it.  Since I just had regular tomato sauce, I added Italian seasoning and some garlic powder.  Definitely a keeper."
5.0,"Very good, but extremely high in fat and cholesterol. So not really a &#34;healthy dish&#34; but very tasty."
5.0,Very good! I used sausage instead of ground beef.. Also added pizza sauce to tomato sauce because I didn&#39;t have Italian tom sauce. I will definitely make again..
5.0,Awesome will make again and again
5.0,"This was wonderful tasting!  In place of the ground beef I used sausage and in place of the Italian tomato sauce I used homemade marinara.  The zucchini will be soggy if you don&#39;t drain it properly, but it still tastes good.  You can pour off the extra liquid for nice and firm leftovers."
5.0,"My husband is NOT a picky eater - but my children and I are.  We all loved this so much we made it twice and brought it to a family party where it was devoured!  Great texture, flavor and taste.  I made sure to not only drain the zucchini but blotted it with paper towels - It was PERFECT!"
5.0,great recipe. Good way to use up all the zucchini from our garden.
5.0,This was very good and I liked adding nutrition by using zucchini instead of a bread crust.
5.0,"Made for dinner tonight for my adult son and I!Omgosh, it&#39;s so delicious, thank you ,I didn&#39;t have mozzarella so I grated string cheeseI used two can tomato sauce and sprinkled with Italian seasoning and garlic powder! YumOh an a dash of sugar, yes sugar about a teaspoon! I omitted the green peppers didn&#39;t have any, but sprinkle chopped green onions (scallions) yumI wanted to get seconds, think I&#39;ll wait till tomorrow  CALORIES LOLGOOD LUCKMUCH ALOHACINDY WILSON"
5.0,"I have enjoyed this recipe, as written and it was delicious.  I have now added my own additions and use hot sausage in place of the beef.  I have also used pizza sauce to make it more like pizza and added traditional pizza toppings.  Great taste anyway you decide to make it and it is a great recipe for those that are doing keto or low carb diets."
5.0,Awesome!
5.0,I made this recipe the other night and it is Fantastic.  I didn&#39;t use  tomato sauce... I used a can of stewed tomatoes and added 1 tblspn of basil and thyme to make it more Italian.  I cooked it down until the liquid dissipated.   It was Super Delicious!!!!
5.0,"Had last night for dinner and it was excellent. We are trying to go low carb and this looked great.   I made sure the zucchini was well drained and I baked it 25 minutes and the crust was fine. I did leave out the cheddar cheese and added more Parmesan. I also used turkey Italian sausage for more flavor and we don&#39;t eat much beef.  Topped with it with regular jar spaghetti sauce since that is all I had and yellow peppers, onion, some garlic.   So yummy!"
5.0,I loved this recipe.  Different.  Great way to use zucchini.  Flavors even better day 2 and beyond.  Enjoying to the last bite!!
5.0,very good
5.0,I look forward to making this dish. I love zucchini and pizza so this is a great  combo.  And it&#39;s a good way to get my family to eat more veggies.
5.0,"Whole family loved it!  Added some oregano , basil and garlic powder. Next time will replace 1/2 pound of burger with Italian sausage"
5.0,Excellent!
5.0,"I&#39;ve been a subscriber to Taste of Home since the very early 90&#39;s and have to say this is my first review of any recipe. Believe me, my family has many favorite TOH  recipes, but I have to say this is excellent. I added a teaspoon each of dried basil, oregano, and garlic powder to the zucchini mixture. Instead of ground beef I used 1/2 lb each of ground sirloin and turkey sausage. I also used mushrooms. I know I hate when someone rates a recipe after they changed it, but it would be just as delicious made as printed. Thanks  Lynn for a great way to use up an abundance of zucchini!"
5.0,I fixed this last night for my husband &amp; me~delicious! I used venison for the meat &amp; a little variation on the cheeses~added my own spices to tomato sauce~only because this is all I had on hand but you couldn&#39;t ask for it to be any better than this! Thank you~definitely a keeper:)
5.0,"This got my husbands 2 thumbs up...had it today for lunch.  I did add 1tsp each, basil, oregano and garlic powder to sauce along with fresh mushrooms on top. Definitely a keeper!"
5.0,"My husband HATES zucchini!  When I served this dish, he raved and raved about it.  He thought the zucchini crust was actually rice, but when I told him what it really was, he just smiled and went back for seconds!!!  I will definitely make this again.  Next time, we may add olives to it for some extra zing, but the recipe is great as-is!!!"
5.0,This was really good.  I thought it tasted more like lasagna than pizza.  Maybe it was because I used a jar of spaghetti sauce in place of the tomato sauce.  I did follow the ret of the recipe.  I will make this again!!!!
5.0,"I made this tonight for supper with few adjustments -- package of ground turkey was a little more than a pound so added more onion plus used Prego Chunky Garden Tomato, Onion &amp; Garlic spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce.  Didn&#39;t measure the cheese -- anyone who loves cheese doesn&#39;t care if there is more.  Most of the ingredients as to the amounts can be adjusted to your preference.  It was wonderful. My husband thought it was really good &amp; kept taking a little more &amp; a little more. I will definitely be making it again."
5.0,Family loved it. Next time I&#39;ll double it.
5.0,Great way to use up my vast supply of zuchinni
5.0,Loved this and enjoyed the leftovers a few days later.  Delicious!  I added a small can of petite diced tomatoes (well drained).  Have prepared it several times already.
5.0,This was very good.  I used spaghetti sauce in place of the tomato sauce.
5.0,"How I made the recipe shown: I did green onion instead of white onion, no ground beef, turkey bacon without nitrates, red and green bell peppers diced, and my bottom layer (crust) also contained squash with the zucchini. I used a food processor attachment to shred the zuke and squash.   Added an extra egg white as I had I had more veggies at the bottom layer. Added crushed red pepper to my pizza sauce layer. IT WAS AWESOME!!!"
5.0,Followed SKS2&#39;s review and made with spaghetti sauce. Husband and 1 year old loved it! Will definitely make again.
5.0,Delicious!
5.0,"This is a awesome pizza for a gluten free diet. I used my home made  red sauce omitted the cheddar cheese and topped it with sauteed mushrooms, onions, orange pepper,  &amp; black olives,  and topped with green onion before serving."
5.0,Excellent Recipe! A definite &#34;do over&#34;.
5.0,I love this recipe!  It&#39;s one of the reasons we grow zucchini!
5.0,"This was awesome.  My entire family loves it.  I usually use sausage, pizza sauce and add green peppers, and fresh mushrooms.  This is a keeper."
5.0,"This was good, but I think I like LKimK77 recipe so I&#39;m going to try it except for home made sauce, I&#39;ll use  pizza sauce and no bell pepper (we can&#39;t eat them) I&#39;ll use a banana or sweet pepper"
5.0,My husband and I loved it. Since we live in New Mexico I added chopped  green  chile. It is a keeper.  Next time I will also add fresh mushrooms.
5.0,"Both my husband and I liked it and my kids loved it! I did add some seasonings to the crust: garlic, Italian seasoning, basil, and oregano."
5.0,"I have made this bread, large and small loaves and muffins, many times and it has turned out perfect everytime. I always use whole wheat flour and brown sugar and/ or a little honey, and cut back on they sugar a little. I also add blueberries, dried cherries, apple and rhubarb, sometimes separately or in some combination. They also add some sweetness so i can reduce the sugar, and extra   moisture to compensate for the whole wheat flour. The best banana bread anywhere and everyone that eats mine says the same thing! Thank you for sharing a great recipe!!"
5.0,The title is not a lie! agree ?? this is the best banana bread. Very simple ingredients and easy to make. The only thing I changed is the buttermilk which I substituted to vanilla yogurt since I do not have buttermilk at home. It taste so delicious and moist. I cooked about 1 hr and 10 mins. Cooled it down and wrapped in a foil and placed in the refrigerator and it was perfect ?? yummy ?? banana ?? bread ?? ever...
5.0,This banana bread tasted great and it was very easy to prepare. I love that it uses oil as the fat - makes preparation so fast and easy!
5.0,I make this so often I have the recipe memorized!  I usually make 1/2 of it in muffin tins and the rest in a small loaf pan.  I individually wrap the muffins with plastic wrap and put in a freezer zip lock bag to freeze.  It is easy to pull one out and defrost in the microwave.  My husband loves them for breakfast &#34;desert&#34;.  I usually substitute applesauce for the oil and add cinnamon because my husband loves it.  Sometimes I substitute almond extract for the vanilla.
5.0,Perfect banana bread! Had 3 ripe ones so used them. Otherwise baked per recipe even the timing. Very moist. Looks identical to your pic!
5.0,Delicious banana bread!
5.0,Good one
5.0,Anyone ever try the Buttermilk Substitute for the buttermilk needed; use 1 tablespoon of white vinegar plus enough milk to measure 1 cup?  (Then divvy out whats needed for the recipe.)                                                                                                                                                   Its a frigid day with everyone clamoring for Banana Bread! Dont want to trek out to the store!
5.0,Best banana bread ever. Used pecans instead of walnuts as a preference. Took about 1:23 in a gas range. Perfect.
5.0,Add 1 tsp cinnamon to dry ingredients and it makes this recipe that much better!
5.0,Best Ever Banana Bread is a great recipe! No alterations needed :)
5.0,I have made this recipe several times.  My family and neighbors like it.  At 350 it always burns the bottom and the ends. Today I was determined to get a good one.  I started at 350 but after reading some reviews lowered the temperature to 325. That made a nice banana bread not burnt.  The bread bakes dark.  Also I baked it for 1 hr 10 min. Given how many people have the burnt ends I think Taste of Home should make a correction or a comment.
5.0,This recipe has an amazing flavor.  I did change a few things. 1.  I divided my sugar.  1 cup white 1/2 cup brown sugar.  2.  I also used milk with a tablespoon lemon juice to substitute for the buttermilk that I didn&#39;t have.  3.  I also lowered my temp to 325.  I was using a cast iron bread pan.  It cooks hotter.  4.  I only cooked it for 1 hr. then let it cool for the 15 minutes.  Loved the parchment paper.  It definitely made clean up easier.  Thank you for a tasty recipe.
5.0,"Made this for my book club, but used sour cream instead of buttermilk, which I was out of.  *It came out great - they all asked for recipe"
5.0,Awesome recipe!  I deviated a bit substituting ground turkey for ground beef and using a Monterey Jack Jalapeño cheese blend instead of the cheddar.  This recipe is great for low carb diets.  I look forward to making it again with other popular  pizza toppings like mushrooms!
5.0,It was great.  The hardest part was drying our the zucchini.  I added mushrooms and olives.
5.0,"Everyone likes this casserole who&#39;ve tried it!  I use pizza sauce and add pizza toppings that we like: mushrooms, turkey pepperoni, pineapple, etc.  I make it very often year round."
5.0,Made just as written (except for subbing pasta sauce for tomato sauce).  A keeper for sure.  Love the low carb!
5.0,"We loved this.  I have to admit though, that I added basil and oregano from the garden and more salt and pepper."
5.0,This was a major hit in our home.   My daughter is a veggiei-hater and she even loved it.  This is a definite future meal in our home again.
5.0,Delicious. Added a little crushed pepper flakes
5.0,"MY HUSBAND LOVED IT, AND BROUGHT SOME FOR LUNCH TO WORK. HE TOLD AND SHOWED IT OFF . ANOTHER GUY WANTED RECEIPE.I DID ADD PEPPERONI ONTOP WITH WITH ITALIAN STYLE-SIX CHEESE BLEND -AS FINISHING TOUCH.EVEN LOOKED BETTER..."
5.0,Love this casserole - great way to use up summer zucchini - I have made several - so we have some in the freezer for later!
5.0,This was a big hit with my family.  It&#39;s definitely worth giving it a try!!!
5.0,This was amazing! Draining the water out of the zucchini was more time consuming.. plan for atleast 15 minutes. I added fresh basil on top. All 3 kids and my husband LOVED it!
5.0,"Very Very good - followed the advice from other comments... I let the zucchini sit for 30 minutes and squeezed out by the handful, added 1/2 lb of mild Italian sausage and pepperoni&#39;s on top..  Even better the next day."
5.0,So good and so easy! Wonderful way to use zucchini.
5.0,Excellent recipe. Will definitely make again.
5.0,"This is a fabulous way to use up extra zucchini!!  I double the meat/tomato mixture as my husband and boys needed a meatier dish.  I didn&#39;t have italian tomato sauce and have found that one big can of Hunt&#39;s Spaghetti sauce is perfect for the doubled mixture.  I agree, it is even better the next day."
5.0,"Excellent.  I didn&#39;t think my husband would like this, be he did!!  He thought it would make a good dip.  It truly is a unique way to use zucchini, and it was delicious.  Good leftover, too."
5.0,"This was delicious. I substituted pizza sauce for the tomato sauce, and used pepperoni instead of ground beef. Yummy! Leftovers were great!"
5.0,Very good!!!!!  I wish I had this recipe at the beginning of zucchini season.  Will definitely make again.  Three people ate all most the whole dish!!!!  I let the zucchini set with the salt a good 20 minutes.  I used some of my homemade salsa and homemade spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce.  I also topped with some of my pickled Hungarian waxed peppers.  Excellent flavor.
5.0,"I seen this recipe on here last year and have made it several times now. My husband loves it so much I even had to buy zucchini from the store during the winter months and into summer till the zucchini was ready again. Once when I had been canning some homemade pasta sauce, I had a bit left over in the refrigerator and decided to use that in place of the tomato sauce, it was excellent. Also, have used leftover taco meat. That was good too. Thanks!!!"
5.0,"After I wrote my review I was reading all the others and quite a few was talking about it being watery. First, let it stand about 20-30 minutes then squeeze it out by handfuls, that really helps, but I found if I baked the crust about 30-35 minutes or longer before adding the sauce makes for a firmer crust. Love it!"
5.0,very good!!!
5.0,"Excellent!!  It has already become a family favorite, &amp; I&#39;ve made it several times.  I added some pizza seasoning to the sauce to make it take even more pizza-y."
5.0,"I wasn&#39;t sure that my family would go for this one, but my two worst critics, the husband and the picky son loved it.  I would agree with everyone else that the zucchini needs about 20 min to drain and I took handfuls and squeezed it out and had no problems.  Will be making again soon!!"
5.0,I love zucchini. This casserole is very good and leftovers are good too!
5.0,"So, good"
5.0,Delicious! Added a shredded potato to the zucchini mixture because I didn&#39;t have quite enough zucchini. Also added mushroom. Definately a keeper!
5.0,"Our family loved this!  My husband (not a huge zucchini fan) and my one-year-old son both ate two pieces.  Since my family is smaller, I made it in two pie plates so we could give one away.  Worked perfectly!  I agree with other reviews that the zucchini needs to drain longer - at least 20-30 minutes - to get properly dry.  Otherwise it&#39;s a bit soggy.  Will definitely make again!"
5.0,"Trying to watch my carbs, this is delish! I used pizza sauce and topped it with mushrooms and italian sausage crumbled-yum! Put in containers for lunch this week."
5.0,Used Italian sausage for meat.  Very good use for zucchini.
5.0,My husband and I love this dish! I substitute the hamburger for Italian style ground turkey which gives it more flavor than regular hamburger.
5.0,"This is my new favorite recipe.  I have made this dish about 6 times in the last 4 months.  I use a pound of sausage and a pound of ground beef, cook them both; combine with the spaghetti sauce and than divide.  I use one mixture right away, and freeze the other for a later use.You can also make the zucchini crust a day early and assemble the whole recipe; put it in the fridge, and bake the next day for dinner.This is my new lasagna--and so much cheaper too!"
5.0,"I loved this recipe, but used chopped pepperoni slices to make it really taste like pizza."
5.0,"This recipe is delicious !  I baked the crust for 30 min, replaced the green pepper with green and black olives.  Will definitely make again."
5.0,Made this casserole exactly as the recipe is written - next time tweaked it and used 1/2 hamburger and 1/2 italian sausage only because we like a little more spice.  This is a wonderful recipe - our entire family loved it even my picky father-in-law and our 4 1/2 year old granddaughter.  This is a keeper!
5.0,"I made this late night and everyone loved it. I replaced the ground beef with ground turkey, and added oregano, garlic powder, salt and pepper to the meat sauce."
5.0,"This was so good.  Probably one of the best zucchini recipes I have made.  I didn&#39;t have any green peppers, but used pepperonis on top instead.   I premade the casserole the day before, but waited to put the remaining cheese and pepperonis on top until the last 10 minutes of reheating.   Before I put the pepperonis on top I microwaved them a bit and blotted off the grease.  Then I cut them up and sprinkled them on top."
5.0,This is one of my favorite recipes only I add one can of diced tomatoes and use one small can of sauce instead of the 15 oz can of sauce.
5.0,"Terrific recipe. I did sub my homemade pizza sauce for the tomato sauce because that&#39;s what I had. I left out the cheddar and increased the two other cheeses to make it up.  I also added pepperoni. Will make this again and again, thanks!"
5.0,"This was so good, will make it again. The only thing i did different was used pizza sauce instead of the tomatoe sauce."
5.0,"Absolutely delicious!  My husband said, &#34;It&#39;s a do over.&#34;  He also took the leftovers to work and shared a bite with his supervisor and his co-worker.  They also loved it and requested their own serving next time.  LOL!"
5.0,"I made twice this to take to two different gatherings and everyone that tried it loved it.  I have passed out several copies of the recipe and am still getting requests for it.  I did add a little minced garlic to the sauce, then spinkled on fresh chopped basil and oregano on top before baking. Easy and tasty!"
5.0,"My whole family really liked this recipe.  The only thing I did different was I added some dried oregano and basil to the beef mixture, and crumbled 5 strips of cooked bacon on top along with the green pepper.  I&#39;ll be making this again."
5.0,"Love this recipe, cheesy and delicious! I am always looking for new ways to use zucchini from my garden."
5.0,I did not soak my zucchini and I use tomato sauce with Italian Herbs.  Everyone loved it!
5.0,"Of course, I always have to tweak a recipe, but I did add a bit of basil and marjoram to the meat/tomato sauce mixture. I also added minced garlic. I probably strained the zucchini for about 20 minutes. I probably squeezed 2 cups of liquid out of it. It still seemed wet, but when I mixed it with the cheese, it was almost a little too dry to combine until I mixed the eggs in. I also sliced roma tomatoes, sprinkled with basil, pepper, and salt, on top before adding the top layer of cheese. I&#39;ll definitely make this again."
5.0,"This recipe is quick, easy and delicious.  It&#39;s definitely a favorite for our family.  I&#39;ve shared it with friends and the reviews are the same.  I do have a couple additions that I feel complete the dish[although not necessary] -fresh garlic and fresh basil."
5.0,One of my 12 year olds favorite things! We add a bit more cheese than it calls for. Great for warming up at work the next day!
5.0,What a great recipe!
5.0,I absolutely loved this recipe and so did my husband. It was especially tasty for leftovers the next day. I will definitely make this again!
5.0,"I made this for dinner tonight and everyone loved it even my 6yr old.  Good meal for my diabetic husband, he said it was very filling."
5.0,"I&#39;m not a huge fan of zucchini, but am trying to eat more veggies.  This was wonderful!  I didn&#39;t even taste the zucchini. I made this as is, but it definitely lends itself to experimenting.  Yum!!!"
5.0,All 8 of us loved the flavor! Not hugely filling as is and quite watery from the zucchini.  Next time I made it decided to add 2-3 C. of cooked spaghetti to zucchini/cheese mixture.  Delicious and completely filling.  Have made it several times now and works out great.  Has become a big favorite.
5.0,I really liked this recipe quite a bit.  The flavors were excellent together and I loved the &#34;juiciness&#34; of the dish.  It was delicious.  I added a little crushed red peppers and some mushrooms to the sauce.
5.0,"In place of the 1/2 cup of oil, I used another 1/2 cup of mashed banana. Ate it with a spread of butter on each slice, delish!"
5.0,"I made this bread with one minor twist. I live in FL and I have been collecting fresh mangoes every day on my way to work. I only had one ripe banana and a plethora of ripe ripe mangoes, so I did 114g of ripe banana puree and 114g of fresh mango puree. It turned out super tasty with gorgeous hues. I divided the batter into 4 mini loaves and baked for 40-45 minutes in my mini bread stone pan (until the toothpick came out clean). This way I was able to share the love a little further and pass out mini loaves to my co-workers, neighboors, and friends."
5.0,This is the best recipe for banana bread I&#39;ve ever tried. I&#39;ve used it for over 20 years. It says it doesn&#39;t double well so I tripled it. It makes two large loaves after tripling. My question is can I substitute pumpkin purée for the bananas to make this into pumpkin bread with the appropriate spices? I know I could experiment but I&#39;d rather ask first. Thank you.
5.0,"<p>Super delicious! I had a feeling that with so many positive reviews it would be a hit. It&#39;s a challenge to find a dish that my entire family enjoys (kids ages 4 and 8, husband and myself)- but this was a winner! Creamy, hearty, perfect for a cold fall evening. Will be in my normal rotation!</p>"
5.0,This is a fantastic recipe.  I make double batches of it and freeze in seal-a-meal bags for hunting/fishing trips.
5.0,This is a fantastic recipe.  I make double batches of it and freeze in seal-a-meal bags for hunting/fishing trips.
5.0,"<p>Great flavor, fast and easy to prepare. Will add another can of beans or some frozen carrots next time.</p>"
5.0,"Great flavor, fast and easy to prepare. Will add another can of beans or some frozen carrots next time. "
5.0,<p>My husband and I love this recipe!  We make it often!</p>
5.0,"Loved this!  I would like to try adding fresh spinach to this next time.  I used Italian seasoned gr. turkey.  I also sauteed the chopped onion with the gr. pepper I also added some fresh basil to the turkey, onion and gr pepper mix.  I used a nice marinar sauce from Trade Joes and did put black olives in under the top layer of cheese."
5.0,Very good - my family loved it.  I used half spagetti sauce and half It talian tomato sauce and then added italian seasoning to give it a little extra kick.  I will definately make this again.
5.0,Followed advice to be sure zucchini is very dry and used italian sausage instead of hamburger.  This was awesome!  A definite keeper for my family.
5.0,"I didn&#39;t use the salt, just let it set for about 30 minutes like another review said to do.  I added a little bit of oregano and basil to the tomato sauce since I didn&#39;t have Italian tomato sauce.  I might cut back just a little on the cheese.  Taste was excellent.  Will be freeze zucchini so I can have this during the winter months."
5.0,Made this for my family and everyone loved it awesome recipe
5.0,LOVE this recipe! Low carb (I&#39;m diabetic) and so easy to sub lowfat ingredients.I made mine with low fat cheeses and ground turkey breast. Everyone loved it!
5.0,My family loved it!  Let the zucchini dry longer and omitted the salt.  Next time my family asked me to add mushrooms.  It was delicious!
5.0,"Deliciousness surpassed our expectations.  Made it last night and can&#39;t wait till we have it leftover tomorrow night.  Used Italian sausage in place of burger, and added a few banana pepper rings to the top.  My husband said to be sure and write &#34;keeper&#34; before filing it away.  I would serve this to company."
5.0,I have made this twice so far and my family and neighbors love it.
5.0,Absolutely wonderful!!! I substituted pizza sauce for the tomato sauce since this is a pizza recipe. I also added the onion along with the green pepper as pizza is normally made. I gave the recipe to 6 people the first day I made it for work.
5.0,This was super!!  My four kids came home from sports practice and loved it -- even the one who doesn&#39;t like zucchini.  I doubled the ground beef and used a can of spaghetti sauce.  I cooked onion and peppers with the meat.  I added a layer of pepperoni on top the meat layer.  I did not have cheddar cheese so omitted that.  It was fantastic. I think I will try low fat cheese next time.  It is an excellent way to use up zucchini!!
5.0,"Some one gave me three zucchinis and this was one of the recipes I tried, it was delicious. Looking forward to making it again."
5.0,Very simple and tasty.  I think I might experiment with more toppings next time.
5.0,"whole family loves this casserole, many come back for seconds"
5.0,Easy and delicious! I added some leftover mushrooms to the beef and onions and some black pepper.
5.0,"Wonderful, delicious, versatile, can&#39;t wait to make it again.  The zucchini crust is fantastic.  The key is to squeeze all the liquid out and then squeeze it again.  You can make this any way you like your pizza. It also reheats very well for left-overs.  Thanks for this great recipe."
5.0,"I used spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce and it worked great! Also, I omited the cheddar cheese and it was still delicious."
5.0,My husband &amp; I loved this recipe. I used Putanesca Spaghetti sauce and it was fabulous. I will be making it for our family picnic.
5.0,I made this for my family and they loved it. I will definetely make it again.
5.0,This was wonderful.  My husband raved about it at work and had people request the recipe.
5.0,I made this for my family several months ago. Delicious !!!!! I have made it 4 more times since then. My husband raves about it and my teenage son eats the zucchini with no complaints. 5 stars from us
5.0,"Have not made this recipe yet, but sounds really delish! My neighbor has an abundance of zucchini, while I only planted two plants this year. I will definitely print her out a copy of this recipe! Has anyone tried throwing in some sliced or chunked pepperoni too? Once I make the recipe as directed, I always &#34;tweek&#34; it, so I may add some pepperoni the second time. I know my family will love this recipe. Can&#39;t wait to make it and will report back : ) I may also make one for my son who went back to college, and is living in an apt. near campus. He and his room mates would love this : )"
5.0,I use pizza sauce instead of tomato sauce and I added chopped onions ... it&#39;s so delicious and burst of flavors
5.0,"For those worried about the sodium content, you don&#39;t need to sprinkle the zucchini with salt.  Let it stand for 1/2 hour &amp; then wring it out really well.  It will be just as good as sprinkling with salt.  Any recipe that has this much cheese will have a high sodium content, as cheese is loaded with salt.  No need adding more if you can help it!"
5.0,My family LOVED this recipe! We will definitely will make this again....sooner than later.
5.0,My husband and I love this recipe!  We make it often!
5.0,This has been a family favorite for years.

5.0,My family loves this!  I&#39;ve altered it only a bit.  Instead of heavy cream I just use regular milk because I always have it on hand.  It tastes the same.  Great recipe!

5.0,"Absolutely AWESOME! I&#39;ve been making this since I first saw it in the magazine years ago. I&#39;ve sometimes used pinto beans instead of white beans to save money, and adjusted the heat level depending on who would be eating it, but I always have people beg for the recipe!"

5.0,Everyone love it. We served it with olives and sour cream on the side. Yum!
5.0,Has anyone tried freezing one?
5.0,This is a fantastic recipe. Great way to use zucchini. Wasn&#39;t much left for leftovers!
5.0,"Delicious!  My family&#39;s response, &#34;you better double this next time.&#34;  Great way to get those veggies in for people who may not like zucchini.  We did make one change, used pork sausage instead of ground beef."
5.0,This is one of my favorite ways to use fresh zucchini and the abundance of banana peppers from the garden!
5.0,"Went together well, tasted great!  I would be very sure to really squeeze out the shredded zucchini.  Mine was a little too moist, but still was great!"
5.0,This was an awesome recipe.  I used mushrooms instead of the green pepper and am going to try some pepperoni next time.  A keeper!
5.0,"Love it, and I don&#39;t like zucchini! Actually used some Thai squash I had no idea what to do with. Tried some of the suggestions, the sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms and really like the result!"
5.0,"This was amazing!  I have been looking for recipes that taste delicious, but don&#39;t have the typical carbs (like pizza crust or lasagna noodles) and this was perfect.  I will be adding this to my list of favorites for sure!"
5.0,I made this and the next day it was all gone. Love it!!
5.0,"Delicious!! I don&#39;t care for zucchini or hamburger, but this was great! You can mostly taste cheese (yum). Also, depending on how you fix up the tomato sauce, it adds nice flavor (I added some red pepper as suggested). I also liked the green peppers on top- the crispness was a nice contrast.I would liken the bottom layer to an egg bake consistency and taste."
5.0,"This dish is &#34;to die for&#34;.  We did not plant garden this year, but our neighbor provided us with an ample supply of zucchini.**Sincerely**"
5.0,I found this recipe as I had some fresh zucchini to use up.  It turned out wonderful!!!It is definitely a keeper.  My husband and toddler both loved it.   The only thing I did different was sauteed my onion and green pepper and then cooked my meat and used my favorite spaghetti sauce.  It was absolutely delicious!
5.0,WE HAVE MADE THIS ZUCCHINI PIZZA CASSEROLE 3 TIMES ALREADY THIS SUMMER. WE LOVED IT. COULD PROBABLY FREEZE SOME GRATED ZUCCHINI AND MAKE IT THIS WINTER TOO. THANKS FROM NEBRASKA
5.0,This was really a great way to use up the zucchini in the garden.  It was delicious.  Because my family really likes cheddar cheese I used a cup of cheddar on the top with the mozzarella.  Everyone enjoyed it.  I also made just the base without the top and served it with a chicken dinner.  Went over well.
5.0,Absolutely delicious! Fantastic as leftovers also!!
5.0,"Made this tonight. DH says &#39;it&#39;s a keeper&#39;!My Changes: I used frozen shredded zucchini, so didn&#39;t need the salt to draw the water.Sauteed the green pepper with beef and onion.Sprinkled sliced ripe olives on top of the meat sauce, before putting on the cheeses.When cheeses melted as it cooked, the olives peeked thru. Will be making this again. Hope somebody gives us zucchini as i thought we had so much frozen from last year that we didn&#39;t plant any this year.  Jan."
5.0,"This was very tasty! I didn&#39;t have Italian tomato sauce, so I cooked the ground beef &amp; onion with 2 cloves minced garlic, 1/2 tsp basil &amp; oregano, some salt, crushed red pepper &amp; paprika.  I only used 1 can of tomato sauce and added a can of extremely well drained (I actually squeezed handfuls out) diced tomatoes. Delish!"
5.0,This was very good.  I think next time I will use some spicy chicken sausage instead of the ground beef. It was a nice alternative to our regular zucchini dishes
5.0,I tried this out for a potluck dish. Everyone enjoyed &amp; was wanting the recipe! Will make again.
5.0,Wow!  This recipe is very delicious!  I made a couple of changes by using Italian sausage instead of hamburger and I added hot peppers to the top.  I like spicey food so it turned out perfectly.  Will definately make this again.  Thanks.
5.0,"This is delicious and I love that it uses an entire big zucchini.  My whole family loved it and I will make it again.  I thought the bottom was a little soft and next time I make it, I will try adding a couple tablespoons of cornmeal to the zucchini mixture with the hopes of it becoming like polenta.MaryLynHope"
5.0,"I treated just like a pizza and added to the top mushrooms, onions, the green pepper and turkey pepperoni.  It was great!!  I took it to a dog show and came home with an empty dish.  To make it healthy I used Turkey pepperoni and turkey sausage and pizza sauce instead of tomato sauce."
5.0,"I have made this several times over the years. It&#39;s delicious as is; I usually halve it for our smaller family. Also, it&#39;s delicious to bake the zucchini base, and sprinkle on top diced chicken, green and red peppers, onion, olives, and salsa to taste (I use about 1 cup for half the recipe) to make a mexican pizza. Yum!"
5.0,This is a great way to use all that zucchini from the garden! Yum!!!
5.0,"We thought this chili was absolutely fantastic. My husband said he would take this to his next chili cook off at work. Although the chili was great it was a bit too spicy for the younger ones in my family, but to be fair they really don&#39;t eat anything with any spiciness at all. we will make this again and again."

5.0,<p>Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
5.0,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5.0,I didn&#39;t have the beans so I made it without &amp; it was more like a soup. It was delicious. I will definitely make this again. And again and again. :)

5.0,"This chili is really good. I add milk instead of whipping cream (I think the whipping cream is too sweet), only one can of chilies, and 1 cup grated cheddar cheese right before serving. My husband said it tasted amazing!"
5.0,"I&#39;ve made this lasagna several times, and it is fantastic.  This is now my go-to lasagna recipe for special occasions. I&#39;ve made it for Christmas Eve a few times, and am planning to make it again this year for Christmas Day. I love this recipe."
5.0,"Amazing recipe!! My husband’s family loves their Italian food, and I was so nervous to make dinner for them. I found this recipe and have never looked back! The only thing I do different is I have equal parts of ricotta and cottage cheese (about 2 cups each), as we prefer a thicker consistency to really hold it together. Thank you so much!"
5.0,"As with any recipe one tends to adjust to their own taste. That being said TOH altered my original submission of this recipe!  I don&#39;t do all those layers and use only 2 layers of noodles (6 total). I continue to adjust my recipe twenty years later! Isn&#39;t that what all cooks do as we learn?  One thing I will say is you must use fresh ingredients to get the best results - like shred the mozzarella (preshredded cheese contains chemicals that keep the cheese from caking and DOES affect the results). Also, don&#39;t use cheap ingredients (garbage in garbage out). If you use pre-processed ingredients don&#39;t blame the recipe!!   I recently found a true Italian grocery and used their home made goat cheese ricotta and was amazed at the difference that made!  In regards to the sauce-I have learned that weather (like humidity) actually makes a difference. I purposely make a thick sauce so the layers &#34;stay in place&#34; as I dislike runny lasagne. Again, personal preference!  Thank you all for your comments and enjoy!!!"
5.0,I’ve made this 3 times now - I love this recipe it’s delicious!
5.0,"Tastes delicious, &#34;Traditional&#34; or not."
5.0,"I&#39;ve been making this lasagna for many years, since I first discovered it in a Taste of Home cookbook.  It&#39;s delicious and worth the effort!  I&#39;ve tried other lasagnas, but they don&#39;t compare to this one!"
5.0,"Absolutely delicious! Everyone loved it. Was wondering if anyone has made ahead and froze, if so any advice?"
5.0,"I&#39;ve been making this lasagna for years, ever since I saw it in one of the contest winner books. I especially love the meat sauce, which I use for other recipes now. I have since been required to go gluten free (Celiac), but I&#39;ve adapted it to the gluten free noodles. This is just delicious."
5.0,I followed exactly. I found the sauce to acidic from the tomato paste so I added more sugar and adjusted seasonings. There was plenty of meat sauce and so my 9x13 pan was filled to the top as described. I did use no boil noodles with excellent results.  The recipe turned out delicious. Why others didn&#39;t like it is just personal opinion. The recipe is a keeper.
5.0,"<p>This is quite literally, the BEST recipe I have ever found.  I am looking it up for the 30th time as it has been requested for a birthday dinner tomorrow.  By now, I should have it memorized! It does NOT disappoint. </p>"
5.0,Love the use of provolone cheese. I added a little more sauce.
5.0,I ran across this recipe and it reminded me of my older cousins lasagne. Once I made it the first time it became my go to guide on layering and the cottage cheese ands ricotta sauce.. .I use my own recipe for the sauce and I think the next time I&#39;ll make it how I did as a young adult with burgundy in it.  Oh so good
5.0,Love
5.0,I don&#39;t care if this is traditional Italian lasagna or not. What is important to me is that it tastes good. This looks like my long lost recipe for lasagna that I made in the 70&#39;s. I got it off a box of pasta. I am so glad to have found it again. I can&#39;t wait to make it.
5.0,"I&#39;ve made this recipe for years and it has always been a big hit.  This recipe screams traditional, american lasagna in the very best way.  It&#39;s very difficult to mess this one up as I have not always had every ingredient it calls for on hand (provolone, sausage, ricotta, etc).  I love seeing how everyone has put their own spin on it and it still comes out beautifully."
5.0,Best ever !
5.0,I finally got to make this recipe to the t and it is amazing! My little girl who doesn’t eat any kind of combined foods loves it and asked me to make some again tonight. Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe!
5.0,"I spent two years in the Toscana region of Italy. The Italian snobs in here have no CLUE that this is actually BETTER than any lasagna to be found in Firenze (Florence), Bologna, or Milano (Milan). Cottage cheese? My first thought was ARE YOU KIDDING ME? But after trying it, I will concur that it is BETTER than ricotta alone. SALUD!"
5.0,Best lasagna ever! My family loves it 
5.0,Edit to my last review : Change cans of sauce to Ro&#39;s SENSITIVE Jar sauce
5.0,This is the 3rd time I have made this recipe and my family loves and I use the sauce as any marinara sauce I need.  A question to the author and readers.  I just caught today the recipe calls for 3   8 oz cans of sauce.  I had never noticed they were 8 oz cans and have been using the standard 15 1/2 . I  could not imagine this with less.  Was the 8 oz cans a typo or is that how everyone has been preparing?  Regardless of the answer I will stick to the 3 larger cans but I am curious.
5.0,"This recipe is amazing and worth 5 stars. It is very close to a secret family recipe I have used for more than 50 years. Yes, you can use no boil noodles...if you must, but don’t give this recipe a low rating if you do and find it didn’t quite meet your expectations. Make the recipe using the ingredients as written. You won’t be sorry."
5.0,"This is just what lasagna should taste like, rich and delicious and like a warm food hug ! The sauce is incredible, even more so after adding a 1/4 cup of red wine! Added lots more tomato sauce after reading other reviews and it definitely was needed. Worth the effort to put such a tasty dish out for the family :)"
5.0,"Awesome base recipe. I didn&#39;t have provolone so just used extra mozzarella, will try provolone next time. I also added mushrooms and an onion. This was so yummy."
5.0,"Absolutely the best lasagne I have ever eaten. Hands down, will never make another recipe....truly fantastic!"
5.0,"I have made this recipe since it appeared 18 years ago, it is absolutely the best. No matter what the negative reviews say, just try it and make it EXACTLY as it is written. I was skeptical but after making it ..the family loved it hands down and i&#39;m a particular cook. Make it and try it...you&#39;re family will love it!"
5.0,Delicious!!!
5.0,"Lasagna is not a dish that originated in Italy.  So this is American Lasagna and it&#39;s delicious - it uses cottage cheese which is not as gritty as ricotta can be.  Lasagna comes from the Greeks - I actually make a Greek lasagna better known as Pastitsio it is layered pasta with ground beef  but when I want American Lasagna I make this recipe.   Did you know the Brits actually found a recipe for Lasagna from the 1390&#39;s?  Each country has perfected their own claim to Lasagna fame.  When the Italians make it in Northern Italy they do not use ricotta cheese, they use a creamy cheese sauce known as besciamella.  Ricotta is used in the Southern region only, this is why many Italians in America use ricotta - most are descendants from Southern Italians.  So even Mario or Giada is making it wrong if you are from Tuscany."
5.0,I was so surprised by how delicious this lasagna turned out to be.  I&#39;ve now made it 3 times and now it&#39;s my favorite!  I made it exactly as written.
5.0,Absolutely  delicious! This was the best lasagna I have ever made! The tomato sauce was amazing. I made it exactly as written. I thought the seasoning would be a tad bland as it didn&#39;t seem like enough for the amount of sauce. I was wrong. It was perfect just the way it was. I haven&#39;t used sausage in my lasagna before and it will now be my norm!!!!!!  This will be my go-to recipe from now on! Thanks Taste of Home!
5.0,This recipe is absolutely amazing. I found this recipe 4 years ago when I had moved out on my own into my new house. This is my fourth time making it and it seems to get better every time!!!!! Good job taste of home!
5.0,"I changed 3 things,  no sugar, used ricotta cheese"
5.0,Love it! I typically use more ricotta and less cottage cheese because it&#39;s hard to find an 8 oz. container of ricotta. I prefer Italian sausage to plain pork sausage. Glad there is no onion because my daughter can&#39;t tolerate them. Yum!
5.0,"I was wary using pork sausage, but what a great flavor it added to this dish! This was a big hit with the family."
5.0,This is wonderful. The addition of provolone cheese make it.
5.0,"This is, truly, a 5-star recipe!  The best lasagna that I have ever eaten!  The only tweak that I made was substituting seasoning salt for regular salt.  Besides that, I followed it to a &#34;T&#34; .  The whole family raved about it.  Thanks for another winner :)"
5.0,"Look no further, by far the best lasagna recipe.  Easy and delicious."
5.0,I don&#39;t usually write reviews but I just had to! I did add a cup of Cabernet red wine to the sauce but other than that kept to the recipe! My husband isn&#39;t much on pasta but he RAVED about this lasagna on the 3 bite and went back for seconds! It was truly delicious! I think I will make it for our family Christmas this year.
5.0,"This is hands down the best lasagna recipe I have ever tried.  My husband and sons both loved it!  The recipe was very simple and I was worried that it would not be very flavorful, but this was perfect.  The sauce was amazing and the cheese mixture was fantastic.  Many lasagna recipes turn out very runny, but the cheese mixture in this was just right.  I used the lasagna noodles that don&#39;t require cooking and made sure to allow the lasagna to sit on the counter for 15 minutes before cutting.  This will now be our lasagna recipe from now on!  Thank you for sharing Lorri!"
5.0,Omg! This recipe is amazing!! I followed all the directions and it was delicious!! Thank you!
5.0,We love this recipe.  Amazing!
5.0,"Wow, Susan, that is so rude to rate a recipe that you didn’t even bother to try because you are some kind of lasagna snob.  If the recipe is “beneath your standards”, just pass on by and find recipes more to your liking.  Some of us are more interested in the food than in the tradition you use to make YOUR lasagna."
5.0,"I was using a different lasagna recipe on this site, but having tried this one, there&#39;s no going back. I made it exactly as stated, but I used mild Italian sausages (out of their casings) and a full package of SMOKED provolone. This was one decadent, cheesy, saucy, meaty lasagna, and I have had nothing but rave reviews from friends and family, and requests to please make this again. Best ever."
5.0,Took a HUGE chance and made this for the first time for our Christmas dinner and it was wonderful!!!  It looked intimidating with such a long list of ingredients but it went seamlessly.  I was also afraid it had too much cheese in it but I couldn&#39;t (and wouldn&#39;t) change a thing.  A keeper for sure!!
5.0,"Best I have ever, ever had !!! Soooooo good."
5.0,Best ever!
5.0,"This is the best lasagna ever. I don&#39;t use pork sausage, I just add a few fennel seeds to my sauce to give a little sausage flavor."
5.0,"This chili is really good. I add milk instead of whipping cream (I think the whipping cream is too sweet), only one can of chilies, and 1 cup grated cheddar cheese right before serving. My husband said it tasted amazing!"
5.0,I doubled this recipe and made it for a pumpkin-carving party we had recently.  The Chili was delicious.  Our guests raved and requested the recipe.

5.0,This is definately a new family favorite.  My  4 kids loved this as much as I did not to mention my picky husband.  
5.0,Really great traditional recipe! Exactly what you need when you want a true down home Lasagna recipe!
5.0,Finally I have an amazing lasagna recipe. Made this just recently and everyone raved. I had leftovers the next day and it even tasted better. And Emily I&#39;m sorry but  you had to do something wrong to give it negative reviews.
5.0,"I have been making this recipe for years, year-round. It can&#39;t be beat. When I don&#39;t have ricotta it&#39;s still wonderful."
5.0,Made this today for all of my family..Everyone loved it! Thanks for sharing the recipe?
5.0,"Made this yesterday. I used 24 oz. pasta sauce with basil instead of plain tomato sauce. I also added 1t oregano. Used non-boil lasagna. Assembled everything a day ahead and cooked it 50 minutes and refrigerated it (covered tightly). The next day, I warmed it 20 minutes at 250 and 10 minutes at 350 until the edges bubbled a bit. It was a huge hit. Next time I will use real mozzarella cheese and shred it myself, but this time I didn&#39;t have the energy for that. I think it will make it a 6 star if it has real cheese instead of the prepacked shredded cheese, which has fillers. This photo is a bit deceptive. My pan was filled to the top."
5.0,"Made this last week, it was the best lasagna I have ever made!  So said hubby.  Only changes I made was to use Italian sausage instead of the pork, and no boil noodles.  I did add about a cup of water to the sauce to provide enough moisture for the noodles. The recipe is a keeper!  Yes, it takes longer to cook, but so worth the effort!"
5.0,This has to be the best lasagna i have ever had. Only thing i changed is i used 1lb hot Italian sausage and 1/2lb gr beef. Amazing flavors. I love the provolone in this. This is my first time not popping a jar for the sauce and i will never go back. Thank you for sharing this recipe
5.0,This will be my go to lasagna from now on.  Perfect!  Served it Christmas Eve to rave reviews from family and friends.
5.0,One of the best lasagna&#39;s  I&#39;ve had. I changed the beef and pork to only italian sausage. It was delicious!
5.0,"Love, love, love this recipe!! It is so delicious, everyone raves over it. Will never make another lasagna recipe....ever!"
5.0,"Yes, must agree.  One of the best I have ever tried!  Did leave out the cottage cheese , though.  Added extra ricotta instead.  Delicious!"
5.0,"This recipe is very similar to one called &#34;My Famous Cheesy, Heavy-duty Lasagna&#34;.  The one difference is the meat.  I used 1 1/2 lbs.  ground chuck and 1/4 lb. bulk Italian pork sausage with 1/2 diced onion added to the meats then drained off the grease.  I also used 3-16oz cans Hunts tomato sauce and 1  6oz. can tomato paste. I used 2 tsp. of Italian seasoning and 1/2 tsp. salt.  For the cheese I used a 16 oz. block of mozzarella-shredded by hand instead of the 12 oz. in the recipe.  I also added a pkg. of Kraft Italian 5-cheese finely grated to the top when it is uncovered.  I baked at 350 degrees for 60 minutes, then uncovered and baked 15 minutes more with the added cheese.  This is a very good lasagna recipe, but be sure to bake in a lasagna pan as it does not fit into a 13 X 9 pan!"
5.0,"I made this for my husband&#39;s birthday, and the family loved it. My sons-in-law wanted seconds and some to take home. I made two recipes worth so that I could do that. I&#39;m thankful that the note said that the pan would be &#34;full&#34;; I was concerned, but it fit and there was no boil over. I especially enjoyed the layer of provolone cheese; that was something I had not seen in any other recipe."
5.0,"This recipe is very good added a few ingredients to this recipe, I added 1/4 cup of fried fennel, 1/2 cup of caramelized onion, a pound if fried muhrooms and some extra virgin Olive oil and 2 14 oz cans of fire roasted dice tomatoes, I only used one small can of tomato pasteTurned out excellent with a very zesty taste to the sauce -----YUM"
5.0,This is the best lasagna I have ever eaten. It took a little time to put together but it was worth every minute to assemble
5.0,"Made this for my son&#39;s soccer team, and again for a dinner party with my husband&#39;s work colleagues, and both times I received rave reviews for this dish.  Even my picky 9-year old loved this lasagna. This will be my go-to recipe for lasagna!"
5.0,"This lasagna is really yummy, I substituted spicy Italian sausage and a bottle of garlic meat tomato sauce instead of plain tomato sauce. As well as Italian flavored tomato paste since I dont have Italian seasoning. One thing that I blundered on was the garlic. Ive never cooked with garlic before so I accidently put 2 whole garlic bulbs instead of 2 cloves so it was very garlicy. Still yummy though and would be 10x better with the recipe amount. Im on my mobile and the star selection is acting up so in case it doesnt say this-  5 stars for this lasagna!"
5.0,"Very good Lasagna, I used ground turkey instead of hamburger and could not tell the difference. I missed the ricotta cheese but the recipe was quite good without it. My 9x13 pan was full without the ricotta. I also had 2 cups of extra sauce left over."
5.0,Okay so I substituted garlic for the powder. And also the beef for ground turkey and instead of spicy sausage I used mild and it was great well the meat sauce. I have my lasagna in the ovenext right now but I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be great. :)
5.0,"<p>I absolutely Love it!!!! Ive made this the first time with beef and mild italian sausage, this time i used ground turkey and mild italian sausage i actuallu think i liked it better this time(and i normally Hate ground turkey) I did tweek it though.  Instead of mozzarella and provolone I use a 5 or 6 cheese Italian blend. I also use sharp, Jack and Colby. I use 15 ounces of ricotta and two eggs instead of three. Today I added a little chicken broth to loosen it up a bit. It wasn&#39;t soupy!!!! The seasonings I changed up a bit too, in addition to Italian I used a complete sazon seasoning, and adobo. CLassico traditional sause and diced tomatoes with oregano and Basil.  I Sauteed garlic and shallots.  I love love love the cottage cheese, it gives the ricotta a little kick. I must now use that cheese mixture in some homemade ravioli!!!!!!  Yummmm</p>"
5.0,"I&#39;ve made this lasagna several times now. Love it! Last night I served it to my dinner guests, and even the person who said he HATED lasagna ate a great big helping. This really does make a lot, so I suggest that you use a nice deep lasagna pan. I made some simple additions to suit our tastes: a half cup of diced onions sauteed with the meat, a 10 ounce jar of sliced mushrooms (drained), and I increased the sausage to one pound. I also increased the tomato sauce to 30 ounces. Extra mozzarella on every layer. Perfecto! Helpful hints: Add the top layer of cheese after you uncover the lasagna so it doesn&#39;t stick to the foil. And in response to several questions about the sausage, recommendations are to use ground Italian sausage, NOT pork breakfast sausage or sausage links. I made the mistake of using pork breakfast sausage the first time I made this and the taste totally overwhelmed it. Yikes"
5.0,Always a hit with this recipe. It also freezes well.
5.0,"How do you freeze this, cooked or uncooked.????"
5.0,This is my go-to lasagna.  I really like the sauce. I use mild Italian sausage instead of bulk pork sausage and usually make a double recipe.  I save the extra to use on spaghetti. It&#39;s a great recipe for entertaining. I make all the components ahead and just assemble and bake.
5.0,"This is hands down, the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever tried. My family is crazy about it. Wonderful recipe!!"
5.0,Best lasagna ever!
5.0,YUM! Perfect recipe! Thank you! This was my first lasanga attempt! Your recipe was flawless!
5.0,EX !!!!!.
5.0,"Made this for my date this weekend and it was amazing. He doesn&#39;t eat red meat so I replaced the ground beef with Morning Star Crumbles and replaced the pork sausage with Morningstar Farms Original Sausage. Bought all Horizon cheeses and made it completely &#39;humane&#39; (animals used in recipe were organically fed, free range, and humanely slaughtered). It was delicious!!!"
5.0,"Best ever! Pauline, Nova Scotia"
5.0,.
5.0,I&#39;ve been making this recipe for years &amp; i always get request for the recipe. I found a cheese maker that makes extra sharp provolone cheese.If you can find it it&#39;s well worth using in this recipe. It gives it sharper bite &amp; tang you don&#39;t get with regular provolone
5.0,"I hadn&#39;t made lasagna in a very long time so I decided to look up a recipe. I tried this one and it came out excellent. Based on the other reviews, I did add 2 lbs of meat (I used ground turkey instead of beef) instead of 1lb. and therefore used twice the amount of tomato sauce to compensate for the extra meat. I also used a deeper pan and made 3 layers instead of two. Everyone thought it was delicious and I will definitely make it again. Thanks!"
5.0,This is the best lasagna I have ever had! I use the no cook noodles and it&#39;s great !
5.0,"I had doubts that this was going to turn out because the sauce ended up very thick.  It was almost like a paste, and I wasn&#39;t even able to simmer it for the whole hour because I was afraid it was going to burn.  However, the lasagna still tasted excellent even with the very thick sauce.  I think the next time, I will maybe use a can of diced tomatoes in place of one of the cans of sauce.  Also, I would wait to add the last layer of mozzarella cheese until after you uncover it, because most of the top layer of cheese ended up on the foil when I removed it.  I also used the no-cook noodles for this, and they came out great!"
5.0,Made it for Canada Day - my guests loved it!
5.0,Best I ever made or ate.
5.0,I am a terrible cook and I found this to be easy and delicious! I would definitely recommend it!
5.0,My husband made this Lasagna last night and it was SO delicious and by far the best lasagna we have ever eaten - other recipes don&#39;t even come close!  We have 3 young children who all raved over it and our daughter even brought some to school in her thermos for lunch.  It made plenty for a family of 5 - still have a few pieces left over but they won&#39;t make it till the end of the day!  My husband ate 3 pieces for dinner on his own!  Grab some Italian bread and make this recipe - you&#39;ll be so happy you did!   10 YUMMY STARS!!!!  :)
5.0,"This was fantastic! I didnt add any salt, but other than that, I didn&#39;t change a thing."
5.0,"There were 8 of us for dinner and we finished the entire pan! DH asked if we could make it again in January.  We used sweet italian sausage, a 29 oz can of tomato sauce, and an additional 15 oz can of diced tomatoes. We did have some sauce that wouldn&#39;t fit in the pan, however, so the extra sauce and tomatoes were probably not necessary. We&#39;ll probably do it as written next time."
5.0,"Oh my gosh, is this good!  Love the layer of provolone!  And this is the first time I made lasagna with both cottage and ricotta cheese.  I added a little more ricotta than the recipe calls for, and it turned out sooooooo good!  This is my new lasagna recipe!"
5.0,"I must say, I was surprised how well this turned out. Every lasagna recipe I&#39;ve ever tried always came out on the flavorless side, but this recipe did not. Everyone was surprised that there was cottage cheese in the lasagna, which I feel helps the taste. Granted, I had to adjust the ingredients a little since a person in my family has sensitivities to what is in Italian seasoning, but a pepper and onion sausage and a little extra salt and sugar did the trick with the sauce.Definitely a keeper."
5.0,This was easy to make and SO good.....it&#39;s a keeper !
5.0,"wonderful lasagna, I too used oven ready lasagna perfect!"
5.0,This is absolutely delicious. Only change I did was use half cottage cheese and half ricotta of the total 32 ounces of both.
5.0,"This is by far the best lasagna I have ever made, and quite possibly the best I&#39;ve ever eaten (restaurants included!)  One thing I really like about the recipe is the step-by-step layering directions. They make it very easy to put this delicious dish together!"
5.0,Yummy!!!  My family requests this at least once a month if not twice.  Love it!
5.0,"I&#39;ve made at least 50 different versions of lasagna, this is hands down, the best by far.  I followed the recipe."
5.0,This lasagna was awesome if you are a cheese lover this is the recipe for you. I added chopped onion and mushrooms in and let them saute with the meat because I like more than just meat in my sauce and the flavor was to die for! Hands down best lasagna I have ever made:)
5.0,I am coming back online again to get this recipe.  I have tried other recipes over the years but always come back to this one when I am having company and want my lasagna to taste just right!
5.0,"I used 2 lbs of hamburger, 1 lb of Italian sausage and added an additional 15 oz. of tomato sauce.  My family loved it, in fact my husband said this is the best dish ever!  Will definitely make it again."
5.0,Perfect.
5.0,I just followed the recipe as given and it was a big hit. I might try a little more of the meat sauce next time.
5.0,Best lasagna in the world!
5.0,My family loved this lasagna!  So so so good!!
5.0,I&#39;ve made this delicious recipe before and am going to try making five trays of it this weekend for a big gathering.  This time I&#39;m going to try oven-ready lasagna noodles to save time.  Keeping my fingers crossed that it will work.  Has anyone else tried these noodles?
5.0,Loved it! My boyfriend said it was the best lasagna he&#39;s ever had and that&#39;s saying something!
5.0,I have a question do you remove the skins from the sausages or cook them whole or cut up
5.0,Made this for dinner tonight.... It was awesome!!!!
5.0,"Made this for dinner last night; I must say one of the Best lasagna I have ever had or made.  Followed the recipe, with few changes; added 2/3 cup red wine to the sauce to make it a little more saucier and used no cook lasagna noodles.  The second time I made it, had my in laws visiting so made it the day before and took it out of the fridge 4 hours before baking, still as AWESOME as the first time &amp; using the no cook lasagna noodles. This is a keeper in my recipe book.Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe with all of us.Ferryal"
5.0,"I usually go with jar sauce to save time, but wanted to make an extra special dinner for family staying with me. This recipe was awesome, so good, they  could not stop bragging. Thank you Taste of Home!"
5.0,My husband and I really loved this lasagna. The only change I will make is to cut down on the cheese.
5.0,"I&#39;ve been making lasagna for over 40 years for my family, but decided to update the taste and ran across this recipe in Taste of Home a couple years ago. I use this recipe exclusively now. It&#39;s very meaty with the beef and pork and that is the best combination. The seasoning and combination of cheeses is perfect. I had my doubts about the use of cottage cheese, but it cooks down so there are no curds and keeps the lasagna from drying out. I made this a number of times and it comes out perfect every time. I call that foolproof!!"
5.0,THE best lasagna I&#39;ve ever made or eaten! A perfect 10 from the whole family :)
5.0,This is definately a new family favorite.  My  4 kids loved this as much as I did not to mention my picky husband.
5.0,"So good!  This recipe is a regular in our house.  I usually tone down the green chilies to suit my kids&#39; tastes, but it is DELICIOUS!  We always make a double-batch."

5.0,it was so easy to make and very good..thanks to my sister whom makes it all the time..I did add some jack cheese to it the last time I made it.

5.0,"This soup was delicious and easy to make. It is unlike any white chili I have ever had. We did substitute while kidney beans for the great northern beans. We prefer kidney beans--they are a little firmer. And instead of the 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper the recipe calls for, we added 1/4 tsp of chili powder."

5.0,"This is one of my family&#39;s favorite meals- especially my husband&#39;s! It has replaced the traditional chili recipe in our house, and everyone I&#39;ve made it for has loved it."
5.0,"By FAR the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever eaten.  The whole family loved it.  Takes some time to make, but so worth it!"
5.0,Best Lasagna Recipe that I have found.
5.0,the best
5.0,"This was a truly delicious lasagna.  I used hot Italian sausage because my family likes a bit of kick in their meals, but there is really nothing I would change about this recipe.  It is definitely a keeper."
5.0,"I made this yesterday because my in-laws were coming, and everyone liked it a lot! I didn&#39;t change anything, except I used dried parsley instead of fresh (didn&#39;t have fresh).  A definite keeper!  Even my extremely picky 12-year-old cleaned her plate!"
5.0,"I first made this recipe for a New Year&#39;s Day gathering of family &amp; friends in 2010, &amp; it was a hit with everyone!  I substituted 4 cups of Ragu Traditional Spaghetti Sauce for the tomato sauce mixture in order to save time.   I also occasionally substitute sliced or bulk pepperoni for the bulk pork sausage.   We enjoy the variety of cheeses; I&#39;d never seen that before.  It&#39;s a favorite!"
5.0,AWESOME. Quick and easy and very filling. The taste is what made my family a lasagna lover.
5.0,I made this for New Year&#39;s Day dinner and it was a hit! This will be my go to recipe for lasagna. I had Italian sausage so used that instead of the pork sausage and it turned out great.
5.0,"I added some V-8 juice as needed to thin the sauce while it simmered for the hour. I added onion, green pepper, fresh mushrooms, bay leaf, extra garlic, and Italian seasoning. And towards the end of the hour, some fresh basil.To the  layers I added one of fresh spinach. I am SO glad I found this recipe! I have made it twice, once with beef and sausage, and once with beef and plain ground pork. Both were awesome! Thank you for this recipe!"
5.0,"After 44 years of trying to make my husband happy with lasagna, I finally nailed it. I didnt make the sauce sunce Prego is our favorite ( I have made many home made sauces in my cooking career) and we always go back to Prego.  It saves time in the kitchen.  I used Asiago-Parmesan instead of just Pamesan.  EXCELLENT"
5.0,I first tried this recipe from my Taste of Home cookbook a few years back. It has become a family favorite!! It really is easy to make and has such great flavor. I make it a few times during the year. especially during the cold winter months. I&#39;ve also tried it with jar sauce but It&#39;s just not the same  I&#39;ve also used my own homemade sauce from cooking down tomatoes which is to die for!!! I loaned my cookbook to my SIL and have not gotten it back yet so I&#39;m so glad it&#39;s included in the online recipes. My husband has been craving &#34;the best lasagna ever&#34; as he calls it. he&#39;s so right. definitely a 5 star recipe
5.0,"The ricotta cheese is what makes this dish so fantastic. I love to add additional shredded cheese, however, on the top!  Delicious. This also freezes well."
5.0,I too have tried for years to get the perfect lasagna. I found this one last winter and have been making it exactly as it says since.  I printed it off and laminated it. I have been asked many times to share it.  I always have some in the freezer now.  It is so easy to freeze. I wait until the next day and cut it to portion sizes and wrap them individual in saran and then place them in a ziplock bag in freezer.  I often share these portions with seniors and shut-ins.
5.0,"Just began creating this dish, I&#39;ve never made lasagna by myself before so I&#39;m hoping my dad and younger sisters enjoy this for dinner tonight! (Did not have cottage cheese so I doubled up on ricotta... Also did not have provolone :( hopefully it&#39;s still good!)"
5.0,"I made this tonight for my family. My kids just loved it! I had to make it Gluten Free with the no boil Gluten Free noodles. I think next time I will only use ground beef though. Other than that, this is a great recipe!"
5.0,"This is my go-to recipe. I&#39;ve been making it for years, and it&#39;s even my in-law family&#39;s favorite (and they are Sicilian Italian!). I usually do the beef/sausage combo, but I prefer just beef. I always try to use all fresh ingredients, including fresh mozzerella! Sometimes I will make it with just ricotta, but it&#39;s great both ways!"
5.0,This was absolutely delicious!  I added a touch of fine grated cheddar cheese with the mozzarella and used italian sausage.  Served this dish for Christmas as everyone was tired of ham and turkey.  My kids said this will be the new Christmas tradition at our house!!!
5.0,I made this for Christmas dinner &amp; got so many compliments!  The only change I made was I used 1 pound of Italian sausage &amp; 1/2 pound of ground beef.  So yummy!  The leftovers didn&#39;t last long!  You can&#39;t fail with this recipe.  I made it the day before &amp; let the flavors mingle overnight. Then baked it the next day.
5.0,"I really enjoyed this recipe. I felt that that the combination of ingrediants were great, however, I was not happy with the sauce itself. I felt it was a little overwhelming and I am interested in other people&#39;s comments and suggestions about the sauce. I just felt it was a little too thick and too overpowering."
5.0,Sooo yummy... The sausage made for a wonderful flavor and I love how the sauce is simmered for an hour to get it nice and thick.  A lot of lasagna turns out wet and runny.  This one is perfect!  Even my insanely picky husband liked it!
5.0,It is everything I want in a lasagna.  Everyone in my family loves it.
5.0,I have not made this recipe but it sounds like a great way to make the cottage cheese mix in the lasagna. 5 stars for creativity. I can not wait to make it for my family.
5.0,Great Lasagna!  I used home made noodles for this dish.  Super flavor and not difficult to prepare.  Will definitely have again.
5.0,Excellent recipe and easy to make. Shared it with 3 friends and they were amazed and said &#34;This is what I call a real lasagna recipe&#34;. Of course I will continue making it. Thumbs up!
5.0,Excellent!  I cut out the sausage and used all ground beef. This turned out perfect!
5.0,"The very best! I used 1 1/2 # ground beef and 1/2 # sausage. Also added 1/2 c water and used 1/2 t garlic powder instead of cloves (not a garlic fan).  No changes necessary...just my taste. My dinner guests agreed it&#39;s the best ever!!! Once cut, it stays in layers nicely, too."
5.0,"This was a great recipe!! It was easy to make and came out soooo good! Everyone loved it. Next time, I&#39;ll use hot sausage instead of sweet. The sauce was tasty and it was the perfect amount of ricotta. Definitely let the sauce cook for an hour or more; it makes a huge difference."
5.0,Awesome recipe.  It is the only one I use now.
5.0,Wow--delicious!  Made it for a party everyone loved it!
5.0,Yep - as good as everyone says.
5.0,"This is VERY good! The only tweak I made, was to add minced onions and a bay leaf to the meat sauce. Perfection!"
5.0,Everyone in my family loved this recipe!This is a keeper!
5.0,"I loved this recipe, I think it may be my &#34;go to&#34; lasagna recipe from now on. I used 1 pound of pork sausage, dried parsley, and only simmered the pasta sauce for 30 minutes. I recommend using a lasagna pan for this recipe, as the 9x13 is too small."
5.0,"I used all ground beef instead of part pork sausage...and we loved it.  Seems I&#39;ve been a short order cook around here with picky requests from kids, but my seven and four year old oohed and ahhed over something this amazing.  Made a batch for my in-laws who believed this was the best lasagna they&#39;ve tasted.  Completely worth the effort and extra time to put together.  Will be making this again soon.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe."
5.0,"My husband loved this recipe.  I have never used provolone in lasagna before.  It was great.  We have tried adding torn spinach as one of the layers, comes out great."
5.0,"This is my second rating of this recipe.  This time, I left out the sausage and only used hamburger meat.  I loved it this way and got many great comments too. I would have increased my star rating from 3 to 5 but website won&#39;t let me change my rating"
5.0,"The BEST lasagna I have ever had!  I did use italian sausage instead of plain, but that was the only change I made.  So good!"
5.0,"I add a few more seasonings, but this is excellent!"
5.0,"This recipe is by far the best lasagna I&#39;ve eatten, and I&#39;m not much of a lasagna person.  I made the recipe as-is the first time, and the second time, I tweaked it for a healthier version (no meat, so no simmering of the sauce ahead of time, reduced-fat ricotta cheese, reduced fat provolone, and a mix of 2% mozzarella and regular shredded mozzarella).  It still tasted fantastic!  Definitely making this again!"
5.0,Excellent!  I used itaillan sausage and 50/50 ratio of cottage &amp; ricotta.  Everybody Loves!
5.0,"Hello Lorri, thank you so much for such a wonderful, flavorful, and tasty lasagna. This is the best recipe. It&#39;s so good that I decided to make it for 150 people for my husbands  &#34;customer appreciation night&#34;. WOW, what was I thinking, Ha! The lasagna was a big hit but, I learned my lesson- if I don&#39;t have a double oven (which I don&#39;t) and have a couple of friends to help me I&#39;ll never attempt it again. I ended up making 8 pans, whew! But it was all good,  thanks again!"
5.0,This recipe is delicious! My whole family loved it!
5.0,Best lasagna recipe I have found.  I will definitely make this again.
5.0,"I have been making this recipe since it first came out in Taste of Home over a decade ago.  The only changes I&#39;ve made over the years is to use a mix of hot &amp; sweet Italian sausage, plus I add about 1/4 jar prepared sauce to thin sauce just a bit.  On occasion when I have extra fresh basil, I&#39;ll add with parsley to cheese/egg mixture.  I always receive rave compliments with this dish.  PS  I make a double batch and freeze one for the future.  No better recipe!!!"
5.0,My go to lasagna dish. So good. No one has disliked it. Had to use all beef for some who can not eat pork and added saute onions.
5.0,I have made this lasagna for years.  No other lasagna compares to this one.  I follow the recipe to the letter every time and it turns out perfectly every time.
5.0,I love this lasagna!!! Just LOVE it! So does everyone else in my family.
5.0,"Three people in my family found this recipe at around the same time.  The entire family agrees that this is the best lasagna recipe available. I don&#39;t know that it would be considered a traditional lasagna by Italian standards but we do not care it is our favorite. Easy to prepare and has the best of all lasagna recipes included in the ingredients! I tend to add my own touches to recipes as I make them, but not with this one;no &#34;improvements&#34; needed."
5.0,Awesome lasagna that makes even better leftovers!  Well worth the time &amp; effort!
5.0,I have been making this recipe since it was first published eleven years ago. People always enjoy it. Even my Italian mother-in-law likes it! Very easy recipe too. Highly recommend!
5.0,This was fun to make and delicious.
5.0,This has been my go to lasagna recipe since I discovered it in Taste of Home years ago. I also use the sauce recipe for pasta.
5.0,Just tried this the other night. Unbelievably good. Everyone loved it.
5.0,Made this for the family. Everyone raved about it. I followed the recipe exactly. Very good
5.0,"It requires a bit of work, but totally worth it!"
5.0,"This is my family&#39;s tradition now.  I make this every Christmas eve, and everybody enjoys it.  I do not think it is difficult to make or time consuming."
5.0,Everyone in my family loves this recipe; my mom even asked me for a copy because she likes it better than her&#39;s!
5.0,I had not made lasagna in a while and saw this recipe. I am so glad I did! It&#39;s easy and heartily delicious! I will definitely make this again.
5.0,Simply delicious! Everyone loved it!
5.0,We LOVED this recipe. It turned out beautiful. The only thing I did different was I didn&#39;t simmer the sauce for 60min instead I simmered it for 30min. Also during the browning process I only did it for 15min instead of 20. I&#39;m planning on making this for my parents this weekend. Thanks so much for the recipe.
5.0,"The prep time on this dish was a little more than I expected (I will admit that I didn&#39;t read the recipe closely at first), but the lasagna was worth the wait!  It&#39;s a mild flavored dish, sure not to offend anyone.  We enjoyed it, but I&#39;ll probably add spinach and mushrooms next time to add a little more interest.  All in all, it&#39;s definitely something I&#39;d serve to the in-laws.  :)"
5.0,"The meat sauce ended up very thick but still delicious! I left out the provolone and used dried parsley instead of fresh. Also, I used an aluminum lasagna pan so overflow wasn&#39;t a problem."
5.0,"This is my second rating of this recipe.  This time, I left out the sausage and only used hamburger meat.  I loved it this way and got many great comments too. I would have increased my star rating from 3 to 5 but website won&#39;t let me change my rating"
5.0,"Before trying this recipe, I have always made the same family recipe I had watched my parents make for years. I never have liked many other recipes....well, I saw how popular this recipe is here, so I tried it. AMAZINGLY GOOD!! I am afraid to tell my parents for fear of hurting their feelings! The only thing I did differently (because of lack of exact ingredients) was to substitute pizza sauce for the tomato sauce and replaced the italian seasoning with a mixture of basil and oregano. It was the best lasagna I have ever eaten. I will probably cut back on the sauce a bit next time. This lasagna is everything everyone says it is. Perfecto!"
5.0,Made this for my neighbors and they swore it was the best lasagna that they have ever had.
5.0,I have made this lasagne many times.It is wonderful but not everyone likes sausage.I replaced the sausage with ground pork and it was excellent.
5.0,We LOVE this lasagna.  We do all beef since we&#39;re not big sausage fans. It&#39;s so delicious and has ruined us to other lasagna&#39;s.
5.0,"Best lasagna I&#39;ve ever made.  My fiance always tells me all my other lasagna recipes have been bland, but he loved this one.  Gonna make it again this week!"
5.0,Deliciously cheesy.
5.0,Good like it is. I&#39;m leaving this one alone!
5.0,Absolutely wonderful!!
5.0,One word....  Delicious
5.0,The very best
5.0,I have made this several times and always get tons of compliments. Sauce is delicious.
5.0,SO DELICIOUS!!! No other lasagna even comes close to this one.
5.0,I have made this lasagna several  times and always get great reviews. I use venison meat instead of beef! Simply because it is what we have on hand.
5.0,I made this for my husband tonight.  He was speechless and let me say THAT doesn&#39;t happen very often.  Tasted great.  Will definitely  make again.  Will love the leftovers it gave us.
5.0,"This is an excellent recipe. This is also the first SUCCESSFUL lasagna recipe that I have made.  My guy absolutely LOVED it.  The only thing I did was double the sauce and the amount of mozarella.  There was plenty of sauce left over to make a small lasagna, or to use for spaghetti sauce."
5.0,GREAT LASAGNA!! One of the best..If not the best..
5.0,"Delicious! This recipe is great and easy. The only thing I had to change was the cooking time. Since I made it earlier in the day, it had been in the refrigerator so I took longer than the 50 minutes to cook. So just make sure you adjust your cooking time, if needed. But a really delicious recipe."
5.0,My boyfriend always orders lasagna from the Olive Garden.  This recipe was a big hit with him -- he thought it was better than the Olive Garden.  Very delicious!
5.0,This was the best Lasagna I have ever made.  It was wonderful.  I had family over for dinner and they loved it.
5.0,This is a fantastic lasagna. I used a foil pan so it wouldn&#39;t spill on the way to my in-laws. It did not dry out at all. I would make this again.
5.0,this is a family favorite! I don&#39;t like chunks of tomatoes so this is a winner! Sometimes I add pepperoni as well.
5.0,This was the lasagna recipe that I have been looking for!! Great flavor and cheesy!  This recipe is a winner (yes it is a blue ribbon contest winner!!) I use 1/2 hot Italian and 1/2 mild Italian sausage for the port sausage.  SO GOOD!
5.0,"The is the best lasagne recipe ever.  I had my Family over and wanted to try a new recipe that would feed a large group.  Lots of compliments and asking where I got the recipe.  Really easy but kind of long process to make. Followed the recipe exactly as written.  Will definately make this one again,soon."
5.0,i love lasagne!
5.0,"Love it, love it, and love it. I took this Lasagna to a pot luck and it was the hit of the night.  I didn&#39;t change a thing."
5.0,Best lasagna I have ever made.
5.0,I absolutely LOVE this recipe!!! It&#39;s soooo filling and delicious that it is also a hit when I make this for parties or dinner! Definitely worth the time to put this all together for my friends and family!
5.0,This was a HUGE hit.  This is the best lasagna recipe.
5.0,WOW! This will be my Lasagna recipe that I will always use! So GOOD!
5.0,"I tried this recipe yesterday for dinner. My husband and family said it was delicious maybe, the best lasagna he has eaten."
5.0,"Delicious.  I added chopped zucchini, green peppers and mushrooms to the sauce."
5.0,"It was amazing, my whole family loved it and my 4 yr old ask if we could have it every day!"
5.0,This was the first Lasagna recipe I&#39;ve ever made. I 2lbs of ground chuck instead of ground beef and pork sausage and it turned out great! Wonderful Recipe!
5.0,I&#39;ve made this many times.  It&#39;s fantastic.
5.0,I made this lasagna for a small family get-together.  It was really good but it is not a throw-together-at-the-last-minute recipe.  But I would definitely make it again!
5.0,Great recipe!!
5.0,"I  make this lasagna on special occasions two or three times a year and every time I make it, I get rave reviews.  It takes patience but it&#39;s well worth it.  Also, the recipe freezes well.  I put mine in an 11x17 pan because its too much for a 9x13."
5.0,"I made this recipe for a family get-together.  Everyone said it was fantastic, and I even got phone calls the next day about it.  I followed the recipe exactly, as I wanted to see what I&#39;d change.  Not a thing!  I&#39;ll never make another recipe after this.  It takes extra time, but it&#39;s well worth it."
5.0,This is the best lasagna recipe I have come across....I have modified it a bit when I make it.  I only use one can of tomato paste I feel that when you use two it has too much of a metallic taste (especially when eating leftovers) and it also makes the sauce too thick and reheated leftovers are too dry.  I also use slightly more tomato sauce and use two 15 oz cans of sauce.  I am not a huge sausage fan so I usually omit the sausage and just use the 1 lb of beef.
5.0,I have made this a number of times.  This is the best lasagna recipe I have come across so far.  I have been making this recipe for years.
5.0,The best home made lasagna ever!!
5.0,This recipe is a keeper! I was looking for some new ideas to enhance my usual way of making Lasagna. I really likes all the reviews of this recipe and I liked the ingredients. WOW! This is really good. I made the tomato sauce a day ahead of time and it tasted sooooo good ( I could hardly leave it alone!) Only changes I made were adding 2 extra garlic cloves and using Jenno&#39;s hot italian sausage in place of the sausage. This is now my new recipe.
5.0,I made it two times already and everyone loves it. This sat. i&#39;m making it again for a bridal shower i&#39;m hosting. Thank you
5.0,Very good. It will be the only lasagna I will ever make from now on.
5.0,"never made lasagna b4, this one reminded me of ones i grew up on! (I leave the sausage out, and use pre-made spaghetti sauce). Tastes amazing, everyone loves it! it&#39;s a crowd pleaser!!"
5.0,My entire family uses this recipe anytime that lasagna is craved! We all discovered this recipe several years ago and stopped looking for any other lasagna recipe. The only thing we look for now is to see which one of us is going to prepare the dish next. Love it!
5.0,This is the best lasagna recipe I have found. The meat sauce and cheeses compliment each other very well.
5.0,Amazingly good! My family prefers this recipe over my Italian-born mother-in-law&#39;s!
5.0,very tasty! not hard to make. I used the kind of noodles you dont need to boil before baking. good for one less step :)
5.0,This recipe really is as fabulous as everyone says! Wanted to make vegetarian lasagna for my neighbor so substituted the meat for boca crumbles and boca sausage crumbled. I love meat and I never would have known that it was vegetarian. The flavor and textures were amazing. Truly the perfect lasagna!
5.0,Awesome!
5.0,My absolute favorite! I usually make a double batch to freeze one pan for later!
5.0,MY FAMILY LOVED THIS RECIPE!
5.0,I have made this recipe for several holiday meals and also on Sunday meals.  I get many compliments and it is the best lasagna recipe I have ever made.  My husband always orders lasagna when we eat out and he said this recipe tops them all.
5.0,My friends and I agree that by far this is the best lasagna we have ever had.  I double the recipe and make them two at a time.  They freeze well uncooked.
5.0,This recipe is by far the best that I have ever used!  I don&#39;t think I will ever use another lasagna recipe again!
5.0,"Every time I have dinner guests, this is my go-to recipe.  If I have any left, it also freezes well for later.  I also make mine in a larger pan to avoid overflow in my oven."
5.0,This is the best lasagna recipe I have found. It&#39;s AMAZING!!
5.0,This is the best lasagna I have ever made.  I didn&#39;t have any pork sausage meat so I used ground pork.  This is the recipe I will always make.
5.0,This is the best lasagna recipe I have ever had.  I will not make anything else.  Make sure you put a piece of foil or a cookie sheet under the baking dish because this is filled to the brim and tends to overflow.
5.0,Excellent recipe!!! I added bacon bits and now it tastes like loaded baked potato in soup form!
5.0,"I added bacon bits, chili flakes and 2 tsp Franks hot sauce. Turned out delicious with so much flavour!I also mashed the caulflower before adding the cheese sauce. Definitely recommend this recipe! Yummmm"
5.0,"Don&#39;t let the name fool you, this is terrific!  Even though it is cauliflower instead of potato this soup is very tasty and easy to prepare.  I made it for Christmas dinner and was told by multiple guests that they loved it too."
5.0,"Simple &amp; excellent recipe! I see a lot of comments saying it was bland, I definitely disagree. I know it says hot pepper sauce optional, I would add it for sure. I used Frank’s Red Hot."
5.0,"This is one of those comforting, cozy kind of soups. My family and I were very sick with Covid a few months ago. I was staying with my 19 month old grandson because my daughter and her husband were in the hospital having my granddaughter and due to some complications on top of them also having Covid, I was with him for almost a week. Many people dropped off meals and groceries for us. I was so nauseated with the sickness and couldn’t eat much of anything. My son-in-law’s mom made this for me using almond milk and it very much hit the spot. It is literally all I could eat for days. I have made it exactly as written and it was delicious with both milks."
5.0,I’ve been making this soup for several years now. I have added a chopped onion and a whole rotisserie chicken cut into bite sized pieces. With the added ingredients I increase the water to at least 4 cups. I do like the idea of adding red pepper flakes for added flavor. My family loves this recipe.
5.0,This is a nice tasting cauliflower soup.  I really liked it and will make again.
5.0,"My granny god bless her use to serve this up to me decades ago and said its a poor man&#39;s soup.
I made it myself today and was surprised how it tasted exactly the same as my granny made. I also added whatever I had and put some sharp tasting parmesan cheese with the other shredded cheese I had and the taste was spectacular."
5.0,<p>Always looking for a healthy soup that will be suitable for my gluten-free friend and my diabetic friend. This was a winner. Easy to make (hardest part was breaking up the cauliflower) and delicious. </p>
5.0,"This is a keeper. I couldn’t decide whether to use vegetable vs chicken bouillon so did 1tsp of each. The tsp of hot sauce is NOT optional in my opinion, it’s a must. And no, it doesn’t make it spicy at all. I also added maybe an 1/8-1/4 tsp dry mustard (to give it that background kick like in beer cheese soup), 1/4 cup diced onion and 2 cloves crushed garlic into the veggies. I used sharp cheddar for the most flavor &amp; it came out perfect. Normally I’m always adding extra salt or bouillon to most soups but didn’t need to with this one. It was plenty thick without blending any of the veggies."
5.0,I made this for dinner tonight and it was excellen
5.0,This has been our favorite lasagna recipe for years!!!
5.0,"Dear Lorri,Thank you for this recipe.  I have made it every Christmas Eve for our family get-together ever since it was first published in Taste of Home magazine.  Everyone loves it.  And I love getting kudos for making it!Debbie B."
5.0,I made this for the second time yesterday for my boyfriend and his roommates. Everyone loved it! It is by far my favorite lasagna recipie.
5.0,"Love this recipe, it has become a constant go to and the family loves it!"
5.0,"I’m glad I read the review of course I used what everyone before me did I sautéed onion, garlic, Serrano pepper, carrots and cauliflower then I added the liquids. Tasted fantastic."
5.0,"Liz, I made it last night and used almond milk. My husband loved it."
5.0,This is absolutely my favorite.  Kids think it&#39;s bland but I love it!!  I did add the hot sauce and put more in than required.  So good.
5.0,"Everyone who has had this, enjoys it."
5.0,"I just made this soup and it is absolutely delicious.  Made one change, used vegetable broth instead of water to cook the vegetables.  It was so good I subscribed to the magazine."
5.0,I made this tonight! I also chopped up an onion with the other veggies.. it just feels wrong to cook without onions. I sautéed the veggies A little bit with olive oil and Epicure rosemary garlic seasoning.  Then added in chicken broth instead of the water.  To finish I added in some buffalo hot sauce.... so good! I will be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe.
5.0,"I really liked this recipe and so did most of my family.  I did make a few minor changes however.  First, I sauteed onion in olive oil, added the shredded carrot and cauliflower florets and sauteed for a few minutes with the onion.  Then I added chicken stock instead of water.  After I added the cheese sauce to the cauliflower, I used my immersion blender to make a more creamy thick soup.  I have bookmarked this soup and will definitely make it again."
5.0,Absolutely delicious!
5.0,Very tasty.  Sautéed veggies in EVOO and added onion and garlic. Added a little paprika and dry mustard.  Pressure cooked everything non dairy for 5 minutes and a 10 min natural release. Made the roux according to directions and folded it in.  Total hit. Next time I think I may add a splash of white wine or sherry and a potato.
5.0,"I made this recipe exactly as recipe said.  I tasted it and it was really really good.  I husband wanted cauliflower soup and this was the best.  Don&#39;t leave out the celery because that really adds a lot of flavor.  I am on a kick of using almond milk because it&#39;s healthier than cream or half and half and it can stay in my fridge for 2 months whereas milk products need to be used.  The almond milk tastes no different.    The only thing I noticed was that it made so little soup.  So my review already said the recipe as stated is very good....BUT I added 2 potatoes, cooked, drained and mashed with a little butter and added to the soup with 2 cups of water and 1 T. soup base and 1 more cup of cheese.......When I go to the work of making a soup, I want more than just a couple meals for the 2 of us."
5.0,I make this soup every winter. It is one of my husband &amp; mine favorite. I try to use also low fat cheddar or sharp cheese to cut more fat. I also use sodium reduce better than bouillon. If I have broccoli leftover from a prior dinner or have fresh will add it too.
5.0,"Make this 4-5 times a year.  I do add chopped onion.  1/4 cup of chopped celery?  What do I do with the rest of the celery stalk.  lol  I think adding one celery stalk to the soup will be just fine, maybe even more."
5.0,"Hubby pronounced this, &#34;Very Good&#34; even though he is not a soup lover.  I did add a chopped onion and because the head of cauliflower was quite large, I added some extra celery and 1 extra carrot.  I used skim milk and added Bergeron Cheese instead of cheddar. because that&#39;s what was in the &#39;fridge.  This one goes into my &#34;Good enough to serve to Company&#34; recipe file."
5.0,I made this over the weekend because it was chilly out and really wanted a nice soup.  Made as stated in the recipe but I think next time I will add some sautéed  onions to it.  I did use my potato masher to break up the cauliflower into smaller pieces.  Will definitely make again.
5.0,This is the best soup!  Took to work and everyone wanted the recipe!
5.0,"Made this tonight for the first time.  My husband and I loved it, and my 7 and 4 year old too! I did add 1/4 cup diced onion as others suggested. I would imagine you could use this same base for broccoli or potato soup too."
5.0,Made it today room-mates raved - have to try it again w/onions. Love your recipes
5.0,"I made this today - having my daughter &amp; grands over for lunch. It&#39;s SO tasty! I did add sautéed onions &amp; garlic &amp; 1/2 of a hot pepper from the garden and then thinly sliced crimini mushrooms. I&#39;ll come back after lunch with a family update! OH, and this was my very first time making a rue and it was successful!! YAY!"
5.0,"added garlic, serrano pepper, broccoli and an extra cup of cheese. also find that cooking the veggies 12-15 makes them too mushy. cut the time in half.   I have made this a dozen times at least and just keep tweaking to my tastes. of course everyone is different but it’s a quick and inexpensive recipe so you can really just keep experimenting! thank you for the recipe!"
5.0,Easy recipe made a great hearty flavorful soup! I will definitely make again!
5.0,This was such an easy recipe and simply delicious!  I adjusted all measurements by half and it was just right for serving 2 of us. I also used vegetable broth instead of water. Will be using this recipe again and again!
5.0,Whole family enjoyed this soup!
5.0,"This is one of my family&#39;s favorite meals- especially my husband&#39;s! It has replaced the traditional chili recipe in our house, and everyone I&#39;ve made it for has loved it."

5.0,"Delicious! Lots of flavor. Very quick and easy. I boiled the chicken in broth with the garlic and onion, shredded it then added it back in with the rest of the ingredients. Mashed some of the beans. Also added some cream cheese, a handful of jack cheese and thickened it with some corn starch. "

5.0,"This was a really great recipe.  I was short one can of green chilies and think it would have helped to have both of them.  Also, I didn&#39;t have whipping cream and substituted a small can of evaporated milk which work fine.  I also used the low sodium chicken broth because the sodium count is pretty high on this.  All in all a keeper."

5.0,"Wonderful, creamy, great tasting soup.  I used cooked chicken because I like my chicken extra well done, also used minced garlic instead of powder.  My family loved it, and I will double the recipe the next time. Thank you for sharing!"
5.0,I love this recipe
5.0,"Good taste, nice and easy to follow instruction even for non chefs"
5.0,They make the soup about once a month. It’s my Favorite soup.
5.0,"Such an easy recipe and very healthy. I added garlic and onions, used 2 1/2 C  chicken broth instead of water, and excluded the chicken/vegetable bouillon."
5.0,This soup is so good!  I did use an emulsion blender to make chunks smaller. My husband loved it!
5.0,"This is a really good &#34;base&#34; recipe - good as is, but you can customize to come up with something that is perfect for your taste.  I threw in a handful of smoked salmon just before serving and also ran half of it through the blender just to thicken a bit more - salmon really kicked it up a notch.  I always follow a recipe the first time and go from there."
5.0,Made it and he lovedit.This is a very good soup.
5.0,9/14/2020...I&#39;m just reading the email for this recipe. Sounds great but can someone please tell about the cheese? Mentioned in the instructions but not ingredients. Thanks!
5.0,It was very good only thing is  it got real thick what did i do wrong
5.0,"My husband, who doesn&#39;t like cauliflower, loved this recipe.  It is delicious!"
5.0,"This is so good! It is always requested in our house. The only changes--  I use broth instead of water, add 1/4 cup chopped onion to the carrot mixture, and cayenne instead of hot sauce. Yum!"
5.0,"I use broth instead of water and double recioe so I can freeze for later, so good!"
5.0,Absolutely deeeelicious!  And super easy!
5.0,"Susan, Don&#39;t add the 3/4 tsp. of salt and use low-sodium chicken broth. If you are used to no salt, this shouldn&#39;t be a problem for you. Sometimes lemon or a splash of vinegar will help.  Use sharp cheddar instead of mild cheese for a bit more tang."
5.0,"Mom and kid approved!  Recipe was so easy and ingredients won&#39;t break the bank.  The only tweeks I made were to omit the hot sauce and add 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes.  At the end I used an immersion blender to make it more soup-y.  Daughter told me I should make it every night!  And at only 159 calories per serving, this recipe is a winner!"
5.0,I love this soup but how are you getting 2 quarts out of 4 1/2 cups of liquid?
5.0,"This is such a great recipe! 1. Because it&#39;s mostly ingredients I keep in-stock, 2. It&#39;s easy, 3. It&#39;s delicious! This one is worth saving and sharing."
5.0,I love this recipe! I just tweak it a little bit by adding some chopped onion and some fresh minced garlic!! Thanks Taste of Home!!
5.0,This is now one of my favorite soups.  I always add a small can of green chilies in place of the hot sauce.
5.0,Our favorite soup!
5.0,"This turned out very good, I have made it twice. I did use broth instead of bullion. Very easy to make."
5.0,Best cauliflower soup ever! I’m going to add shrimp the next time!
5.0,This has been a family favourite for many years. So quick and easy to make!
5.0,Great recipe quick to make and delicious
5.0,"This soup was delicious and so quick and easy to make!! I didn&#39;t have any soup stock on hand so I just used water and added a bunch of extra seasonings (poultry seasoning, garlic, cayenne, paprika, etc. right at the beginning) it worked out really well and my whole family was happy with it!"
5.0,Made this soup and ate almost all of it myself because it taste fantastic.
5.0,I made this exactly as written (except I subbed herb
5.0,Yummy and a success with the family... used 1% milk and added some lentils to thicken.  Increased pepper as had no  chilli oil .  added crushed coriander seeds cos I like them.  Left out flour and would leave out butter next time .  Gave each bowl a tiny bit of vintage cheddar so reduced fat.  Used vegetarian oxo. (used this recipe to use up left over cooked cauliflower from Sunday lunch) Really  Lovely will make again x
5.0,Great recipe - easy and quick and result is homely and delicious
5.0,"The easy recipe combined satisfying vegetable flavors in a light cheesy base. I measured my ingredients using 5 3/4 cups cauliflower (including some sliced stem pieces), 3/4 cup carrot, 1/2 cup celery (1 stalk), and 2 chicken cubes. Watch the cooking time for veggies to avoid mushy texture. I cooked mine 10-minutes and thought cauliflower was a bit too soft. Have cheese sauce ingredients measured and ready once the pot of vegges are truned on, this goes together quickly. I l enjoyed this soup because the recipe only used one cup of cheese, the calories were lower, and it avoided a thick, glue-like soup. Serves 4 as a main dish; they will want more!"
5.0,Absolutely delicious and so easy to make. This is a home run!!!
5.0,"Loved this soup! I roasted the cauliflower in olive oil with a shallot and a sweet green pepper for about 15 minute. Also used a very small amount of slab bacon sauteed with the cut up stems and leaves of the cauliflower. After roasting, I put the veggies in the pot with the broth"
5.0,"Made it as stated, it was amazing ! My husband said please make that again!"
5.0,"Wow, this soup was wonderful! So easy to put together and good flavour.  The only things I did differently were to put a ¼ tsp of crushed red pepper flakes in, instead of the hot sauce  and I chopped the vegetables fine with my hand blender after they were cooked and then added the milk mixture. This recipe went into my “keep” file!"
5.0,"I make this all the time.  It is delicious!  You can substitute/add broccoli, Brussel sprouts, asparagus, cabbage.  I always add a bit of finely minced red bell pepper with the veggies and I brown garlic and onions with the butter/oil.   It takes it to another level.  I also fry bacon or add chunks of ham to the soup.  SO GOOD!"
5.0,I made this and it’s a hit.  Add a loaf of semolina bread and it’s an awesome meal!!
5.0,We had a snowstorm in Michigan today.  This comfort food really hit the spot and has great flavor.  My husband and son didn&#39;t know they were eating cauliflower!  I will definitely be making this again. Thank you.
5.0,I want this soup everyday!
5.0,Great soup. I did exactly as the recipe stated. It was delicious. The next time I make it i will add some chopped roasted green chilies in it.  Ima green chilei nut
5.0,"YumO! I added 1/3 cup frozen corn, 4.5 oz copped green chillies and 8oz chopped cherrywood ham. Very versatile recipe!"
5.0,"I have made this recipe twice.  My broth was not thin at all.  I took a couple of couple of cups and pureed , then made sure the roux was thick when I added it to the broth.  My soup is really, really creamy, and I followed the recipe exactly--the first time.  The second batch I added a can of chopped green chilies, just because I like them.  Oh, and I didn&#39;t add the carrots, because I don&#39;t like carrots.  This recipe is one I will fix frequently.  I even tricked my husband into thinking it was baked potato soup.  He loved it!"
5.0,"So delicious on a winter day.  I added broccoli and corn.  Thank you, Debbie, for sharing this recipe."
5.0,"Relatively easy to make and very good.  It&#39;s not a heavy, cream soup.  Flavor gets better a day or two after it&#39;s made."
5.0,"This is delicious soup.  My husband n I prefer cauliflower over broccoli.  I tweeked the rue slightly based on other comments of the soup being watery, n it turned out perfect.  Next time I make it my husband wants bacon added."
5.0,"OMG! Just made this soup for the first time tonight and it is delicious!! Super easy and fast too and given low fat milk, a little butter and cheese, pretty healthy. This will be a new staple!!"
5.0,I added more celery and cheese. Also added onions. Coarsely mashed.   Excellent.
5.0,Love this soup.  I just added a bit of shredded onion and coarsely mashed the cauliflower.  Thank you.
5.0,Outstanding... a new family favorite. I did several things differently... by accident. I added 2 Tablespoons of chicken seasoning (Better than Bullion) instead of 2 teaspoons. Knowing that would be salty I didn&#39;t add any extra salt. I added 4 Tablespoons butter and flour... instead of 3. And still only used the 2 cups of mile. Added a bit extra cheese and cooked it for about 10 minutes. LOVED it. Not bland at all...
5.0,Loved this soup. Easy to make.  Will keep as a favorite soup recipe
5.0,"Wonderful, creamy, great tasting soup.  I used cooked chicken because I like my chicken extra well done, also used minced garlic instead of powder.  My family loved it, and I will double the recipe the next time. Thank you for sharing!"
5.0,Yummy yummy! I have adapted to making it in the slow cooker; I also add a few dashed of chili seasoning when cooking the chix and onion in the skillet before adding to the crock pot.

5.0,Great soup very easy made a couple changes for personal preference. Used coconut milk  and skipped the cheese. Used half veggie broth plus the bullion. It was fabulous
5.0,"I make this often,  I sometimes  use broccoli,  it&#39;s yummy too."
5.0,"Omg...  I made this, I did add mushrooms instead of carrots. And i did add smoked paprika but amazing.  I&#39;m a vegetarian so this was perfect. I used vegetable broth not water also.  I am in love with this and will pass it along. Yummy!"

5.0,Very quick and simple to make.  Delicious!
5.0,"I made this and really enjoyed it. I had to sub out a few things though. If you are unlucky like me and did not have any type of broth on hand, you can use a couple cups of water with a couple tbsp of melted butter added to mimic the fats in broth. Then, i added a few seasonings to the mixture to taste : cardamom, turmeric, nutmeg, white pepper and a dash of salt. I also begun with some chopped onion and 2 cloves of garlic (just preference) . I also did not have carrots, but used frozen butternut squash in its place. Next time if i have more time, I will roast my vegetables."
5.0,I stumbled upon this recipe and made it because I needed to cook a cauliflower.  This soup is absolutely Delicious!!!!!! So easy to make and all of the ingredients are staples in my pantry. I will be making this again and again!!!

5.0,"I changed it up a little. Added a jalapeno, substituted a half teaspoon xanthium gum for the flour and unflavored almond milk for the milk.   Sooo good."
5.0,This was wonderful and easy to make.  I added an onion and used sharp cheddar.  Will make a little thicker next time as well.
5.0,Excellent and easy to make.
5.0,So easy to make and everyone loved it!
5.0,"I&#39;m giving this 5-stars for taste! In my own recipe book, it&#39;s a 4-star recipe because I reserve 5 stars for recipes that I would serve to company and it&#39;s not quite fancy enough for that. But when it&#39;s a cold and rainy night, and you&#39;re home alone with your husband staying in, and you have a loaf of french bread that needs to be eaten, this is the perfect meal. I just used a spicy salt and pepper blend instead of hot sauce. We loved it."
5.0,"Very good soup.  Takes longer than 30 minutes - unless you already have the vegetables prepared.  I used one 14 oz. can of reduced-sodium chicken broth vs. bouillon and ended up including 1 3/4 cups water with the broth (with only the broth plus 3/4 cup water, there wasn&#39;t enough liquid for the vegetables to cook in). I added 1 tsp. dried parsley, 1/4 tsp. onion powder and 1/8 tsp. garlic powder, but did not include the hot sauce.  The head of cauliflower was about 1 1/2 lb. and about 6 cups of florets. The finished soup was just a little over 8 cups.  Served with corn muffins, yummy!"
5.0,Subbed chicken broth for bullion because that&#39;s all I had on hand.  Soup was delicious - even my very picky 5 year old ate it!
5.0,"I love cauliflower soup and this will definitely be in my rotation. The second time I made it the only cheese I had on hand was a decent pepper jack so that&#39;s what I used, and it was even better!"
5.0,My family loves cauliflower and this soup is a real treat on cold winter days.  They can&#39;t seem to get enough of it.
5.0,Everyone loved this soup!
5.0,"This cauliflower soup is easy to make. It is delicious, light, filling, and for this family, a &#34;keeper&#34; recipe."
5.0,"Fabulous Soup, so easy to make, I substituted the chicken bouillon cube for a 32 oz carton of  Vegetable Broth. Perfect choice. I also cut up more carrots and celery as we love veggies. This is the third time making this soup and it is a keeper. Very tasty."
5.0,"Delicious Soup!  I made it just as the recipe instructs.  I had no hot sauce, I did have some Pepper jack cheese , so I added two slices of it.  I like the fact that this soup is good for me, tasty and not high in calories."
5.0,Very easy recipe and quite delicious! I did dice 1/2 of a small onion and omitted the cheese and the soup was still delicious. Thank you.
5.0,"I made this soup per the recipe and did add some minced garlic and half an onion, next time I would add two more carrots. The soup is great it is a keeper."
5.0,"Really tasty! Used celery salt instead of fresh celery (reduced reg salt some to accommodate). Added some  onion powder, garlic powder, and 4 oz Velveeta."
5.0,"I first made this a week ago without bouillon, which I didn&#39;t have.  I chose this recipe after reading several others because of the nutritional values.  Then I read a review about substituting  chicken broth for the bouillon and water.  I have type 2 diabetes sooo...low sodium chicken broth, low fat cheddar and milk,  and it&#39;s a solid 5 star from ingredients that are usually in my kitchen.  Thanks for posting, Debbie!Added after trying this a few times:  Great base with almost endless  possibilities!  I&#39;ve also done this as potato soup and chicken soup and still experimenting."
5.0,Without a doubt one of the best soups I&#39;ve made! I followed the directions and added a little extra cheese. Came out very good and didn&#39;t last long either!
5.0,"My Favorite soup. I exchange chicken broth for water, add an onion and an extra cup of cheese to give a little more pizazz that my family loves."
5.0,"This was excellent I used broccoli instead of cauliflower and used evaporated milk added onion, parsley and basil,  I did mash the broccoli so it wasn&#39;t big chunks, not mashing it to bits but just to break up some. Will be making this again wonderful.  For those that said it was too thin I didn&#39;t think so at all"
5.0,"Just made this soup for dinner &amp; absolutely loved it. Forgot to pick up some shredded cheddar cheese, so used velveeta &amp; it was delicious. Will be making it again...soon!"
5.0,Just made this with pepper jack cheese and it was awesome.  Will be making this again.
5.0,I made this soup and thought it was delicious! Added broccoli for a bit more color. Will save this recipe to enjoy again!
5.0,I made this and it is delicious. I didn&#39;t have cheddar but I had marble which is close enough. I also added onion to celery and carrots while cooking. Will make this recipe again.
5.0,Made this soup and it is delicious.
5.0,"LOVED IT!   I don&#39;t normally like cheese in my soup, but the cheese compliments this soup perfectly, and I loved the addition of the celery.  I added two small onions.  Next time I will saute the vegetables in the butter first, then make the roux.  I used 4 T butter and flour and only 2 cups bouillon (low-sodium)."
5.0,"Loved this soup. I am not a soup lover, but on a hunch tried this recipe and discovered a new fav.  Simple to make and very tasty and filling. Simply delicious."
5.0,Amazing soup! All 4 kids loved it also. Followed recipe exact. Used sharp cheese and thickened it a little at the end! Will make again!
5.0,This is a great recipe for chili cookoffs or dinners... it&#39;s a perfect substitute for those who can&#39;t eat the acidic &#34;red chili&#34;.
5.0,<p>A favorite of my hubby. He loves the flavor of this one and so do I!</p>
5.0,"I loved this chili.  I made the recipe exactly as written except that I did not have quite enough sour cream; so I ended up using 3/4 c. sour cream and 3/4 c. whipping cream.  I definitely didn&#39;t need the extra fat, but it was excellent."

5.0,"Amazingly good.  Going to test it out with lowfat sour cream next time.  I couldn&#39;t find chopped chillies, so I used salsa verde instead.  Really really good, I might replace my old red chili recipe with this!"

5.0,"I have made this recipe for 3 different chili cookoffs... and have won first every time! Also, it&#39;s a great alternative to chili dinners for those who can not have regular tomato-based chili. I&#39;ve served this to over 100 people, and I&#39;m yet to find someone who did not love it."

5.0,"OMGosh!!!  Just made this recipe for the first time and it is to die for!  I did as some other reviewers stated by adding in some onion, garlic, and red pepper.  I didn&#39;t have any celery, so instead, used some dry celery flakes.  I subbed 2 cups of Almond milk for the 2% (for those of us who are lactose intolerant) and added in some hot pepper flakes.  This is a keeper for sure and will be trying it with broccoli next time.  I think some bacon bits would be good in it as well.  Thanks for a WONDERFUL recipe!!!"
5.0,Outstanding!!! Look no further... this is the only cauliflower soup recipe you will ever need.
5.0,"Quick an easy.  Omitted chile peppers(dont like the hot/heat it would bring) ,left out the celery. Used half an half mixed w/half cup water instead of whole milk.  Used  Monterey  cheese instead of cheddar. Creamy an yummy! ! Not a drop left after serving!"
5.0,Quick easy and good
5.0,Very good basic recipe! I added some broccoli and a handful of green peas for color. Add or subtract -  it&#39;s all good.
5.0,"this soup is excellent! I did however , use no-sodium chicken bouillon , since we are watching sodium intake.  It was great! Next time, I may use broccoli ."
5.0,"Since there are only 2 of us, I made a 1/2 batch - using about 3.5 cups of cauliflower. It made about 3 large dinner size bowls of soup. Excellent! My husband really liked it. Instead of hot sauce, I sprinkled on a Turmeric spice mixture. Yum, just the right amount of spice!"
5.0,"Easy recipe, with most ingredients already in the kitchen. Very good. Kids loved it, my toddler included! Suggest pairing it with salad and home made bread sticks for a meal OR a sandwich! Yum! Also, one more suggestion.... the recipe says to put it in a bowl, but I&#39;d put it in a pan and bring it to a boil ;)"
5.0,"Excellent soup, I highly recommend trying it."
5.0,Very skeptical of veggie soups but WOW! Very delicious and full of flavor. I just diced the carrots and added a 1/4 cup diced onions too. Will be making again!!
5.0,Really good
5.0,This soup was amazing!  I did use low sodium chicken broth in place of the water and bullion.  This was so good served w/ some great sea salt and garlic pita crackers!
5.0,My Nephew thought he did not like Cauliflower....And then he had this soup. Its a winner in his book.
5.0,This soup was awesome!!!  I left out the celery (had none in the house) and added chicken to get more protein.  Very easy and quick for lunch also.  This will be made again.  :)
5.0,"I tried this recipe tonight and it is delicious!  I didn&#39;t have celery, didn&#39;t use the hot pepper sauce, but added some cayenne pepper because I like that better, and used 4 cheese Mexican style cheese because that&#39;s what I had on hand.  I used canned carrots (collective gasp)This will definitely be making repeat appearances in my house.  My nephew even commented on how good it was.  Thanks for sharing this one."
5.0,This is a great soup. A family favorite
5.0,I am a huge soup lover and this was really tasty!! I didn&#39;t use celery or hot pepper sauce but I added in garlic powder and chopped onions. Definitely will be making this again!
5.0,Fantastic soup - didn&#39;t use hot pepper but did add minced garlic and onion.  Instead of bouillon cube just added chicken broth.  Will definitely make again and again.
5.0,"Delicious soup!  I added 1 medium onion diced.  I also saut?ed the onion, celery, carrots and cauliflower in 1 Tbsp butter for a few minutes before adding water and bouillon."
5.0,I made this soup last week for the first time because I had leftover cauliflower that I needed to use up. It was so quick &amp; easy to make so I wasn&#39;t expecting the taste to be so great. It was really good though. This will now be my go-to Cauliflower Soup.
5.0,This was probably the best soup that I&#39;ve ever made.  I followed the recipe and added  the hot sauce.  I used an emulsion blender on the cooked vegetables before adding the cheese sauce.  I also added a few croutons and fresh cracked pepper to each bowl......absolutely delicious.
5.0,"this is likely one of the easiest, tastiest soup...definitely on my to make list again.  I was surprised that it tasted as good as it did at first taste and didn&#39;t need to sit to gel the flavours."
5.0,Loved this so did my family. I didn&#39;t have any carrots so I grated parsnips. Also I added fresh grated and chopped ginger.
5.0,This will be my staple.  Absolutely delicious.  I live cauliflower soup.  This is my favorite.
5.0,"I won second place in a Chili Cook-off with this recipe.  I was told by one of the judges it should have been first place, in her opinion, but it was not traditional enough!  Still, I am asked for the recipe and to make it on occasions."

5.0,I made this chili for a church function and had rave reviews.  If you don&#39;t like a ton of spice the green chilis are enough.  I have 4 little kids and they loved it but I left out the cayenne pepper.

5.0,This was WONDERFUL!  My husband and I loved it so much we&#39;ve decided to make it for the family for the holiday.  My husband also thinks I should enter this in the chili cookoff at our campground becuase he thinks it would win (he was a judge last year and said this was better than any chili he tasted).

5.0,"We loved this.  I made a few modifications and it still turned out great.  I used boneless chicken thighs, I added 1 can kernal corn, 1 additional 10 oz can of broth, and chopped bell peppers with the onion.  I also used light sour cream and 1/2 -1/2 since I didn&#39;t not have the heavy cream, and it was just great."

5.0,EX!!!!!..U can also  add Broccoli part way thru cooking...
5.0,"I made this soup yesterday and it is wonderful.  I had my daughter and her family try it as well.  Everyone loved it.  I didn&#39;t have any bouillon cubes so I used equal amount of vegetable broth and no water.  I also took someone&#39;s advice and pureed just a little of the cauliflower mixture to thicken the soup.  This is a well-balanced, tasty soup.  Thanks for the great recipe."
5.0,I made a half batch of this last night and it was great!  I love a quick recipe that is still from-scratch!
5.0,I made this and it was amazing I added alittle left over chicken I did double batch glad I did. YUM!
5.0,Delicious!  Added some onion and garlic powder (because I really like onion and garlic).  Would have been great without.
5.0,Excellent soup My family loves it also......my sister tried it and also loves it and now makes it for her family too.Thanks Taste Of Home
5.0,Loved the taste. Leftovers went into freezer. I&#39;m anxious to thaw and try again.
5.0,"Delicious, easy, and very filling!"
5.0,"Loved it - quick, easy to make on a hectic holiday night! My husband, who is not a fan of cauliflower, even had seconds!  Made it per recipe - no substitutions.  Did not have hot sauce on hand, but will try splash in it next time!  May try it with some smoked sausage next time, too, for a heartier meal."
5.0,I highly recommend making this soup. I added minced garlic to it.
5.0,Hubby and I love this soup.  Next time we will add cooked bacon to it to give it also a meaty flavor.  And my hubby generally does not like soup!
5.0,"Awesome soup...I added about half a bag of baby carrots, a jalapeno pepper, one sweet bell pepper, one onion, 3 stalks of celery, one carton of turkey broth, 5 cups of water, garlic clove, salt &amp; pepper. Cooked until tender, ran veggies thru Vitamix and with the broth mixture I added 3T. of flour and 2cups milk to make my rue. Added the 1 cup of cheddar cheese, stirred and added my pureed veggies. WOW Oh WOW...this soup rocks. Very filling and healthy. According to my calorie count, each cup is about 55 calories...Eat More Soup....  :-)"
5.0,"It was very easy to make and tasted great.  I will make it again, soon.  I also made it substituting broccoli."
5.0,"Fantastic Soup!  I left my cauliflower in big chunks when it was simmering.  Then once it was soft, before I added the b?chamel sauce, I gently used a potato masher.  This ensured all the cauliflower chunks were in bite size pieces."
5.0,Working man husband is diabetic-- hard to fill up on a low carb diet- -but  add in 1 or 2 lbs of  browned pork sausage to this marvelous soup recipe and he&#39;s in heaven!
5.0,Delicious and so easy to make!
5.0,So simple and soooo good!!
5.0,Good!!
5.0,Very good. I would like it a little thicker so I may mash the cauliflower some next time.
5.0,Love it so rich and tasty and only 159 calories for 1 cup serving
5.0,Fantastic. I didn&#39;t shred my carrots and I added a few extra. I got rave reviews at home.
5.0,"This is wonderful!!! I did think it needed a little more flavor (I didn&#39;t add the pepper sauce), so I used 4 chicken bouillon cubes in the water. Perfect!!! I have made this twice, once with cauliflower and once with broccoli, and will make it again and again!!!"
5.0,I made this for a Christmas Eve family dinner.  It was a huge hit.
5.0,"I love it ,will try it again thanks for the awesome recipy"
5.0,"Making this again, tonight. I have a head of fresh cauliflower ready and waiting, and a few carrots. I swap the celery for a white onion, add a bit of cream to the milk, and hit it with the immersion blender a few times to make it almost-smooth... Add a grilled cheese sandwich and a little salad and I am one happy, happy girl."
5.0,"This was absolutely delicious. The only changes I made were to use 1% milk because that&#39;s all I had in the house, and to add a little chopped ham we had leftover from Christmas. Thick, creamy and SO quick, the whole thing took 30 minutes from prep to bowl. This is a keeper."
5.0,"Very, very good! I added chopped onions. Next time I will make a little thicker, will add more flour. Flavor is awesome!"
5.0,"This soup is excellent!  Everyone loved it, I also added some chopped onion because I had some handy from making another soup"
5.0,Fantastic recipe! My family loved it.
5.0,Amazing! Perfect comfort food and finally a soup without onion and garlic! (I am currently 6 months pregnant and have had an aversion to onions and garlic my entire pregnancy-trying to find canned soup or a homemade soup recipe without these ingredients is like searching for the Holy Grail.) I made a couple of modifications-I used my immersion blender to puree some of the soup to make it thicker and add a silkier texture. I also used crushed red pepper flakes to add some spice because franks hot sauce contains garlic powder. :)
5.0,"I don&#39;t normally post reviews, but WOW!  I did take what I thought was the best advice from the other reviewers, but must give 5 stars for the original recipe for getting me started.  I doubled the carrots and celery, and used 3 cups of low sodium chicken broth.  I also gave the cauliflower mixture a few shots with the immersion blender.  After doing so, I added about 8 oz. of chopped cooked ham.  I used red pepper flakes instead of hot sauce.  I also cut down on the salt -- probably a bit less than 1/2 tsp.  The final result was incredible.  Kudos to the OP!"
5.0,"Absolutely wonderful and healthy. I used my &#34;basket&#34; from Co-op we picked up yesterday. I changed by using 3 X more celery and carrots, and half low salt chicken stock I had on  hand.  To thicken, I used King Arthur Instant Clear Jel rather than flour and dropped the butter in pot. The pepper flakes enhanced the flavors.Thank you Debbie"
5.0,During yesterday&#39;s snowstorm I made this rich and creamy soup. I use milk and had to use a little extra as the soup was too thick. I also pureed the vegetables before adding the milk and cheese mixture. Serve with salad and fresh bread. My husband lived it. Good thing I doubled the recipe!
5.0,I just made this soup and just like Moxier I tripled the celery and carrots and added 1/2 onion and some button mushrooms... it turned out awesome...its a great rue and soup starter for all cheesy milky soups... good recipe!
5.0,"Very flavorful. I doubled the celery, used low sodium chicken base, added extra 1/2 cup water and omitted salt.  I&#39;ve never had cauliflower soup, but this will go in my collection of soup favorites."
5.0,"Fabulous recipe! Great use of cauliflower, tasty and hearty soup. I used a little less butter, more cauliflower and carrots than called for. I also used a can of condensed milk instead of fresh  and hit it with the immersion blender. I will definitely make again!"
5.0,So good. Rich and flavorful. Easy to make.
5.0,This is very simple and tasty. You wouldn&#39;t know it&#39;s a healthy soup by the indulgent taste. I made it with milk and it&#39;s still delicious.
5.0,"This was excellent. I thought it would be bland but it was full of flavor and my guest raved about it. I used frozen cauliflower, almond oil and basil olive oil because that is all I had on hand. I pureed the vegetables and served it as an entree. There was enough for four people, not eight but we were all satisfied. Everyone asked for the recipe."
5.0,"Made the original recipe except swapped 1/8 tsp hot pepper flakes for sauce.  Not sure how the soup got rated at 8 - 1 cup servings when there&#39;s only 4 1/2 cups liquid in the recipe ...  Irregardless, the soup was delicious and it&#39;s on my &#34;keeper&#34; list."
5.0,Delicious!  I prefer to use 2C chicken stock with half a cup of water to eliminate the MSG from the bouillon.
5.0,"The BEST soup I&#39;ve ever made!  It thicken up after it set awhile, so next time I&#39;ll add more milk or water.  I added 2 cloves of garlic, chopped, and 1/2 tsp Tumeric (which I put in everything since it&#39;s so good for you) and chopped up 1/2 Red Pepper to add a little color.  I LOVE THIS SOUP!"
5.0,This was a really good soup. Its hard not to double the recipe. I omitted the red pepper sauce.
5.0,OMG!! What a delicious soup!  Only made 2 adjustments.  Used sodium-free chicken stock instead of water and bouillon.  Also used a combo of american &amp; asiago cheese a little more than a cup. Next time gonna use broccoli.
5.0,THANK YOU I am a newly diagnosed diabetic Finally I found something I like with low carbs. I made it with almond milk b/c my doctor wants me to switch from &#34;real milk&#34; to this stuff and it was still really good. I am actually eating it right now for breakfast!
5.0,"Wonderful recipe. So delicious.  I added garlic, onion and brussel sprouts to add some green to the soup. Next time I will also add chicken. This was an easy recipe and perfect for Fal season."
5.0,Wonderful recipe. I like a chunkier soup so I doubled the veggies and steamed instead of boiled them and then added them when I combined the cheese sauce to the water.   I also blended about 1/2 a head of cauliflower to make a creamier base. Had it with a side of soft boiled eggs for some protein and it was a wonderful dinner.
5.0,"Excellent! I knew with so many good reviews it had to be good &amp; wow! Made as written without ingredient changes, but pur?ed about 1-1/2 cups mixture &amp; mixed back in to add texture as another reviewer noted. Will definitely make again! Easy &amp; wonderful!"
5.0,Awesome!  I used Velveeta cheese cause that&#39;s what I had.  Hubby advised Make it again.  Enough for 2 &amp; enough left to reheat again.   Can increase carrot or celery but use extra bouillon &amp; water if you do.
5.0,"I have made this at least once a week for the last month. I will tell you how I changed it just a bit and it is AMAZING!!!! I always use low sodium chicken broth. I add some broccoli and zucchini.  And At the end, I always pur?e at least 2 to 3 cups and it is simply the best soup. I also double the recipe because in my household it disappears quickly!!!!! Oh and I always use reduced fat Mexican mixed cheese, like Sargento. Bon Appetite!!!!"
5.0,Diced a small onion and sweated it along with carrots (diced) and celery in 1 tbsp margerine for about 5 minutes.Followed remainder of recipe and turned out absolutely delicious.
5.0,It tastes really good. You must like the combinations.
5.0,This was really good! I added ground sausage and some onion. Will definitely be making again.
5.0,This is sooo good  And it&#39;s wonderful for the cold nights when you are tired and you are also vegetarian.  I add a corn muffin and voila!
5.0,We loved this soup...served it to a friend and he thought it was excellent. Turned out he hated cauliflower and hadn&#39;t eaten any since he was a kid. This soup changed his mind!
5.0,This soup is really good!  Had to thicken it just a bit but it may have been that I added too much water. I chose not to use the hot sauce and it was great on this very cold night. This is a keeper!
5.0,Made this tonight and it was a BIG hit the whole family gave it 5 stars! My daughter said this recipe is a keeper!
5.0,So it I decide to use chicken broth instead I don&#39;t use any water right?
5.0,"Made this for dinner tonight.  It was awesome.  I added the hot sauce while cooking and a couple of dashes to my bowl.  The recipe worked perfectly, is was quick and easy.  This is a keeper."
5.0,"Easy to make, creamy &amp; oh so good!!!  The only thing I added was a bit of onion.  Great on a cold winter day!"
5.0,"My goal this winter is to try one new soup recipe each week. This one was very easy, tasty, and healthy. This soup is low enough in carbs to be very good for anyone who is diabetic or counting carbs. This is a quick meal; while the vegetables are cooking I made the white sauce. I used a vegetable base rather than bouillon to cut out the MSG found in most bouillons. I used 1/2 tsp. of hot sauce; if you like a little spicier taste, add the entire teaspoon. Definitely a keeper of a recipe!!"
5.0,"loved this!! Easy to make, I left out the hot sauce, maybe next time i will try it with it but i really liked it with out so not sure"
5.0,I love this soup. It is so quick and easy and is always a hit. I serve it whenever I have to whip up something healthy in a hurry. Have added corn on occasion as well. Yum. I usually do biscuits or scones to go with this soup and rarely is there leftovers. I&#39;ve added this recipe to my huge list of favourite soups.
5.0,"I have made this soup several times. We love it!  I have also substituted broccoli for the cauliflower. We belong to a co-op and sometimes we get cauliflower,sometimes broccoli. Both are yummy in this soup."
5.0,"Very simple and quick to make! I omit the salt, and use 1/2 mild cheddar and 1/2 sharp cheddar cheese. So tasty!"
5.0,"This was very good soup.  I used all boxed chicken broth in place of the water &amp; no chicken bouillon cube.  I added 1/2 diced onion, broccoli chopped pieces, 2 diced Yukon gold potatoes, &amp; 2 garlic cloves.  I also used half &amp; half in place of the milk.  I was trying to copy a restaurant&#39;s recipe.  This was very close &amp; the soup went quickly."
5.0,"Easy &amp; delicious.  I&#39;ve made it with cauliflower as the main ingredient, and also combined cauliflower with broccoli.  Very good each time.  Goes great with any sort of sandwich."
5.0,"Great! Super easy and quick. I added additional chopped celery and carrots. Along with the chicken bouillon, I used some boxed chicken broth in place of some of the water. In equal amounts, I increased all the ingredients to compensate for the added vegetables. YUM!!"
5.0,EXCELLENT soup! Everyone in the family loved the soup - even my 3 year old who hates eating her vegetables. I added quite a bit more of each of the vegetables and doubled the rest of the recipe. Definitely worth a try.
5.0,"Great soup!  It was very thick, and although I didn&#39;t mind it, others commented so I added some more milk to thin it out."
5.0,I made this on a Sunday morning for lunch later on.  It smelled so good my 12 yr old son had some for breakfast!!!!   Its a huge hit and I love how he is getting several servings of vegies and calcium.  The only thing I changed was I pureed about a cup of the cauliflower mixture before I added the milk cheese mixture.  It was awesome!!!!  Plus I love the fact that the recipe came from Chilliwack.  My relatives all come from BC and I have spent many beautiful cool fall nights at Cultus Lake.  This soup is perfect for fall.  Thanks Debbie!
5.0,"My husband is not a fan of cauliflower but this recipe got a thumbs up from him. For a little added protein, I am going to add chicken. He wants a touch of cayenne. I plan to do both. Loved this soup!"
5.0,It was wonderful.
5.0,"I&#39;ve just recently begun to cook, and even the simplest things seem overwhelming for me. This soup, however, was as simple as can be, and turned out to be delicious! I made it for my family, and got some compliments (even the four-year-old ate it)!"
5.0,"This is literally the best soup recipe I&#39;ve ever made.  I keep making it, freezing it, remaking it... I&#39;m a big fan of onions so I choose to caramelize some onions in the main pan to add a little more of a flavor layer, but it&#39;s great with or without it.   MAKE THIS SOUP!"
5.0,"I used fat free chicken broth, fat free cheddar cheese and fat free milk, it was still fantastic!!!!"
5.0,"Easy to make, very filling and VERY good."
5.0,"This is a favorite of ours.  I do add a chopped onion, just because we like it, and if I&#39;m in a rush, I just chop the carrot."
5.0,"The girls all asked for seconds.  Great way to get the veges in.  The base of the soup was great.  We sauted all the vegetables and added onion, a yellow pepper, doubled the celery, parsley, seasoning salt.  The girls recommended blending half and leaving half chucky.  Would definetly make again."
5.0,I was really impressed with this recipe. It is very flavorful. I followed the recipe exactly except used sriracha sauce because I did not have other hot sauce and I used 1% milk instead of 2%. Pleased with how it turned out and would make it again.
5.0,"This was awesome!!! Followed recipe to almost exactly, except added more flour at the end mixed with 1/2 cup milk to thicken a bit more. My husband who has never eaten cauliflower thought it was great as well. Thanks for a great fast recipe."
5.0,"My son&#39;s favorite soup.  Try with an orange cauliflower from farmers market, it&#39;s outstanding."
5.0,"Very pleased with this soup. I did &#34;doctor&#34; it up a bit. Added more cheese, dried onion, and some poultry seasoning. Will be making this again."
5.0,"Comfort food without guilt!   I made one substitution: no cheddar cheese in the fridge, so I used asiago cheese.  Wow! A little more upscale taste nuance, probably a better cheese to use when serving this soup to adult guests than for the children maybe.  I can image adding maybe a dash of nutmeg to this recipe...."
5.0,"This is really good.  I usually make a potato soup similar, but my husband has type 2 diabetes, this is a great alternative!  Actually I think we like it better.  I wouldn&#39;t change a thing.  I serve it with crispy bacon and cheese on top."
5.0,great soup used chicken stock and some vegetable stock instead of water. also used half and half for the milk with flour makes thicker. thanks for recipe
5.0,So good....my family really enjoyed it.  Served it with bread.  Didn&#39;t change anything from the original recipe and omitted the hot sauce.
5.0,"This soup is so good! It&#39;s really quick and easy to make...great for a busy mom. I added closer to a cup and a half of cheese, just to finish out the bag (plus I love cheese) and the flavor was really nice. Great soup to beat the winter blues :)"
5.0,This was superb. I did saute all the ingredients (plus a clove of garlic) first in a little olive oil before adding the broth/water. Made it even more flavorful....
5.0,"I live where you can buy cauliflower from the farmer, huge head for $2. Enough for batch and a half. So this is so inexpensive to make and SO delicious. I didn&#39;t have any celery so I chopped up a few cabbage leaves. Will definately make it again."
5.0,"I sauteed a little bit of onions in the butter and used light cheese and skim milk, omitted the salt and thought it was still great!"
5.0,"Delicious, quick and easy.  I would definitely make again."
5.0,This soup is delicious!!  I keep cracked black pepper on the table with this recipe.
5.0,I had a head of cauliflower in my frig that I needed to use up so I decided to look online to see if I could find a good recipe.  So glad I did.  Actually had all of the ingredients for this soup and it is delicious!  The only complaint I had was it could have been a little thicker but that can be easily solved.  Loved the flavor so that&#39;s the most important thing.
5.0,"I&#39;ve probably made this recipe a dozen times since I first found it. It gets raves from everyone I&#39;ve served it to, and I find it velvety and absolutely wonderful. Thanks for posting, Debbie!"
5.0,One  of the best soups I&#39;ve ever made!  I added some fresh dill..delicious!  Even my son (who is not a soup lover) loved this soup!!!!!
5.0,My husband and I really liked this soup.  I added onion and I also thickened it with extra flour/water mixture at the end of cooking.  I didn&#39;t measure my cheese but I&#39;m sure I went a little heavy on that too.  We added the hot sauce to our bowls and we liked it very much.  This recipe is a keeper!
5.0,excellent!
5.0,"Made this recipe for the first time tonight, turned out great, I did use chicken broth instead of bullion and water and blended the veggies up before adding the cheese sauce. My picky 1 and 3 year olds devoured it, will be making it again."
5.0,"Both my husband and I loved this recipe. I did add Smoked Paprika and a little more chicken broth. Also, I used goats milk and part skim part skim Mozzarella cheese as thats what I had on hand."
5.0,"I usually use my bread maker, but this recipe was easy and fun and the end results were fantastic.  I will make this again!"
5.0,Perfect recipe for making Newfoundland Toutons.
5.0,Has anyone tried letting it finish the final rise overnight in the fridge before baking in the morning?
5.0,"This is a great recipe!  My boyfriend loves home made bread, so I thought I&#39;d try this one, and it turned out great!  I&#39;m very happy with the end results!"
5.0,"I have made this a number of times and love it.  Because I have only myself to feed, I cook the vegetables as shown but put half of it in the freezer for another day.  I make half of the milk, etc. mixture each batch.  Simple and satisfying."
5.0,Delish!
5.0,This has become my absolute favorite soup!
5.0,This was wonderful. I used fat free milk and fat free cheese for a healthy version and it was great. The taste was great.
5.0,"There were no leftovers.  Everyone had seconds, and it was delicious."
5.0,Very good comfort food.
5.0,This was delicious! I made it just as the recipe said and I did put in a tiny amount of hot pepper sauce. We loved it
5.0,This  soup is a winner ..wonderful and filling soup on a cold day;... replaced the water with Swanson&#39;s chicken broth and used half n half... really satisfying..this is a quick and delicious soup.
5.0,"This came out fabulous! Love this recipe, both loaves were fluffy and the crust was perfect. Thank you so much!"
5.0,"I like this recipe because it’s easy to keep up with and isn’t written in a convoluted story format and the website doesn’t make you click next page and next page. This website is less clickbait than the other top of google bread recipes. 

The bread comes out good, if you like a hard crust and soft spongy center. My girlfriend says it’s too salty so I’m trying it with half the recipe recommended amount of salt. I thought the salt was fine but I want her to eat the bread too so, less salt. And I tried it with honey instead of sugar, but it didn’t look like the yeast reacted to the honey the same way as sugar. The yeast kind of climbed on to the honey but wasn’t bubbling, so I put sugar in there with the honey too. I will probably try using more yeast and seeing if that makes the bread more fluffy too next time. 

This recipe is a good baseline to go off of and you’ll probably want to make adjustments to your taste."
5.0,"Perfect bread starter. I do add ins black garlic, onion flakes, pepper, powdered onion and garlic. Also used as base for raisin bread. The options are endless."
5.0,I use this recipe for my jalepeno cheese bread also I love this recipe
5.0,"This bread is great. I haven&#39;t made anything &#34;yeasty&#34; in a very long time..... Easy and TASTY. Several reviews stated it was salty so I decreased the salt, MISTAKE, use 1 T as the recipe states and I used a lot less flour also. I live in assisted living and the residents liked the bread! Slathered pieces in real butter.....YUM! Make this bread!"
5.0,"I have been making the basic homemade bread and enjoying the 2 loaves.  If I half the recipe to make one loaf, do I half all ingredients??  Even the yeast??  ... which means I only use 1-1/8 teaspoon??  Please advice.  Thanks for all recipes!!"
5.0,This is a great recipe. I use high end garlic flavored EVOO instead of Canola oil to give it a garlic flavor and I use Caputo Italian Chef&#39;s Flour 00 and the bread is super light and fluffy.
5.0,Is there anything better than homemade fresh warm bread smothered with butter? Definitely not. This bread is so delicious and so easy! Sure to impress any guests and yourself!
5.0,It came out much better than I thought. It was a little to wet at first so I added more flour when kneading. It was delicious. I am no baker but this recipe  gave me hope
5.0,"Despite my relative novice level this turned out good! What made me select this recipe is the homemade bread tips that Taste of Home provided. I enjoyed the simplicity, which made the recipe more approachable. My first attempt was a fail and was completely my fault because I didn&#39;t check the expiration date on my yeast (which I knew after reading the Tips). The second attempt was so much better and gives me hope that I can get even better results. I didn&#39;t have bread flour so I just used regular all-purpose flour. My family enjoyed the bread as well!"
5.0,I’ve made bread before so nothing was new. But it was fun to have hot bread as part of our meal. The family loved it and it made me realize how really easy it is. Just THINK AND PLAN AHEAD and you can give real treat to the ones you love!!
5.0,I have made this all over the world and everyone loves it...my daughter does crockpots full at college and always gets requests to make it again.

5.0,"The only change I made to the recipe was to cut back the cumin to 1/2 tsp.  My husband is not a white chili fan, but he absolutely loved this chili.  It is now on the menu for the night we do soups during the Christmas holiday with the extended family!"

5.0,This white chili is excellent!  I found this recipe in a Maine newspaper while on vacation many many years ago and clipped it out to take home to Virginia and try.  It was a big hit and since then we have won 1st Place in many Chili contests over the other traditional red chili&#39;s.  The men at my husbands work ask for me to make this every year when winter rolls around as a treat.  Definitely a keeper to impress the boss or anyone.

5.0,"My favorite soup, so easy to make and tastes fantastic.  I make this very often during the winter time.  I use pre-cooked, chunked chicken breasts instead of cooking it in the pan."

5.0,I made this on a cold Saturday while my hubby was putting up Christmas lights on the house. I used fake crab (instead of chicken) since I had that on hand and needed to be consumed. It made a really good soup-fast. Next time I will make it as stated with chicken but I would not hesitate with the substitution I used either! Nice recipe- thanks

5.0,"I changed the recipe slightly by only using 1/2 can of chilies, about 1 1/2 cans of beans, 1/2 an onion, and 1/4 tsp cumin.  I also used fat free sour cream and added a tbsp of butter at the end... it was DELISH!!!"

5.0,"This is quick, easy and fool proof. I&#39;ve made this recipe 4 times now and the loaves are perfect each time. They freeze well too and are easy to slice. Great for sandwiches."
5.0,"This was the first homemade bread recipe I have ever tried and it was so worth it! This is a very time consuming recipe, but well worth the wait.  It&#39;s actually a simple recipe that is easy to follow and make; the resting time for the dough just takes a bit.  Wonderful recipe! Tastes so good!"
5.0,"Perfect! I am not in any way a professional baker (I am more of a newbie), and this bread is so easy to make! Rather than kneading on a counter, I just kept the dough in the standmixer and used the dough hook.... turns out great! Thank you so much for this recipe! :) The family loves it!"
5.0,"A nice easy recipe, which I always double.  Vegan, too, if you don&#39;t butter the hot crust when it comes out (which I do!) Our Noble Homestead go-to recipe. Mmmm. Proudly served at the Magic Glamp, with an olive oil substitution."
5.0,"I love to bake, so I&#39;ve tried many different basic bread recipes. All of the ones I&#39;ve made turn out too gooey on the inside (not thoroughly cooked) or too hard and crunchy. Additionally, there are so many ingredients and it takes forever to make a loaf of bread. This bread is the best bread I&#39;ve ever had in. my. life. It is such an easy recipe, with only 6 ingredients, and it takes 20 minutes to whip up, aside from rising + baking time. The flavor is wonderful and the smell of baking bread fills the house. 10/10 for this recipe. AMAZING!"
5.0,This was my very first attempt to make bread of any kind. It was easy to do and came out perfect. I actually made mine in the air fryer and cooked it at 325 x 18 minutes. The texture was perfect and it wasn’t too dense. I followed the recipe exactly except for using the air fryer oven.
5.0,"This is the best bread I’ve ever made.  Found this recipe about 3weeks ago and just made my 7th batch this morning, hubby can’t stop eating this."
5.0,"Absolutely love this recipe , thankyou so much this bread is exactly how I wanted my bread to be ??"
5.0,"I don&#39;t know where this recipe was last year. I scoured the internet looking for a recipe with a 9 x 5 pan. I used 4 cups of white bread flour and added in enough whole wheat flour to make the dough and got two soft, perfect loaves."
5.0,A great recipe! They came out beautifully!! Will use recipe again.
5.0,First bread I ever baked without a machine. It came out great. I’m glad I had years of the bread machine experience so that I knew what the consistency was supposed to be during the 7-minute kneading.
5.0,"I started baking bread again last June. This was the first recipe I used and it is the base for every bread I&#39;ve made since.  It is so easy to add ingredients or swap one thing for another. Each time the bread has been a success. I&#39;ve made garlic kalamata olive bread, chocolate granola bread, and several other variations. But at its heart its always this basic recipe. Thanks."
5.0,easy recipe to follow. I used bread flour and weighted my flour and used rapid yeast. It raised beautifully both times. I also used my proof feature of my oven. This recipe is a keeper. Thank you.
5.0,This bread is excellent.  Easy to follow recipe.
5.0,Wonderful recipe....yummy
5.0,"Hey tasteofhome fans, I finally found a splinter free quality banneton proofing basket. I used it already twice, it works great and is extremely easy to clean :-) https://amzn.to/333eZke Enjoy your homemade bread!"
5.0,New to baking. This one was easy and delicious!
5.0,Just baked my first loaves of bread.   This is a simple and foolproof recipe!  Turned out delicious!!
5.0,I’ve tried many white bread recipes and this is the only one I make now. I make this weekly and it’s got a lovely texture. Toasts up amazing! Nice and easy and I make croutons out of the end piece. Keeps brilliantly in the fridge and perfect for sandwiches.
5.0,I&#39;m new to bread making. I&#39;ve tried two other breads before this one and this one is my favorite. My family enjoys this bread and it&#39;s very easy to make. I did not use a bread pan and my loaves baked nicely. It does not state whether to preheat the oven or not. I preheated it. I will not buy store bought bread again unless I am in a pinch. Great recipe!
5.0,This bread is super easy to make! Made it for my family and friends and they said it was the best bread they ever had!
5.0,"Such a great recipe and easy for this beginner to follow. You saved our Christmas! Last year my mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#39;s and she&#39;s the one that made Christmas with her cooking and baking. Dad has been her caregiver ever since and has been cooking like a champ. My husband and I live 2min. away, and my brother is staying with them and has been a huge help. But none of us were ready for the holidays... Not really  Last year I did NOTHING. This year we cooked what we wanted instead of trying to mimic what mom did.  Fried catfish and shrimp, anyone?I also was able to make homemade bread and ham for the family. A tradition that&#39;s been in place for as long as I can remember and I&#39;m 50. They loved it! Thank you 1000x and happy holidays!"
5.0,Super easy starter recipe for any nonbakers!  turned out perfectly and my family gobbled it up.  Currently making more!
5.0,I made this yesterday and had some today for breakfast. First time making bread and it was awesome. My wife really enjoyed it too and said don’t freeze the 2nd loaf because it won’t last...
5.0,"I really enjoy this recipe. It&#39;s my go-to. My only question is regarding the nutritional content. It says 1 slice, can you give the weight of one slice? 1 slice can vary in size. Thank you."
5.0,"It was my first time to bake bread, the recipe was easy to follow had great results. The bread was perfect my family loved it."
5.0,"I’m now rating this recipe but I’ve been using this one for the last 3 months- this recipe is amazing. We tweaked by adding raw oats and crushed flaxseed to make it a little more healthy. It came out really well. This recipe for us yielded 2 nice loaves, and when we toasted the slices for breakfast, the flavor of the oats and flaxseed made it even more delicious- it feels like we had it in a café! Thank you for this, we don’t buy bread anymore!"
5.0,"One of my first times making bread and this recipe yielded two fantastic loafs. I was initially worried because the rise was quicker that the recipe said (first one doubled in 50 minutes and the second in 40) and the bread was much bigger than anticipated but overall it tasted really good. Also the recipe doesnt estimate a cook time, for me it was 1 hour and 25 minutes at 190°C"
5.0,It has become my go to recipe and have used this recipe several times.   Love it! Thanks!
5.0,"I was looking for an easy, foolproof bread recipe that did not require a bread machine.  This was perfect.  After making it according to the recipe the first time I got brave and added shredded coconut and some coconut extract to a batch.  Worked great.  Next I tried it chopped toasted almonds and almond extract - super good.  Will keep using this as my foundation as I try a few more variations."
5.0,Great recipe!
5.0,"Great basic bread recipe. Easy even if you are so so at following directions. I left to rise a bit too long but it still turned out like the photo. Not too many bubbles for me on the yeast either, but again, turned out like the photo. I baked 35 minutes. The hollow sound didn&#39;t sound hollow to me, it sounded dense to me but then again I don&#39;t know what to listen for as an amateur. Either way, it turned out great despite some slight deviations on my part. This really makes you think about wtf they are putting into store bought bread to make it that light texture, talk about diluting the mixture with garbage! The store bread you pay $2 or more per loaf for and is marked up and low quality. It is worth way less than that and I made this quality bread for about 1.66  per batch . 83 cents per loaf at 33 cents for yeast, 2.50 for 5 lb bag flour, divided., at 3 1/3 cups per pound, using 6 1/4 cups. You could get even cheaper if you wanted to buy in bulk but that isn&#39;t necessary as you only save a few cents and then you have to make A LOT of bread before the yeast expires. I&#39;d experiment by putting Everything Seasoning on the top of it, Caraway seeds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seed pits, the list goes on. The bread is hearty for refined white bread flour and crusty, not soft and easy to puncture than the store crap! Good luck! Youtube: LCatRN"
5.0,"Just a question:  Do we have to preheat our convention oven for this? If we have to, how much and how long should we set it for?"
5.0,1st time I tried it Thank you perfect
5.0,"I have baked Homemade Bread for Many Years. This Recipe yielded me The Very Best Loaves of Bread I have Ever Made. The thing I done Different this time was I used ALL BREAD FLOUR. Historically I used All Purpose Flour. While my Bread always turned out Well, the Crust was very Hard and the Bread was Dense, but I never had any Leftovers. This Recipe and using BREAD FLOUR my Bread Top was Soft and my Bread was Light as it is from The Grocery Store. I was Amazed but I Recommend Trying This Recipe and Use Bread Flour Only. After it comes out of The Oven, Brush the Tops with Melted Butter. I hope You Enjoy Making Your Bread and that it Turns Out Perfectly As Mine Did. Thanks for Providing Home Cooks with A Great Recipe."

5.0,"I found this recipe September 2010.  It&#39;s December 19th 2010 and I&#39;m making it for the 3rd time.  The first time I made it my mom had some and loved it and has made it probably 6 times since she tried it.  My wife whom doesn&#39;t really care for chili loves it.  It&#39;s really one of those things that sounds strange in your head. . Chili with chicken?  Hrm.. I dunno.  Just try it.  It makes you nervous to try it, because it seems odd, but once you try it, it&#39;s awesome!  No one in my family are huge onion people, so I always get a small onion and probably only use 3/4 of it, and I chop them up really tiny.  This way the onions are not overpowering, but I think it would be missing something without them, so I wouldn&#39;t leave them out.  "

5.0,Just made this and it turned out great considering I didnt have all the correct ingredients. I halved the quantities as I only wanted one loaf and used half self raising flour and half 00 pasta flour as that was all I had and Im pretty sure my yeast was dead as it was out of date and didn&#39;t bubble!! But it worked! Only ever made soda bread before so this was a great result for me as a first time bread baker!!
5.0,"Yeast seems to be in short supply right now so I found this recipe while searching for a recipe that used only one packet of yeast. I made no changes to the recipe and ended up with two beautiful and tasty loaves of bread. I found the video to be very helpful also. My usual recipe calls for two packets of yeast. This bread takes longer to make, but is just as good. I let it rise in the bowl for raw full two hours and for 1.5 hrs. in the pans."
5.0,"This recipe is absolutely amazing! The bread comes out super brown and my house literally smells like a bakery! I’m so glad I discovered this recipe before quarantine! To those that are struggling, try again and in my opinion, Do everything in one bowl."
5.0,Just finished baking this bread.  Easy recipe and great results!!!  Have baked other bread (and much more difficult) recipes in the past and haven’t had as much success as with this one!

It tasted like fresh, delicious store bought (soft warm) Italian bread...this is going to be a new favorite recipe of mine for sure! My husband loved it!!!! Incredibly delicious. The proofing takes some time, but all the steps were very easy to follow. Thank you so much!!! I love it!!!!"
5.0,I am by no means a baker last time I made bread was 5 yrs ago I know this because my mom passed in 2015. This recipe is easy and tastes wonderful.  Tip since yeast is the new toilet paper during this virus find a local bake shop and ask them is you can buy some yeast I found fresh and it had expired and worked beautifully just proof it like active dry yeast. Cheer and good luck.
5.0,This was my first ever attempt at baking bread. The recipe was easy to follow and I had fun baking. Great first time exoerience. I mixed my flour with some wheat four and the bread came out perfectly.
5.0,"Fantastic bread recipe. It takes our family about three days to go through a loaf of bread so I refrigerated half the dough after kneading it the first time. It continues to rise in the fridge so make sure you put it in a container with room for it to double and a tight fitting lid. Took it out today, punched it down, shaped for the second loaf and continued the recipe from there - it turned out perfectly!"
5.0,I have made this bread a couple times and love it.. I only had rapid rise yeast.. So i only had to let it rise once.. I just put all the ingredients in a stand up mixer bowl together and mix and then add my bread attachment and finish adding the flower.. After you mix it and if you use Rapid yeast let it rest for 10 minutes then cut in half put in the pan and let rise and turn the oven on and bake them.. Best bread recipe ever..
5.0,We love this basic bread. It turned out perfectly and taste wonderful!! It&#39;s a keeper
5.0,This recipe is great! I have never made bread before. Aside from quick breads like banana and zucchini. Its was easy and tastes AMAZING. Suzanne I don&#39;t see any reason the old fashioned way wouldn&#39;t work. It will just be a bit more effort on your part when it comes to the incorporating.
5.0,First time making it and it turned out great! My family loves it
5.0,This message is for Suzanne:  I&#39;ve made the bread with a standup mixer and by hand.  Both times the bread turned out fine.  It was just a little easier with my Kitchen Aid.
5.0,"This is the only bread recipe that ALWAYS works . I followed the instructions exactly using bread flour , combinations of white flour and whole wheat flour, as well as millet or lentil flour along with white flour and it has always risen beautifully. I have been baking bread every 4 days and get 2 perfect loaves EVERY TIME . Thank you for this great recipe ."
5.0,"I absolutely love this recipe. I made this bread last night and family was shocked today because it was so good. They never knew I could bake bread, actually, I never knew I could bake bread. It&#39;s awesome! We are making more today so that both my daughters can learn how to do it. ??"
5.0,"Can’t believe for a simple recipe how great this bread tastes. I do use a mixer and dough hook and it turns out fine.  The only time I buy bread now is if I’m lazy and looking for a way out?  So far I haven’t boughten any.  One loaf I freeze for the following week, so it’s only every two weeks I need to bake.  Highly recommend this recipe both for the beginner and seasoned pro."
5.0,"Fantastic recipe! it was really easy. I mixed by hand. I substituted in about 1 cup of semolina flour, since I am running low on strong flour due to the flour &#34;shortage&#34;. It was fine, texture and flavour were excellentl. My kids LOVED it and one loaf was gone within 30 minutes!"
5.0,What started as a joke between my mom and my cousins turned into an amazing joke. I made the bread today and it was delicious. Easy to follow and amazing taste. Definitely a keeper!!!
5.0,My family loves this chili.  Its simple &amp; so yummy in the Indiana winters!

5.0,"I made this for a football party and I sent two people home with the recipe. As extra fixings, I had monterey jack cheese &amp; cilantro out, as well as the cayenne pepper for those who like it just a little bit spicier! It was fantastic. Will definitely make this again!"

5.0,I made this yesterday for a Chili &amp; Soup Church Supper. It deserves all the stars it has been given.  It was absolute delicious.  I doubled the recipe except for the cayenne pepper and it was just the right spiciness for everyone.  I will definitely be making this again and again.

5.0,My son-in-law made this for us over the Christmas holiday.  I didn&#39;t think I would like it but I was pleasantly surprised.  It is the perfect comfort food and great for a crowd.  I would have never thought there was as much great flavor in it as there is!

5.0,Just made it for my first time and love the mix of flavors.  Very tasty.  A great recipe for those cold winter days when you want something to warm your insides.  Delicious!! I will be making this again and again... Have already sent the recipe link to all of my friends on Facebook... Yummy!!

5.0,"Fantastic!  My husband loves spicy foods, but the kids and I do not.  So I compromised and used half the called-for amounts of both the green chiles and the cayenne.  The result was a dish that was a hit across the board!  After the first bite, all were requesting that this become a regular on our family dinner table."
5.0,First time attempting bread.  This recipe worked great even with whole wheat flower.  Turned out awesome!!
5.0,Easy recipe to follow; nice textured bread.
5.0,"I was super excited to try and make this bread recipe because it was my first time, the process was a bit frustrating but the end result was perfect really liked and so did my friends"
5.0,"I made this recipe as directed, turned out almost perfect. I love it!! The next time I mad it I did not have the Active Dry Yeast. I substituted rapid yeast ( aka instant yeas) and the bread turned out even better. I did not change anything except of activating the yeast. Really fluffy and still full bodied. There is a slight change in flavor, it is has a little less yeast smell, but not anything to change my mind.  I highly recommend this recipe, especially for the first time baker. this is almost fool proof"
5.0,This recipe is easy and l nailed it the first time will never buy bread again
5.0,"I never succeeded at making bread until I used this recipe. I highly suggest you follow the link on how to proof your bread. What a difference it made! I never watched the video, I simply followed the written directions."
5.0,"This recipe is AMAZING!!! I am a complete Newbie when it comes to bread. I can make pizza dough like a pro but bread has always intimidated me.  Using bread flour in my recipe was my first priority, second was no milk or egg.  This recipe was easy to follow and ended up with a bread better than the bakery (my picky eater&#39;s words)!  I used a dough hook on my mixer and after was pulled together, i hand kneaded it for about 4 minutes longer.  The most perfect bread ever!!!  Don&#39;t be intimidated, just follow written directions fully.  ONLY thing I would add is to put the rack toward the bottom so the &#34;poof&#34; of the bread is in the middle of the oven when it&#39;s risen and browning.  THANK YOU AGAIN!!!"
5.0,loved it and it was easy!
5.0,This was my 1st time making homemade bread.  Complete success!!  It came out perfect.
5.0,"Hi! I love making bread. I used to make it the standard way, I found an old fleishman booklet that had two ways to make it. I like the sponge method. But still my bread (2nd day) is crumbly and heavy. Any suggestions?"
5.0,Super easy! Tastes great!
5.0,"Paige- whole wheat flour absorbs more water than white white flour. So, either you need to increase the amount of water or decrease the amount of flour. I&#39;d you want to keep a similar texture, you can try substituting 50-70% of the white flour for whole wheat flour."
5.0,Amazingly good
5.0,"Bread tastes amazing!  However, time is misleading on the recipe since it needs a few hours to rise.  Any other time I read recipes completely before making them but I was in a rush and didnt until half way thru... I only jad about an hour to let it rise and then put in oven.  Still turned out great and everyone loved it.  I did add just about 1/2 c of whole wheat flour."
5.0,The house smelled amazing while this was baking. Absolutely thought I had died and gone to heaven with my first slice.  It also makes very good toast. You will never need another white bread recipe
5.0,"I had seen this recipe and then lost it so was going from memort.  I used 2 pks of yeast instead of 1- it was fantastic!!  Chewy, soft, and that yeadty flavor I love.  This makes a wonderful  base for cinnamon rolls- hint hint!"
5.0,Outstanding and simple bread.  The taste is terrific.  I have one package of yeast left during the pandemic so we are eating the bread sparingly.  Nobody has any yeast!  Great bread.
5.0,Just came out of the oven and we have eaten half of the first loaf.  It&#39;s delicious.
5.0,"This recipe guideline was easy to use with amazing results! The bread is delicious and going on day 2 still fresh and moist. It was my first try, I&#39;ve never baked bread before and I was thrilled with the results. Try out this recipe it is good!"
5.0,"Fantastic!  My husband loves spicy foods, but the kids and I do not.  So I compromised and used half the called-for amounts of both the green chiles and the cayenne.

5.0,Yummy!  Used light sour cream &amp; fat free half &amp; half and still tastes great.

5.0,"This is a keeper! I substituted what I had in the house, so I used 2 chicken boullion cubes in 2 cups water and 1/2 evaporated milk for the whip cream...It was DELICIOUS!  I will make smaller chicken pieces next time so there is chicken in every bite.  Highly recommend this recipe."

5.0,"So good! Now I know what to make when I have to bring a dish to a potluck. This is so easy and so delicious, just as given. I plan to take leftovers and add peas, layer with pasta and breadcrumbs, and bake -- it&#39;s that rich! "
5.0,"This is a great fast bread recipe. And to answer one of the questions below, yes you can use a stand mixer.  I used the whisk for the initial mixing and then switched to the kneading hook for the 8-10 minutes suggested in the recipe. Turned out fantastic."
5.0,used olive oil instead
5.0,"This is the first bread recipe I have made that did not come out rubbery or extremely dense.  I was impressed.  After watching the video, I realized my dough was not the proper consistency according to the flour and liquid ratio in the recipe.  I only used 5 1/4 cups of flour, as 6  was far too much and did not mix well.   I will make this again as it was delicious. I feel like an instant bread expert.  Thank you!"
5.0,"Love this bread! My wife and family also love this delicious sandwich bread. Definitely doesn&#39;t require all of the flour. I used around 5 cups. Everything else is spot on though. To quote Holly- I felt like an instant bread expert. I have already made this recipe 2xs. The first time with all purpose flour, came out dry and spongy. The second time I used baking flour, and the bread was perfect. Crisp yet chewy. Thank you."
5.0,"Absolutely one of the best, lightest, tastiest white breads I have ever made (and there&#39;s been a few).  Thank you to Steve for the suggestion regarding flour, started out with 6 cups and added as needed/kneaded ended up with the whole 6 3/4 cups.  The only thing I did different was I used a couple of tips I had from various cinnamon roll recipes that work.  The first one being heat liquid for yeast in the microwave, starting with 1 minute then add 10 to 20 more seconds until you reach 110-115 deg f., then add yeast and 1/2 tsp sugar.  While mixing ingredients for dough heat oven to 200 deg f. then turn off and allow to cool slightly, then put the dough in there to raise (door closed). I use a metal bowl and cover with a damp towel.  Left in there for full 2 hrs and when it came time to put into pans I covered them and put back in the oven until it was time to preheat for baking.  I haven&#39;t had an issue with dough rising since I started using this method, as long as yeast is before &#34;best by&#34; date."
5.0,The amount of flour is a SUGGESTION.  I used to make bread every Friday and just getting back to it so I knew that. Depending upon the humidity sometimes I use 6c or 6.5c or 5.75c. Finish adding the flour during the hand kneading process and you&#39;ll never go wrong
5.0,"A very good recipe for nice sandwich bread. Obviously, the amount of flour and water depends very much on the temperature, humidity, and elevation, so it would have been helpful to be very specific about what the dough should look and feel like at each stage, since this is a beginner’s recipe.  But it makes great bread!  If you want rustic bread, I swear by the recipe on the King Arthur flour website.  It’s absolutely foolproof.  I’m a mediocre baker, but I’ve never messed up that recipe, ever."
5.0,"Fantastic recipe! I followed the recipe and it turned out prefect.  My first time making bread, I did YouTube on activating yeast and how to tell when you have knead enough.  Very good flavor and great for beginners."
5.0,"Tasty, easy to follow recipe! My family definitely approved. Yum delicious ??"
5.0,I don&#39;t buy bread at the store. All the crap you buy there and most of the flour mixes have bromate. SO I finally decided to buy bromate free flour and try to cook..(( wait is it took or make or make??) Make bread. It was easier than I thought it would be to make.. Its rising right now.. Kinda huge.. I realized though that I don&#39;t have any bread pans so.. this is going to be an interesting experiment... Going to toss it on a cookie sheet and.. eat what happens.   I like that the recipe was so easy. I don&#39;t like the ads I have to scroll through in the middle of the page.   I&#39;ll try this again next week.. I think
5.0,This was such an easy recipe and the result was awesome! Im super impressed.  I&#39;ve tried a bunch of recipes and this is a winner!
5.0,I MADE YOUR RECIPE AND IT IS THE BEST. I LOVE IT. MADE SOME THIS MORNING AND WE ATE AWESOME SANDWICHES FOR LUNCH. YES. THANK YOU AND BLESS YOU.
5.0,Best recipe I have tried and I have been trying to find a really good bread recipe for a long time.  The bread is light and fluffy.  Thank you. My search is st an end
5.0,"My wife and I made this bread tonight....AMAZING!  Unbelievably awesome. First time making it, is and our three kids are hooked! Thank you!"
5.0,Have been using this recipe for years and I love it! Always consistently good bread!
5.0,This is a wonderful recipe to make. It&#39;s easy
5.0,This is a five star recipe all the way its a perfect recipe every time and everyone loves it including me!!!
5.0,"I use this recipe as a template. As an experienced baker, I can make numerous modifications with a recipe this basic. To answer some other concerns, it is helpful to start with the yeast and two cups of flour and add the liquid ingredients before you add salt and let sit about ten minutes. This fully activated the yeast and can improve results. To the person whose bread came out doughy, have you confirmed your oven temperature is accurate? Often, home ranges can vary in actual temperature."
5.0,My bread used to always come out either really dry or way too dense and chewy.  This is the first recipe that gives me consistently good results!  Now I use it as a base and make little alterations to experiment in the kitchen.  I&#39;ve got a lemon pepper garlic bread rising now!
5.0,Can you make this with out a mixer and have it still come out fine?
5.0,"So good! Now I know what to make when I have to bring a dish to a potluck. This is so easy and so delicious, just as given. I plan to take leftovers and add peas, layer with pasta and breadcrumbs, and bake -- it&#39;s that rich!"
5.0,This is such good Chili.  I love it and so does my family.
5.0,This is such good Chili.  I love it and so does my family.
5.0,A favorite! I have never made this for company without being asked for the recipe...don&#39;t need to tweak a thing!
5.0,"made this recipe as written, and it was delicious!  I even got a &#34;this is *really* good&#34; from my husband.  The taste is wonderful, and it is totally going into my recipe box!"
5.0,Perfect dish for a snow day!
5.0,"This is seriously an AMAZING recipe! It was spicy, creamy and good on a cold Alaskan night.  Next time I will probably use half &amp; half or 2% milk instead of the heavy cream, no salt (you dont even need it) and greek yogurt instead of sour cream to make it more healthy. and I am sure it will still be amazing! mmmmmm.... Oh and double it if you want a second meal out of it because ours did not make the 7 servings it stated it would."
5.0,AMAZING! Everyone in my house loves it! I have to double the recipe...sometimes triple it!
5.0,"I added red pepper with onions in the beginning and also added corn with the beans. My boyfriend was skeptical about white chili, but this recipe is definitely a keeper!! I will be making this again for sure!"
5.0,Absolutely amazing!! Will make again and again. I will use one can of chilies this time instead though as we are feeding a few kiddos :)
5.0,I loved this !!!! Very tasty
5.0,This was delicious. I used only one can of chilis and used half and half instead of heavy cream. It was a hit in my family. Yum!
5.0,My very first time making bread and it came out great! I honestly don’t think I’m ever gonna buy store bought white bread again. It’s super easy and cheap to make. Mine was a little on the dense and salty side so maybe I’ll use a tad bit less salt but it’s still sooo good.
5.0,"Literally the only thing I’ve baked, looked kinda weird and I forgot the canola oil but it was still yummy. Good recipe for a valiant first attempt. Hopefully I’ll remember the oil next time"
5.0,"Delicious!  I am extremely impressed, it turned out great and it was my first time ever baking experiment! Has anyone tried putting seeds in it? Just wondering if that would work.  On another note I suggest using olive oil instead of canola, it gives the perfect kick!"
5.0,Thanks for this!  Looks so easy and delicious i will try to do this one!??
5.0,"stupid easy to make! I forgot to grease the top of the bread, but that didn&#39;t seem to affect it much. also, for those curious, you can definitely replace canola oil with olive oil, and regular sugar with brown sugar, or truvia brown sugar blend if that&#39;s all you have. if using truvia blend, make sure to follow the sugar to truvia conversion in the back of the bag.! thanks so much for this awesome recipe, will try making these on a weekly basis and see if i can save money on store bought bread!"
5.0,"I&#39;ve made this several times. I added, sausage,  cheeses, garlic, onion, and herbs. And it is absolutly amazing! Try it, you will love it. Thanks for the recipe"
5.0,My favorite home made bread ever!  Easy to make and Lovely warm with butter. I use the 3 tbsp sugar as stated in the ingredients list and not the 1/2 cup it says in the directions though. That bit was confusing at first lol. I just follow the ingredients list and proofed the yeast then added the other ingredients to that  in my stand mixer adding the flour a half cup at a time till the last half cup. Then I just kind of throw pinches at it till it looks right Haha!!  Beautiful bread! Thank you :)
5.0,Another amazing bread recipe. They came out perfect!
5.0,Love this bread! I&#39;m making it for a second time due to the fact my family can&#39;t get enough! I don&#39;t mind because it&#39;s super simple to make and comes out perfect every time!
5.0,I have made it several times now. It’s perfect. Thank you.
5.0,"I have been making this bread every Sunday for about a year now. It’s a fantastic sandwich bread. I make 2 loaves every Sunday for sandwiches for the week. I brush some butter on the tops of them as soon as they’re out, let them cool for a couple hours then slice them and stick them in the freezer ready for sandwiches :)"
5.0,"I followed exactly what the recipe says and this bread turns out perfect every single time!! I had never made any kind of homemade bread before, and this was so easy. It does take some time simply because how long it takes the dough to rise, but the amount of time actually making and working with the dough is not long at all. My family loves this bread, and I have actually had some people purchase loaves off of me as well. I was even told that it is better than bread from Amish Country!!! Thanks so much for this recipe! I will definitely recommend it to anyone that wants to make their own bread!!!"
5.0,"Great recipe, best bread I’ve made so far - turned out exactly as you’d hope and has risen perfectly. Topped mine with shallots and grated cheese before baking for a bit of added flavour. Definitely recommend you try this one!"
5.0,"I&#39;ve gone through many recipe&#39;s trying to find one that was simple, good texture and taste great.  My search is over this is the one I&#39;ve been looking for."
5.0,Omg! I&#39;ve always sucked at bread UNTIL this recipe! Awesome it came out great. My daughter kept asking for more!
5.0,"Made this bread for the first time for Easter. Nice workout kneading the bread for sure. I did use a little over two tablespoons of sugar and two teaspoons of salt based on other reviews, and used an egg wash. We had a couple of slices with bolognese for dinner and even the end slice was tasty!  This is a great recipe that I will make again. Need to just have the time to let it rise."
5.0,"Question, could I substitute self rising flour for the AP? THANKS!"
5.0,Just came out very nice.my everyday breakfast is now changed to bread.thank you very very very very very much.wish you the best
5.0,"Oh. My. God.  This non-baker made this bread today and it is fantastic.  I used a little less than 6 cups of flour, followed the directions to the &#34;t&#34; and shaped them into round loaves, because why would I have 2 loaf pans???!  I greased 2 9x9 cake pans with bacon fat shortning and smeared them with a little of it before I popped them on the oven.  Thirty minutes later with a ten minute cool down and boy is this bread yummy.  Super delicious and not real heavy.  Great recipe!  Thank You TOH!"
5.0,I made this as is for a gathering and it was a huge hit. Even the little ones wanted seconds!
5.0,Made this last month.  It was a big hit.  Everyone was fighting for the leftovers.
5.0,I love this recipe.  I have  made it several times and it is a favorite.  I usually use 3 cans of beans.  I like more beans in my chilie.  This is spicey so make sure to have bread handy.  Excellent.
5.0,Its so good. Its great over rice!!
5.0,this is great! I will make this several more times for sure!
5.0,"This is the same recipe my father always made for me. Although, he always used just 1 4oz can of green chilies... but the people in my house weren&#39;t very good with hot food. 8oz gives enough heat that you can feel it, but it&#39;s not too overwhelming. Friends and family always love it!"
5.0,"A winner with everyone at my house.  Easy to make, nice bite without burning on the way down."
5.0,Excellent!! This one&#39;s a keeper for sure.
5.0,I got this recipe from taste of home years ago and everyone loves it there are never any leftovers. We like it with tortilla chips instead of crackers or bread. Have shared it with church because everyone wants this recipe.
5.0,My husband says this is the best chili he&#39;s ever had.  It is delicious!  This recipe is definatey a keeper.
5.0,Outstanding!  I made this and took the leftovers to work...everyone asked for the recipe and a couple of people went home and made it that night!  I did make a couple of small changes.  I used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder and because I didn&#39;t have any heavy cream I substituted a couple of tablespoons of cream cheese.  This was soooooo good!  Can&#39;t wait to make it again.  Thank you for this recipe.
5.0,"WOW - used fresh garlic, added 2 tlb fresh cilantro, and  rotisserie chicken (rather than cooking my own).  Made day in advance - so it sat in the fridge one day - wow, was awesome and SOOOOO easy..Thanks a million"
5.0,Phenomenal!!!! I&#39;m not normally a huge chili fan. This is definitely going on my favorites list! :D
5.0,"This is an excellent recipe...Its so easy and so good. I halved both loaves (after the first halves) to make twists, then egg washed and sesame seeds. Beautiful loaves."
5.0,"FULL DISCLOSURE: Not the best bread recipie I&#39;ve came across in  some 40 years of baking bread by hand, but it does get 5 stars because it&#39;s so easy and reliable.I use bulk Flour, Sugar, and even Yeast. No need tp buy premium ingredients here.TIPS: &#34;Proof&#34; the yeast water and Sugar for at least 10 minutes.Make SURE the water isn&#39;t over 115 degreesDo NOT over rise or over bake.It works fone for me!"
5.0,"Easy to follow, turned out really good, my family loved it. I did bake both loafs together and baked it for 40 minutes instead of  35, I have convection oven. Otherwise, perfect."
5.0,"I baked this bread earlier today, and it was so easy. It turned out great and is very delicious! My 2 year old loved it."
5.0,Yummy ;)
5.0,"First time making bread was a week or so ago. I decided the best thing to do was keep it simple.. and this bread turned out amazing. My GF was pretty impressed to see that I had made bread too. Here I am again a week later, making it again !! &lt;3"
5.0,"Omg the best! I used this recipe for the first time last night. The bread came out PERFECT! So moist and delicious, my daughter couldn&#39;t get enough. I used a glass loaf dish and followed the directions step by step. Will definitely use this recipe again"
5.0,"This recipe is the best! I don’t bake ever, and I consider myself a complete novice in the kitchen, and I just made this for the first time and I had to eat half a loaf it was so good. I threw in a couple handfuls of dried cranberries, OMG,  make this if you want to impress people. Too bad I only have my dog to impress LOL, she had a slice"
5.0,"Have been baking bread for over 50 years, this recipe, by far has the best taste, texture and easiest recipe I have tried!  Thank you for sharing Sandra!  Today was my second time using this recipe, I know I will be using it very often!"
5.0,This was my very first time making bread and it turned out perfect! I really love the ease of this recipe! I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to make bread!
5.0,"This is a delicious bread recipe. If you own a KitchenAid stand mixer, use the dough kneading attachment and set the timer for 8-9 minutes instead of doing it by hand, unless you want a workout."
5.0,"If you are looking for bread your grandma made you fond it.  I believe make great rolls cinnamon rolls . I used my stand mixer to make the dough , I have been making bread for some time this is the best I have found .Be sure to let your bread cool down you my not be able to cut it until next day .  I don&#39;t how old my yeast is it came from a food bank in a bag we put in a pizza jar and keep it in the relegate ."
5.0,Thank you!!! Thank you....my bread came out great. I even had extra dough to make cinnamon bread. This is my go to bread. No more store brought bread.
5.0,"Simple and absolutely amazing! I have baked bread homemade and from scratch all my life as I am a Jewish woman. This recipe is easy and simple but gives you the finest of bakeries taste, bakeries that I’d rate outstanding at 5 stars. Incredible and an absolute must try!"

5.0,"My husband and I love this bread! It doesn&#39;t take me all day to make, which is a big plus, and it tastes great! I have it for breakfast, make my husbands lunch with it and serve it at dinner when we want bread. I don&#39;t use quite so much sugar or salt and the results are still great."
5.0,"This is any easy bread recipe to make. I cut my the next day and it sliced pretty easily, not breaking all apart."
5.0,"This is THE best, and easiest bread recipe. I made a few adjustments but the foundation recipe for ingredients, measures and prep/cooking were straight from this recipe. [(I used bread flour instead of AP flour, olive oil on place of the canola (that&#39;s what I had on hand), and threw in some savory spices to give it a kick and it rose up better than any recipe I&#39;d ever used, plus I put a dash of olive oil in the dough because I read that bread flour dough can be dry.]"
5.0,Love this bread. I make it at lease twice a month. Comes out perfect every time.
5.0,"I love this recipe, although one time I made the mistake of adding jalapenos (cans were virtually identical) instead of the chilies which made it way too hot for my taste, but the rest of the group loves spicy food so it ended up working out! I have made it several times since then and everyone loves it!"
5.0,"My daughter first made this recipe and it since has become a favorite of everyone! I make mine with boneless, skinless chicken thighs that my husband smokes with hickory...it makes this chili beyond incredible!!"
5.0,This chili is delicious and very easy to make!  The sour cream at the end tames the bite of the chili but doesn&#39;t overpower the complementary flavors.  Serve this with a nice hunk of baguette for a tasty lunch!
5.0,Easy and the kids loved it!! One of my favorites!
5.0,Best while chicken chili I&#39;ve ever had. Super delicious.
5.0,amazing!
5.0,This is a favorite of my husband &amp; mine.  I add frozen corn to it. It&#39;s delicious with corn bread as a side.
5.0,"I use 3 cans of beans, and 3 cans of green chili&#39;s for thicker chili. I cant even count how many times Ive cooked this. It never gets old."
5.0,"This recipe was delicious and will be made again. This recipe turned out a little soupier than the picture so next time I plan on adding 2 additional cans of northern beans. One can of beans, pureed, to help thicken the chili without adding additional fat and the other can just to add more &#39;stuff&#39; into the chili. Even though I will change a few things for my personal taste... this was delicious just &#39;as is&#39;."
5.0,"My family LOVED this! With every bite they would &#34;mmmm&#34; and say &#34;this is so good, you have to make this again!&#34;"
5.0,Very tasty!! Flavors were awesome! I agree with several of the reviews of it being too soupy. Next time I&#39;ll take the advice of several and add another can of beans. I&#39;ll definitely make this again. Thanks for a great recipe!
5.0,What a delicious alternative to regular chili!  I had a sample before adding the creams and enjoyed it just as much as the finished product.
5.0,One of our family favorites.  Super easy to make and tastes wonderful. I sub. ground chicken for the breasts and it makes it even easier &amp; more chili like.
5.0,My family loves this recipe. I use it to make rolls! Perfect crusty but soft bread. Love it!
5.0,This is my go to recipe I am a novice bread baker and was a bit nervous if this recipe would work out. I am glad I did it&#39;s a hit every time the only thing I would like to share is the first time the bread lost moisture and so was a bit hard but then a friend told me to put a tray with water on the bottom rack to create a steam oven I am glad I got this tip the bread comes out moist on the inside and crusty on the outside!
5.0,I have never baked anything before..  the homemade bread recipe was excellent and easy. Thank you
5.0,"I am not experienced with yeast breads at all.  This is the second one I&#39;ve made.  I followed the recipe exactly and was rewarded with two beautiful and delicious loaves of bread.  The crust came out just right crispness and the texture on the inside is delightful, soft, delicious.  I am so proud of how they turned out!  Easy to follow directions, will definitely use this recipe again.Edit:  My family tried it later in the day and all 4 of them lost their mind over the deliciousness, and I received specific compliments on crust and texture.  This bread is really a hit!"
5.0,First time I made bread.  Was very easy and came out perfectly. Thank you!
5.0,"This recipe is awesome! I made it just like the recipe stated. It was perfect. I will be making more today. My whole family loved it. For people who can&#39;t get the bread to rise, try putting it in front of a small heater. It helped mine rise a lot."
5.0,I used this recipe when I decided to start making bread again ~ perfect!  I preheat the oven to 200 degrees then shut it off as I&#39;m kneading and the dough rises perfectly!  My husband is always happy when I&#39;m making this and prefers it to store bought bread!
5.0,I made this bread tonight.It turned out great!! I did take advice of a previous review and raised my dough in an oven preheated to 200. You turn the oven off before putting your dough in. I Love this simple yummy bread recipe!
5.0,"I just made this bread and it turned out marvelous! However, I feel like it has some important steps left out that you need to know if you&#39;re not an experienced bread Baker. First of all - to activate your yeast - you need to put the warm water and yeast and sugar alone in your bowl. Stir it well, cover it, and set it aside when it&#39;s frothy looking - those foamy looking bubbles mean the yeast is ready to go. THEN add all the other ingredients. Otherwise it&#39;s a great basic recipe. Make sure to work the dough long enough - I do half with a dough hook and my KitchenAid and half by hand on a flour dusted counter. It needs to feel really smooth and stretchy. Good luck! It tastes delicious and a perfect texture!"
5.0,Turned out great :-)
5.0,"First time baking bread and this recipe was so easy to follow and bread came out delicious.  Crust was just right, perfect height and density.  I used 6 1/4 cups of King Arthur&#39;s Unbleached Bread Flour and added a touch of honey.  I will be making my own bread and rolls from now on using this basic recipe."
5.0,"I tried this recipe once and it was terrible. The second time I used 1/4 cup water and 1 tablespoon sugar. Dissolved the sugar and then added the yeast. Cover the yeast and let it set for 10 minutes until frothy. After that I added the rest of the ingredients and kneeded the living carp out of it. Everything turned out perfect this time. Light, fluffy, and yeasty. It was delicious. Just active the yeast in this way and it will turn out fine."
5.0,"I created an account just to rate this excellent recipe, which I followed exactly as written. I know some people have commented that it&#39;s important to activate the yeast, but I didn&#39;t do that. I just did what the recipe said and it worked out fine. I also used regular old all-purpose flour (some have said it&#39;s important to use some kind of special bread flour), and it was perfect: light, fluffy, with a crust that wasn&#39;t too hard--exactly what I wanted. I&#39;m not sure what happened with the folks who called this recipe &#34;terrible&#34; and said they ended up with bread that was inedible. All I can say is their experience is nothing like mine.Highly recommended!"
5.0,"Making this recipe for the second time this week! It&#39;s easy and delicious. I mix the yeast, water and sugar in the bowl first, wait ten minutes and then add in the salt, flour and oil. I use a blend of bread flour, whole wheat and ground flax seed. It makes loaves that are light and not too crusty."
5.0,The best bread recipe that I have ever used.  Beautiful and very delish.  My now go to bread recipe!!
5.0,Great easy recipe and a first time bread maker like me can make.    Great tasting bread and so easy to make
5.0,I&#39;ve been making this bread for the last 6 years and my family LOVES it!  This bread is easy to make and tastes wonderful too.  This bread is a staple in our home!
5.0,"OMG first time I ever baked bread, this recipe is the best. first time And easy to follow   Instructions  will make it more of it.  And tasty nice and fluffy"
5.0,"Didn&#39;t think I would get it right, but somehow I did. Then I started doing twice the recipe and ended up with substituting some flour with wheat bran and try different shapes. I ended up with baguettes, subs, bread and buns. All in one cooking session. Even tried some maple &amp; cinnamon bread which ended up great!"
5.0,Delicious!!! This is a new favorite!  The only things I added were 2 cans of black beans and half a bottle of beer.  Great recipie! Thank you!
5.0,We make this recipe several times a year. A family favorite.
5.0,"When cooking for others, this dish is one of the most requested. I like to use ground turkey instead of chicken breasts... it&#39;s cheaper and I like the texture a little bit better. My husband isn&#39;t a fan of chili, but he loves this!"
5.0,Excellent. Will make often
5.0,"Awesome! Every time I make this, someone asks me for the recipe.  You can always play with the heat level by adding jalapeno."
5.0,This was delicious and super easy to prepare. I added fresh garlic and hot sauce and used light whipping cream. I also seasoned the chicken with a blend of poultry spice. This was so yummy! I was proud to serve it and will absolutely make it again!
5.0,I make this recipe at least a half dozen times each year. To make it faster I buy a rotisserie chicken from the deli and add dried onions instead of fresh. Dinner can be ready in minutes and my entire family loves it!
5.0,This  is my first time making chicken chili.This just looked good so I tried it and it was really good.I used a whole chicken and made my homemade broth.Kicked it up with habanero pepper and smoked salt.I will make this again and again.
5.0,I got this recipe years ago in a taste of home magazine.  I have made it so many times my little recipe card is getting worn out!!  It is incredibly yummy and so easy to make!!
5.0,Our favorite recipe! Instead of chicken I use browned ground turkey. Excellent!
5.0,One of my absolute favorite recipes!!
5.0,I have been making this recipe for a couple of years now. It is extremely popular with family &amp; friends. We like to serve with buffalo wing sauce for an extra kick.
5.0,"I&#39;ve made this too many times to count...but instead of using the chicken breast, I use smoked boneless chicken thighs (hubby cooks them). I modify the seasonings to suit our tastes. Today I used smoked cumin, alot of ancho chili pepper and ample cayenne. I use half-n-half instead of heavy cream, and light sour cream. Did I mention to add alot of garlic? This chili is always amazing!! It&#39;s a family fave!"
5.0,My family and i are absolutely in love with this recipe. I only halved the recipe and came out best. It&#39;s the bomb.  This is my go to bread recipe  from now on
5.0,Could this recipe be doubled ?
5.0,"AWESOME, easy bread recipe! Loaf just came fresh out of the oven. ...yum! Perfect ingredient portions. Even works with Himalayan Pink Salt for regular salt &amp; Pure Cane Sugar instead of regular.  When I divided the dough in half; made that one loaf and divided the other half in two, put them in refrigerator for future use. Thanks for sharing!"
5.0,"Simply outstanding.  I&#39;ve made this recipe more than once -- several times at high elevation in Denver, another time at/near sea level in Houston.  I never leave reviews for recipes, but felt the need to pay it forward on this one.  PRO TIP (based on experience and experimentation): use UNBLEACHED bread flour if you want a softer crust.  I&#39;ve used standard, all-purpose bleached flour, but the crust ends up too hard.  It&#39;s almost too difficult to cut through it in the end.  I much prefer the softer crust.  As for the rest of the recipe, follow it.  It&#39;s perfect.  I mix it all by hand using a mixing bowl and, literally, a regular fork.  Yes, my arm begins to ache by the time I&#39;ve added the 4th cup of flour.  Also, if you are a bread-baking newbie like I was, I used advice found online to determine if my bread had risen enough on both the 1st and 2nd rise. "
5.0,"I actually signed up on here to leave a review. I NEVER leave reviews for recipes I&#39;ve tried. But I made this bread and this was the first time I got bread RIGHT! The dough was stiff yet workable, it raised well and I actually got 4 loaves instead of just the 2! It tasted delicious and this is the recipe I&#39;d pass down to my generation of family! It&#39;s THAT amazing!"
5.0,"I&#39;ve made this bread several times already! The first time was good, and has only gotten better each time! I concur with Ryan below about using bread flour (I used King Arthur), but I use my wife&#39;s beloved Kitchenaid stand mixer which more than meets and exceeds the challenge of kneading. I also divide the dough into thirds (and can even go for four small loaves), and it does keep for a few days, IF it lasts that long! :-D The final bread product, when made with bread flour, is a good crumb, nice chew and wonderfully crispy, yet soft, crust.A WONDERFUL beginner&#39;s recipe! I&#39;ll experiment with adding herbs and other flavors to this dough!"
5.0,Was super easy to make and turned out well! The directions were simple and easy to follow.
5.0,"Love this simple recipe This is my 1st time baking white bread at home. I have baked spelt flour recipes a couple of times and came out good. Love the taste, Instead of adding only all purpose flour I added 3-1/2 cups all purpose and the rest spelt flour, also added a tblspoon of flax seed powder. I have never loved white bread like this before. Next time I will definitely use all ... all purpose flour :). I am a beginner in bread baking, this recipe really made me confident abt my bread baking skills. Thank you."
5.0,Worked out great
5.0,"I have made this twice and after the first rise don&#39;t knead the dough. It makes it VERY dense. On my second bake It was half as dense, but it was still dense. If you don&#39;t knead it enough before the first rise the glutton won&#39;t build    enough to become light and fluffy."
5.0,"Awesome awesome awesome bread. So good as a sandwich, killer as mop up bread with gravy. Even better with garlic seasoning and butter lightly toasted! I have made this bread six times now and everyone loves it, thanks so much."
5.0,"I love this recipe, and so does everyone whose tasted it. I had to start dividing the dough into three portions and put the loaves into smaller pans since my family nearly inhales it every time I make it. I don&#39;t even need to adjust the baking time, they turn out beautifully every time. As for the amount of flour, I think the recipe is only showing you what you will need before you start, like say you only need 5 cups of flour for the bread, what happens if you only have that much flour? You can&#39;t knead the bread so well cuz you ran out, I tested how much I end up using after my dough is ready to be kneaded, and I use almost another whole cup of flour."
5.0,I just made this amazing bread and it tastes great!  I only needed 5.5 cups of flour and it still came out quite dense.  I baked in the oven one level up from the bottom with a cookie sheet on the bottom level.  This keeps the bottom from getting too burnt.It came out looking exactly like the picture.  My kids love it too!  This is great cause I hate breadmakers since the belt eventually slips on them and they make more noise.  Now I can make bread with no preservatives!
5.0,I had never made bread before trying this recipe. It is so good! I&#39;m now making loaves for my neighbors for Christmas!  I also added cheese and jarred jalape?os and was worried that it would mess up with not changing any of the other measurements -turned out delicious! turned out delicious   Thank you for this recipe !
5.0,I used this recipe to make my first bread in the oven (I&#39;ve used a bread machine before). Easy to make and tastes great. I used 5-3/4 cups of flour.
5.0,"This is essentially the Betty Crocker White Bread recipe from the 1950 cookbook, which I no longer have :( So I was happy to find a similar recipe!  The only difference I can see is the Betty Crocker recipe called for shortening or lard rather than canola oil. I compromised and used butter LOL :) Also, if I&#39;m not mistaken, the Betty Crocker recipe says to bake at 425, not 375. I&#39;m going to give this 375 a go this time and stick to the recipe as written. Other than the butter, that is...because it looks like it&#39;s a winner as written!I just want to say I&#39;m a touch annoyed by reviewers who leave one star, then go on to explain how they changed this and that and had bad results and won&#39;t make the recipe again. How about actually following the recipe, and if you don&#39;t, it&#39;s a little unfair to one-star the posted recipe when it&#39;s your changes that probably really failed. Just a thought ;)And yes, one tablespoon of salt is the correct amount."
5.0,First time &#34;bread maker&#34;  from scratch.  OMG - this is as good as .... chocolate!  A MUST REPEAT recipe.   Simply outstanding!
5.0,"My family and I Love this recipe for bread .. 1st try and success. For starters, start here.  I watched a youtube before attempting to get the process down."
5.0,"ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! I have been searching for an easy picture perfect yeast bread recipe for 50 years. The first recipe I tried I threw away the loaf. This is fool proof. AND YES I DID MODIFY, used only 5 cups flour then extra for dusting, only used 2 tsp of salt. If I could add a picture I would. I drove in a thunderstorm to take slices to neighbor because I needed a witness as how wonderful it was ! A man would marry you in a heartbeat if you served this.LOL"
5.0,"I accidentally doubled the amount of sugar, salt and oil (I tried to cut the recipe in half... mistakes were made), but the bread still came out looking and tasting amazing! I imagine my accidental adjustments just made for a more flavorful loaf, which is nothing I&#39;m complaining about. I would definitely make this again."
5.0,It was delicious and easy to make. I would recommend putting an egg wash or butter over the loaf before cooking to make it look better though.
5.0,Simply delicious. My husband loved it too.
5.0,"I have never been able to bake bread.  It was always a waste! I am loving this recipe.  I could tell by the dough that it would be good but it WA really great.  After the 3 cups of flour, I did what the recipe advised and added the extra flour 1/2 cup at a time and 51/2 cups did the trick ( plus extra for kneading). I made a nice round loaf, a regular sized loaf and 6 cinnamon rolls that I made by adding a mixture of sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, butter and a bit of flour and vanilla and heaping it on top of the rolls before baking.  Everything tasted delicious. I&#39;m hooked! Will be baking this bread alot! Thank you!"
5.0,"I had no idea what I was doing making bread on my own for the first time! This recipe is so easy for the beginner, and the only problem I had with the bread was how quickly my family scarfed it down! Thank you so much!"
5.0,"This was perfectly simple and delicious! I made it just as written. I started with 5 cups of flour, but easily made it to 6.5 cups while kneading the dough. I only have one bread pan, so I put half of the dough in a loaf pan and made the rest as a round loaf in a casserole dish. Both turned out great. I&#39;m sure we will be making this again soon!"
5.0,guys this recipe worked my family loved it so from now on we prefer making our own bread at home save money and way delicious yes guys thanks to the owner GOD BLESS
5.0,Loved it! I&#39;ve never made bread before and this was so much easier than I thought it would be. Great by itself or for sandwiches.
5.0,"this bread is the most consistently fantastic bread i have ever made-and i make a lot of bread, i love the attention i get for this wonderful bread! I don&#39;t  deserve the fuss really because it is dead easy to make ha ha :)"
5.0,"This recipe is awesome! I have never made bread before and was so worried that I&#39;d be terrible at it because my mom never got the hang of it. The only thing I did differently is I used instant yeast instead of the active dry, because when I bought yeast before finding this recipe I didn&#39;t know which to buy. Other than that I followed the recipe to a T. The bread came out perfect. I can&#39;t believe I made perfect bread on my first try! And it&#39;s really yummy. I&#39;ll be using this recipe from now on and I&#39;ll be making a lot more bread from here on out!"
5.0,Works great. Though I only need 5 1/2 cups of flour or it becomes too dense
5.0,"This is by far the most simplistic bread recipe I&#39;ve ever come across. I&#39;ve tried so many bread recipes but I could never memorize them because of so many steps involved and the bread never came out exactly as the recipe&#39;s image or as it should. This recipe came out perfect, my kids and husband loved it and I was able to memorize the steps so I can put my spin on it. Today I made it for the second time with 3 cups white flour and 3 cups wheat. Peerfect! It&#39;s a keeper!!"
5.0,"Oh. My. Jesus!!! Such a simple and perfect recipe!!! The bread is awesome. Soft on the inside, a bit of crunch on the outside... mmmh mmmh mmmh!!! I made mine with a little less flour too (About 5 cups), and added raisins. Thank you so much for posting this :)"
5.0,I have tried my entire life to make bread like this and I felt like Queen for a day when I actually succeeded! Your recipe made learning it fun! Thanks for making a recipe that finally made me a success!!!!
5.0,Great recipe. I like it better with 1.5-2 tsp of salt. I also added some chopped jalapeno and cheddar cheese to one loaf. It was great!
5.0,"Absolutely love this recipe!  I have made it several times now.  My husband and I have stopped buying bread and only eat what I make :)Linda that posted Nov 15, 2016...The olive oil will make it salty and taste a little weird.  I would recommend using either canola or vegetable oil (corn oil may also work, but haven&#39;t tried it).  As long as you use the right type of oil one tablespoon of salt is perfect.  I also like to grease the bowl and pans with Un salted butter. It adds a nice slight butter taste."
5.0,"This is exactly the same as the recipe I use in my bread machine, just use half the ingredients and add an egg. Heaven. One trick I do that really makes a huge difference is to spray surface with Pam instead of dusting with four. Also spray your hands, butter would work just as well"
5.0,"Love this recipe, the bread was delicious. We doubled the recipe and used extra virgin olive oil instead of canola oil, it came out perfect, I just decreased the salt as olive oil has a stronger taste as canola!"
5.0,"PERFECT!!!I&#39;ve tried 2 other &#34;easy&#34; recipes over the last 2 days and BOTH went in the trash! I finally found this recipe,  and while reluctant, because of the last 2 failures,  I decided to give this one a try. I am sooooo glad I did! Not only are the ingredients simple, but so is putting it together and making it.I did make a few minor modifications based on some of the reviews. I used 5 1/4 cups of flour instead of the 6 1/4 to 6 3/4 cups it calls for. I found that the recommended amount of flour was just entirely too much. I also used vegetable oil instead of canola, because that&#39;s all I had.This bread is wonderful! My husband, son and mother ate a whole loaf in  two hours! The other loaf is almost gone today.It is so moist and soft. I can&#39;t believe it turned out this good! I made everyone french toast this morning and grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch. We will no longer spend $3 for a loaf of store bought bread. I&#39;ve finally found my tried and trusted recipe right here!Good luck everyone! Enjoy this awesome recipe. Your family will thank you for it! :)P.S. This site should allow us to post pictures, to prove how our recipes turned out."
5.0,"I&#39;m rating simply for the other reviews. I&#39;ll try this next week. As for answering the questions from cdj516 - whether the dough can be halved _ yes I can&#39;t see any issues. As for freezing the dough - can&#39;t say for sure. I don&#39;t usually freeze bread dough. What I do is bake the whole recipe, cool to room temp and divide each loaf into three. For us that is the perfect size for a day or two. I wrap the sections individually in plastic wrap, then place into a freezer bag. I grab out of the freezer as I need it. Thawing isn&#39;t an issue... takes 10 minutes or so."
5.0,Is there a bread machine version of the classic white bread?
5.0,"I&#39;ve tweaked this a little to make it better (for me atleast ) I use 3 teas yeast ,only rise once ,it makes it a lot less dense ,I also changed the temp around some(lower like 10 degrees) ,and it seems to make it even softer ,but still same time"
5.0,Tried this recipe for the first time and I was very pleased with the results. I can&#39;t offer any suggestions for improvements. Very simple recipe. If you follow directions precisely you will get some really great bread. Hope it stays fresh for a couple days. Definitely worth making again!
5.0,"Great recipe.  I used half whole wheat and half white flour.  I also used olive oil instead of the canola oil called for.  This recipe calls for one tablespoon of salt. I thought that was too much, so I used less.  I should have added the full tablespoon the recipe called for. The bread was still very good, but when I make this again, and I will add one tablespoon of salt.  Thanks for the great bread recipe."
5.0,Followed the recipe as it is works fine tnx
5.0,"Great bread, easy recipe, and it rose really well with a crusty outside and fluffy inside. I made a loaf and some buns for burgers with the dough and they were perfect. I read a couple reviews about the flour total being wrong, the recipe does ask for 6 -63/4 cups in total and I added that much and it was fine. It asks for three cups first and then additional flour after as much as needed. Followed the recipe as is and it turned out as I would have hoped. I will make this again and pass it on."
5.0,"Currently enjoying this toasted with jam and a nice cup of coffee. Great recipe! I found the sugar unnecessary so eliminated that and it tastes just as good. Also decided to just wing it on the flour-- add it until the dough was ready, no more no less, and that worked better than the first batch.I&#39;ve never baked bread before and this was the perfect beginner&#39;s recipe! So excited to try new twists on it as well."
5.0,Easy &amp; simple recipe to follow.   Delicious every time!!
5.0,"I double this recipe and bake 4 loaves at a time because my family &amp; I love this bread so much!  It is a delicious recipe!  Garlic cheese toast, open pb &amp; j sandwiches, and good Ole buttered toast are just a few of our favorite ways to eat it!  My daughter just eats it plain and untoasted she likes it so much!"
5.0,Thanks a lot for the easy to follow  recipe and videos. I&#39;m a beginner bread maker and your video&#39;s really help me.  Thanks again from NZ
5.0,"My go-to recipe for basic white bread.  Easy and turns out well every time. For a soft crust, brush with a little butter when you take it out of the oven."
5.0,This recipe was so easy and my family loved it.  I have a question about making mini loaves.  What would be the cook time?
5.0,Tried this recipe today. super easy and my loaves came out really well..lovely super soft texture..Thanks a bunch for the recipe !!
5.0,"I made this bread today and followed the recipe pretty close including the rising times, except for a  couple ingredients. I changed out 1 1/2 cups of the flour for whole wheat flour and used instant dry yeast 2 1/4 tsp (= 1 pkg yeast)  plus I added a little more yeast (about 1/2 tsp) because of the whole wheat flour.  I also sifted all the flour after measuring. It raised beautifully and turned out very good. It&#39;s going to be my go to recipe for bread.  Enjoying every slice!"
5.0,"I have made this bread several times over the past month and this is what I can tell you.  (1) the first time I made it, I used all purpose flour, as the recipe called for.  The bread came out really good.  (2) the second time I made it, I used bread flour.  The bread came out really good.  In both, the texture was good, but just  a bit different from each other.  Then came (3) and this time, I used a combination of 1/2 all purpose and 1/2 bread flour.  Results?  Perfect phenomenal bread.  This had a great texture and taste and this will be the way I make it from now on.Ok, now, I like a few others, have found that 5 cups of flour proves to be enough flour.When I made bread tonight, I made 2 small loaves and a pan of cinnamon rolls.  My husband and grandson loved them.   They said the taste and texture were perfect."
5.0,"I have a son who doesn&#39;t like eggs, butter and milk, so I went looking for a bread recipe that don&#39;t have eggs, butter or milk. The bread that i usually make has butter and milk. I tried this recipe and had great success, I have added it as my standard bread recipe. Thanks to Sandra Anderson for submitting the recipe and to taste of home for publishing it."
5.0,"I followed the suggestion of using half all purpose flour and half bread flour.  I also needed 6 full cups of flour.  I made one loaf of bread and rolled the other half out into twelve cinnamon rolls.  My dough raised beautifully.  I have a proofing setting on my oven, and let the loaf rise for 40 minutes, which is about how much it took me to make the cinnamon rolls. Cinnamon rolls took about an hour to rise.  Turned out great - very easy dough to work with, and this bread will go into my recipe rotation."
5.0,"I have made this bread twice with bleached flour and whole wheat  flour, both turned out perfect and taste great. Easy recipe for a beginner bread maker. Thanx for the recipe"
5.0,"Really simple, quick and tasty bread. I used 5 cups of  ultragrain white flour and found it to be the perfect texture with great rise  - as long as my kitchen was decently warm. I let the loaves rise beside my crock pot while it was cooking some soup on low and that seemed to do the trick. The taste was really lovely, just a hint of sweet and not too yeasty, with a nice crumb and golden crispy crust. Will be making this bread often!"
5.0,Great basic bread and just what I was looking for. I substituted olive oil for canola oil and didn&#39;t notice a difference. I also turned one loaf into focaccia bread. I put half the dough in an oiled 13 x 9 lasagna pan and sprinkled the top with minced fresh garlic and sliced olives. I let it rise the second time and baked it alongside the regular loaf. 10 minutes before it was done I sprinkled shredded cheese over the top. Very tasty.Also used two tbsp sugar instead of three with no problem.
5.0,"I would like to make this bread but with less sugar,  would that be possible?"
5.0,I made this recipe today and used 1/2 all purpose flour and 1/2 whole wheat.  The loaves turned out golden brown on the outside and a lovely light brown on the inside.  The bread was delicious.  The recipe was easy to follow and I will be using it again.  Thanks for posting!
5.0,The BEST recipe for homemade white bread I&#39;ve ever tried.  It is moist and delicious with a hint of sweetness.   It is perfect!   My only regret is the fact that I LOVE it ... Hence I eat it ~ waaaay too much.  :)
5.0,"My whole family loves this bread and begs me to make more.  We have significantly cut out store bought bread and instead make this.  We have also used it as pizza crust and that was great too.  We made two pizzas out of one batch of dough, but found the dough too thick - a half recipe/batch could make two pizzas (or whole recipe for one loaf of bread &amp; two pizza crusts).  Plan to try to add in whole wheat flour soon."
5.0,I like to substitute honey for the sugar. Turns out great!
5.0,Great recipe for bread! Definitely nostalgic of when my mother used to bake it for us. This recipe is enough for two loaves :)
5.0,"Excellent recipe!  For those asking about flour weight, 142 grams = 1cup and 5oz = 1 cup.  I measure my flour on a scale for anything I make from scratch.  It makes all the difference."
5.0,"I am rating this based on looking for so long for a easy basic bread recipe. This is exactly the  &#34;basic&#34; bread recipe I have been looking for!!! I have not made it yet but will very soon, I am however concerned about how much bread it will make, I have a small household so I am reaching out for advice: has anyone tried to make only half of the recipe and also can this dough be frozen if I make the full amount and only bake one loaf of bread. I love the other idea&#39;s of what I can make with it. Your suggestions are great."
5.0,"Loved this chili! Made a few alterations taking a cue from other reviews, added a can of navy beans, chopped crimini mushrooms, a jalepeno and a bit extra cayenne pepper. Will make again, great recipe!"
5.0,This soup is so good.  I added 2 diced jalapenos and extra beans and used 1/2 &amp; 1/2.  Will be making this for Christmas Eve dinner with the kids.  YUM!
5.0,Wowwwwww so good! Love it!
5.0,Great recipe!  It was delicious!
5.0,I love love this recipe!
5.0,"Excellent!  The only thing I&#39;d do different next time is use less sour cream.  My picky eater who doesn&#39;t like anything spicy ate this and asked for seconds!  Not spicy, don&#39;t let the cayenne pepper fool you!"
5.0,"Yum, yum, yum! This was absolutely delicious! My husband, who doesn&#39;t usually eat this sort of thing loooves it. I double the recipe and put some in the freezer."
5.0,This recipe is delicious.  I&#39;ve been making this for at least 2 years.   I serve this at bingo quite a few times during the winter. I&#39;ve gotten so many compliments on this.  It&#39;s also a favorite at home.
5.0,FABBBBUUUULLLLOOOUUUUSSSS!  The best non-red chili I have ever had!
5.0,"I made this for my family today and according to my husband and 8 yr old son, this is the best chili ever!  I did, however, make a few changes.  I used smoked turkey breast that my husband made over the holidays instead of the chicken.  I also used  2 fresh garlic cloves (minced) and did not saute the meat, onion and garlic.  I substituted Italian seasoning for the oregano and white pepper for the pepper.  Last of all, I just dumped everything in the crock pot (set on high) for about 3 1/2 hours, adding the sour cream and cream the last half hour.  DELICIOUS!!!!"
5.0,Amazing! My whole family loves this!
5.0,This is the best chicken chili I have ever had.  It is worth the time to make.  I suggest doubling the recipe though if more than 2 people are eating it as it doesn&#39;t make very much.  The next time I make I&#39;m going to try lowfat sour cream and whipping cream to try to cut down on the cals.  Love it!
5.0,"Wonderful flavour, with just a little kick to it. Didn&#39;t have any cumin, so added a 1/2 teaspoon thyme."
5.0,"I added one more small can of chilies, only 1/2 the salt, switched out the whipping cream for FF Half and Half but to keep the thickness I added some dark ale and cornstarch mixture to it. This is a keeper."
5.0,Its not even finished yet n it already smells amazing!!  Ive tried a couple different bread recipes on here and i love them all!
5.0,My whole family loved it! I made two loaves and they were gone in two days!
5.0,Easy to make and substitute whole wheat for white flour.It was delicious.
5.0,This bread was excellent. I&#39;m so excited to have found this easy recipe. I used honey instead of sugar and half whole wheat half all purpose flour delish. Thank you
5.0,"Excellent recipe!! Very easy to follow:)) and super delicious!! Definitely using this recipe again:)), mixed 2 different flour types, worked as a charm!!Thank you!!"
5.0,"I&#39;ve baked bread all my life. This is a very good basic recipe for bread and it spin-offs like cinnamon rolls. Some people I notice complain of the bread not rising either you got your yeast too hot with the water and killed it, or did not take into account rising tempuratures or altitude do just make sure your yeast does not get too hot or cold and you should be fine."
5.0,"This is the recipe my mom used for years for bread and cinnamon rolls. It always came out perfectly. I can&#39;t make it to save my life because I hate making yeast bread. It really does take 8-10 minutes of kneading, I don&#39;t have the patience! The water has to be the correct temperature and the yeast has to be fresh. If your yeast is expired, toss it."
5.0,Use 2 envelopes of dry yeast..   I did  rose great   I make challah  and it uses 4 to 5  cups bread flour   and requires 2 pkts  yeast.
5.0,Excellent tasty bread even my grandson liked it and very easy to make.Going to make more tomorrow!
5.0,"This is a very good basic bread recipe.  If yours didn&#39;t rise, it was because of reasons other than the recipe.  I agree with others who commented earlier that either your water was too hot, yeast too old, or you made a mistake somewhere in your making the bread.  Try again, following the directions."
5.0,"Excellent recipe.  Many years ago a friend told me to buy a candy thermometer and to measure the temperature of the water to mix with yeast, usually 110-115 degrees.  This makes bread making much simpler."
5.0,Use this recipe in my bread machine and it never fails if you follow machine and yeast directions!
5.0,"I found this recipe doing a search for an easy beginners bread recipe.  I love this recipe. It raises for me every time.  I have recently begun to experiment with it by making rolls and cinnamon rolls.  Very simple, very versatile recipe and it will stay in my favorite recipes notebook. I will say to the nay-sayers, get a candy thermometer and check your water temperature. My co-worker told me the easiest way to fail at bread making is to have your water or milk too hot when you add your yeast. Also, check your yeast expiration date."
5.0,"I created an account just leave a review. I am a novice baker (baking for about two weeks now) and my husband has been begging for YEARS for a homemade bread recipe. I finally broke down and Googled &#34;homemade bread recipes&#34; and this was the first one I found. And, WOW. It came out so golden brown and delicious! It rose beautifully and the recipe was so easy to follow! My husband and I promptly devoured half the loaf once I pulled it out of the oven. Oops. I am totally making pb&amp;js with this bread for tomorrow&#39;s outing for me, my husband and our son. Fantastic recipe! Thanks for sharing!"
5.0,"I&#39;ve always had trouble finding the perfect bread recipe,  but I can finally quit looking.  This simple recipe bakes up perfectly and never disappoints!"
5.0,This recipe is very good thank you. Mine didn&#39;t rise well but that was my fault my house was to cool.A question for the person before me Cmolina1. Why on earth would you give a recipe a 1 star because YOU didn&#39;t read the recipe?
5.0,Very simple basic bread recipe. Also good for fry bread. After letting it rise and beating it down simply form into rounds and fry until crispy brown .
5.0,"Excellent and easy bread recipe.  I put water on the top of the bread when it comes out of the oven and wrap it in a towel to steam  This creates a softer crust.  Also, use 1/2 wheat to 1/2 white flour for a wheat bread."
5.0,This is way easy to make! I LOVE IT!
5.0,Best bread i have ever made. Tastes amazing!! My family loves it. So simple to make and very little ingredients.
5.0,Delicious!  I used a heating pad to help the bread rise.
5.0,So good! And easy. I ground up a cup&#39;s worth of steel cut oats and flaxseed in a coffee grinder and added it in place of another cup of flour (trying to eat healthier). It turned out great and nice texture. This bread rose much better than another recipe I used and looks beautiful.
5.0,"Great bread... I just substitute 1 cup of water for 1 cup of milk, and stuffed one with shered mozzarella and the other with cherries.. Yummy yummy.. Thanks for this great recipe"
5.0,Made this today and not only is the recipe super easy it turns out so delicious. A big hit in our house. Thank you for a wonderful bread recipe!
5.0,Thank you for such a marvelously easy bread recipe. Made this a couple of times. I use all whole wheat flour and it makes a bread that tastes pretty much exactly like Outback Steakhouse&#39;s bread. Helps with my diet because I try to cut preservatives and artificial ingredients out.
5.0,super easy  an so delicious
5.0,I love this site. It has awesome receipts that I can make for my family.... Sooooooo happy
5.0,Such an amazing recipe!! Just made it and my mom and dad loved it and so did I!  Very simple... a little lengthy process but totally worth it!
5.0,"Very simple, yet awesome, recipe. Everyone could smell the warm, delicious, bread aroma from outside. We all loved it."
5.0,Love it.
5.0,I use to have issues with my bread rIsing. It was due to the yeast not activating properly..now I have no issues at all...make sire your water temp is close to spot on usualy luke warm will do the trick.
5.0,"great recipe! My bread turned out perfect! I do beat my bread down  twice though to get a more even mix. Also, in the recipe it says 3 cups and on the side of the recipe it says over 6 cups. The  6 cups is the correct one!! If you cant get your bread to rise, it&#39;s because you&#39;re missing over 3 cups of flour!!!"
5.0,"This was the first time I have tried homemade bread and I will never try a different recipe. It made 2 very large loaves and I can&#39;t stop eating them! I only have 1 loaf pan so I decided to just forgo them and put both of my loaves on a non-stick air bake cookie sheet. They came out beautifully. I went about 32 minutes until the internal temp was between 180 and 190.  Immediately after they came out, I brushed the tops with olive oil. It really softened it up, but still has just enough of that homemade crunch.  I&#39;m excited to try variations including whole garlic cloves, apple and cinnamon, chocolate pudding mix and chocolate chips and herbs and cheese.   We may never buy store bought bread again!!"
5.0,"Absolutely the easiest and most delicious bread.  Came out perfect the first time.  OMG, my husband and kids had the first loaf down by the evening.  Will be making this on a regular basis.  I have had terrible success with my bread maker, although I will continue to try to find the perfect recipe for it."
5.0,"I&#39;ve always had issues making home made bread. This recipe has not let me down yet! The only thing I do differently is form the loaves by hand, make a few slashes at the top for decoration, and sprinkle a little corn meal on a greased cookie sheet. It makes the loaves come off the pan easier. These loaves go fast!"
5.0,"Delicious, very easy... we don&#39;t use sugar, we use honey instead, and it is just divine!!  My loaf pans are slightly smaller, so I&#39;m able to break this into 3 even loaves.  I&#39;ve made it twice already (6 loaves total) Never buying store bread again!!"
5.0,"Two loaves were gone in one day (family of 6). I&#39;ve used other recipes, but this was hugely successful!"
5.0,"My first time, and it was perfect.  Slices wonderful for sandwiches, and delicious.  And myfamily loved it, they said more, more, more."
5.0,"I really can&#39;t get over this bread. I made 2 batches every week. I usually substitute 1 1/2 cups of AP flour with whole wheat. It&#39;s just lovely. Actually, I just made some except after letting it rise, I took one loaf worth,  kneaded in about 1c. raisins, then rolled it out rubbed on some butter and sprinkled on cinnamon sugar (1 1/2 tbspn cinnamon, 3tbspn brown sugar), and rolled it up, let it rise and baked like the recipe says, and ohmygoodness. Best raisin bread I have ever had. Just came out of the oven. mmmmm"
5.0,"The first time I tried this my yeast was expired, the water was too warm &amp; I didn&#39;t wait long enough for the yeast to dissolve. Needless to say, the bread didn&#39;t rise and wasn&#39;t very good. While the &#34;bad&#34; loaves were in the oven I started a new batch with fresh yeast in the right temperature water &amp; showed some patience letting it dissolve, the result was 2 beautiful loaves of bread! Such an easy recipe - if you follow it! I can&#39;t wait to try some of the suggested variations."
5.0,"This is my first homemade bread recipe and it will be my last,  there is no need to look elsewhere!  I don&#39;t knead it the 8-10 minutes as directed,  usually 5 minutes and it rises fine each time.  It will not rise as much with sea salt but I like the taste a little better.   Believe it or not, I am losing weight while eating this bread but only allow 2 slices per day with little other carbs...so you can lose weight and eat delicious homemade bread!"
5.0,Easy peasy!
5.0,We LOVE this bread! It&#39;s so simple and easy to make and it tastes great. My husband can&#39;t get enough (and that&#39;s saying a lot since he&#39;s not much of a bread eater).
5.0,"I love this! I started with the recipe as written down and it turned out beautiful each time! I have started making this with whole wheat flour (half all-purpose, half whole wheat), and making a cinnamon raisin version I read in one of the reviews that is awesome! It is my first and last bread recipe and is sooooooo good!"
5.0,Great flavor.  Made 23
5.0,Really enjoy these cupcakes.  The caramel frosting is such a great combination with the almond and spice flavor of the cake.
5.0,"I have an amazing zucchini muffin recipe that I have been using for decades. But I wanted to branch out. I was glad I did! I liked the almond extract and the caramel frosting is terrific. The texture is amazing too, a nice not too dense, but thick enough consistency. Cinnamon and cloves are just right and not overwhelming."
5.0,"I have been making these zucchini cupcakes since the recipe first came out in 1997, and it remains my favorite to this day. I make it exactly as written - it is perfect!"
5.0,"Made in a 13x9 glass pan 30 min at 350. Powdered sugar not on ingredients list and didn&#39;t have any, so just put carmel sauce on top. Very yummy."
5.0,Absolutely scrumptious!!  Definitely in the &#34;Let&#39;s do this again&#34; category.
5.0,"This was one of the first recipes I made when I began subscribing to the Taste of Home magazine in the 1990&#39;s.  I made the cupcakes for a outdoor concert I was going to on a summer evening. Delicious, moist spice cupcakes with a wonderful butterscotch icing. They were a big hit with my friends. Couldn&#39;t eat just one."
5.0,"Yummy! Even my vegetable-hating grandchildren loved these cupcakes! They were moist and tasty even without the caramel topping. With the caramel, they were out-of-this world! I&#39;ll have to plant more zucchini!"
5.0,"I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;d reviewed this recipe before, so I&#39;ll do it now  I used half and half cream instead of the milk for the frosting and followed recipe for the basic cupcakes.  However, I baked 7 cupcakes and three 5&#34;x3&#34; loaves I iced the loaves right away and thinned frosting with about 2 to 3 Tbsp. more half and half cream. This is a real winner of a recipe as it had been in one of the contests!"
5.0,"I rarely bake anything that doesn’t have chocolate in it, but this recipe looked so good I had to try it. I followed the recipe exactly, and the cupcakes and frosting were scrumptious! The only thing I would do differently would be to start checking them after 15-18 minutes, as they weren’t quite as moist as I would have liked when I removed them from the oven after 20 minutes. But I am definitely adding this to my list of favorite recipes!"
5.0,"The first two loaves I made were gone in less than two days. My kids were in love. Then I made two more and those were gone almost as fast. I have now made a total of 8 loaves and we stopped buying bread from the store. I cook it 30 mins, baste them with butter and then cook them 5 more minutes. Then I baste them again when I take them out. I didn&#39;t have canola oil so I just use vegetable and it&#39;s amazing!"
5.0,easy enough for my kids to help! smells great baking and tastes wonderful! yummy!
5.0,Huge hit with the family!!
5.0,"Very simple recipe - I love that it only has 6 ingredients and uses all purpose flour.  I did a cost analysis, and this recipe costs me less than buying store bought bread.  It comes out to about $0.05 per slice, which is pretty cheap.  And it really doesn&#39;t require much effort.  It does take some time, but most of that is from rising and baking and I can still do other tasks while that&#39;s happening, so I think it&#39;s worth it.  I&#39;m definitely going to be using this as my go-to bread recipe from now on.  My family loves it!"
5.0,"My neighbor across the street (Carolee) and I both just happened to make these cupcakes!  Carolee followed the recipe exactly except she used yellow squash (instead of zucchini) and used 1 3/4 cups grated (instead of 1 1/2 cups) ...  she also put toasted walnuts on top of some.I made them a bit differently.  I used vegetable oil (instead of canola), I used 2 cups of grated zucchini (instead of 1 1/2 cups) and I put the batter in a greased and floured 9X13 cake pan.....  baked at 350 degrees F.  for 25-30 minutes.  I also added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the icing and, after icing the cake,  topped it with 2/3 cup chopped and toasted walnuts.Both versions were extremely tasty!!  The cake is moist and not too sweet, like some zucchini cakes ......  the icing tops off the cake perfectly.  My cake tasted almost like carrot cake ....  probably from the extra cinnamon in the icing.We will both be making this cake again!!!  Five star rating for sure!"
5.0,"just made these tonight and was very impressed.  I didnt double the icing recipe but did increase it a bit..  It made enough to ice 1 1/2 dozen cupcakes and then some!  Yes, the icing was to die for.  I increased the shredded zucchini alittle cause I wanted more vegies in them. I will definitely be making these again!"
5.0,"Love, love, love the frosting. I  wouldn&#39;t necessarily consider this a cupcake, more like a quick bread; however, it is tasty.  I love the orange juice in the batter."
5.0,"Awesome!  I loved the taste and texture of the cake.  The icing was very sweet, but still delicious!  I had a lot of icing leftover, so I would halve the recipe for the icing next time.  This is definitely a winner!"
5.0,"The zucchini cupcakes were very moist and flavorful.  I usually see zucchini cake paired with cream cheese frosting, so I thought the caramel frosting was really unique, and delicious!"
5.0,The icing was the best part of these!!! The cupcakes themselves were quite delicious but the icing definitely topped these off.
5.0,These cupcakes are excellent! Batter made 22 cupcakes instead of 1 1/2 doz. Only change I made was added 1/2 cup raisins to batter at end. I almost increased the frosting ingredients slightly.
5.0,"Since we had many zucchini squash in our garden this year, I used some to try this recipe.I wasn&#39;t sorry I did, they are delicious!"
5.0,"These cupcakes are absolutely delicious! We always have so much zucchini in the summer, this is a keeper, I made the recipe as stated, just doubled it, and still feel like there aren&#39;t enough to go around. :)"
5.0,Made these for Christmas! I love these!!! The icing is super easy and comes right out of the pan without sticking to it at all. I put it in a ziplock bag and cut off the corner and wala! Perfect!
5.0,I made these last summer when zucchini was in adbundance.  Did make one change - used lemon juice and zest instead of the orange juice.  Lot of leftover frosting - but why am I complaining?  Delicious.
5.0,These cupcakes were great
5.0,Very good!
5.0,What a great way to use zucchini!!  The frosting is to die for-- and it&#39;s not even chocolate!!  I double it and pile it on each cupcake!  I can easily get 2 1/2 dozen from this recipe  Then there&#39;s more room for frosting!!
5.0,This is the second time I&#39;ve made these.  They are very tasty and moist.  It took 16 min for 18 cupcakes. I used 1 cup sugar and I found them still a little too sweet.  I omitted the cloves because my family doesn&#39;t like them.  They are delicious even without the frosting!
5.0,Made it in a 9x13 and came out great.  Hard to beat spiced cake and caramel frosting.  This will definitely be made again
5.0,"Delicious. Yummy frosting. I have been making these for s few years now.  As soon as zucchini appears in my garden, the cupcakes are never far behind!!!"
5.0,My sis made these.  I would have never made a zuchinni cupcake but I sure am glad she did.  Now one of my favorites.  The combination of flavors is perfect; the frosting is delicious!
5.0,I took these cupcakes to work and they didn&#39;t last long.
5.0,Delicious!!
5.0,I have made these numerous times and everyone loved them! The frosting is the so-called icing on the cake! Love these!
5.0,I made these yesterday and they were fantastic!  The frosting was amazing and really took it over the top.
5.0,"Took these to our Bunco game night.  They were a hit.  I didn&#39;t have any orange juice or almond extract, so I used lemon juice and lemon extract and they were very good.  Moist and flavorful.  The frosting was just the needed touch of sweetness to the cupcake.  Will definitely be making again"
5.0,"Just made these following the recipe exactly.  Very good!   It is also a very good, not-too-sweet &#34;muffin&#34; without the frosting.  Adding raisins would be an option.  A &#34;keeper&#34; recipe!"
5.0,"Loved these cupcakes! Not overly sweet or heavy. Most of the sweetness comes from the frosting, and the cupcakes wouldn&#39;t be near as good without it."
5.0,I&#39;m always looking for every possible way to use extra zucchini in the summer time! This recipe was a wonderful sweet treat! We really enjoy these!
5.0,Very nice recipe  . I like that the consistency is cake like rather than like many other  recipes which are heavier and taste more like a muffin. The icing tops this off beautifully and takes it up a notch for sure.  I peel my zucchini as is our preference. People that dislike zucchini would not even know zucchini is in this when peel is not present as it just imparts a moisture to the cupcake .Raisins or pecans would be a great addition to the batter.
5.0,"These were fabulous. Loved the frosting, but cupcakes are fine without it too. Didn&#39;t have any almond extract so finely chopped about a 1/4 cup of almonds in it. Maybe that&#39;s why mine were great without the frosting too, almonds added a touch more flavor and a bit of crunch."
5.0,Flavorful and creamy. Loved the variation from regular chili!
5.0,This was superb!  I was really easy to make too.  I highly recommend it.
5.0,Oh my gosh...this is not only one of the easiest recipes I have made...but also one of the yummiest. LOVE IT. Also a great way to use left over turkey.
5.0,Very easy and very delicious!! This is a keeper folks!!  Next time may add some mushrooms and red bell pepper to bulk it up a little...but don&#39;t *have* to.
5.0,"This is a great recipe! I wish I had a contet to enter it in. The next I have a craving for chili, I&#39;ll make this. Mmm mmm good!"
5.0,This is one of the best White Chili recipes I have found.  I made it for a dinner party where one of the people is a very good chef.  She thought this was so good and requested the recipe.
5.0,I tried this on my family and my daycare girls and they all loved it and want it again
5.0,I&#39;ve never made white chili before and wanted something different for our church chili cook-off.  Made this recipe and won 1st place!! Excellent and very easy to put together.  I made it in advance but did not add the sour cream and whipping cream.  About 20 minutes before serving time I added the two ingredients and heated through.  YMMMM
5.0,"This is a family favorite!  I use canned chicken, reduce the broth and add a can of corn.  Perfect with hot cornbread!"
5.0,"Quick and easy to make, my family asks for it all the time. I don&#39;t add the green chiles, instead I use &#34;ghost chiles&#34;, a very small amount. Adds a lot of heat and a wonderful smoky flavor. Delicious!"
5.0,This was so good.  The only thing I would do is leave out the salt and use lower sodium broth.  It was great just too salty.
5.0,Wonderful recipe!!!! I used 8oz light cream cheese instead of the cream. Cuts way down on the fat.
5.0,"I cut the calories and fat way down by using nonfat sour cream and substituting nonfat (skim) evaporated milk for the heavy cream and it is still yummy, a family favorite!"
5.0,Wonderful!  Moist and delightful.  Unfortunately I was out of almond extract so I had to use vanilla.  Next time I&#39;ll definitely use almond; I&#39;ll also reduce the cloves to 1/4 teaspoon as they&#39;re a bit overpowering for my taste.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be baking these again.  The caramel frosting is delicious and plentiful!
5.0,"Super yummy! I love these cupcakes, and the frosting is delicious. New favorite cupcake recipe."
5.0,Very moist! My family loved them.  I didn&#39;t frost the cupcakes and we ate them as muffins with soup. Definitely making them again. They freeze well too.
5.0,Very tasty moist cupcakes. The caramel icing is out of this world with the spice cupcakes. I will definately make these again when I have an abundance of zucchini!
5.0,These zucchini cupcakes were a hit!  I took them to a potluck and they were gone in minutes!  I added 4 oz. of cream cheese to the batter because my frosting didn&#39;t whip up like I would have liked!  These are definitely worth trying!
5.0,I ate some of these. They were delicious!! She added about a 1/2 cup -3/4 cup of bluberries. Really good!!
5.0,"These were so yummy! I used ground all spice, instead of ground cloves. Worked great!"
5.0,Added applesauce for oil and orange extract for juice...awesome and nice and moist. The frosting is very good. Will make again!
5.0,These are delicious! I didn&#39;t have orange juice so I substituted equal amount lemon juice and it worked well! The frosting is delicious!
5.0,"These are delicious.  They are light textured and the frosting is easy. They are not too sweet, either, just right!   I am so happy to have this recipe.  Everyone who ate one thought they were just yummy!  I will make again and again. Always need zucchini recipes.  Thanks!"
5.0,I made this recipe as written two times.  I have also just made them with whole wheat flour.  They are good either way.  Frosting is delicious but not necessary.
5.0,"this recipe came out yeaer ago, when my 21 year old son was in preschool.  He loved these so much he wanted me to make them for his class on his birthday.  Well, needless to say, a bunch preschoolers and the word zucchini did not go over too well. But he was delighted!"
5.0,"This is by far the BEST cupcake recipe out there!  The frosting is the crowning glory to this moist cake.  Do not hesitate to make these, only be prepared for everyone to ask you for this recipe."
5.0,"I didn&#39;t put on the frosting. They didn&#39;t need it, my husband thinks frosting is too sweet and I have to watch my sugar intake so a win-win all around.  This will be the zuke muffin recipe I&#39;ll use from now on!  Thanks! (Oh.. I did use only half of the amount of the spices.. our preference..)"
5.0,De
5.0,Holy Cow!!!  These are amazing!!!!  So good.
5.0,"Made this into a bundt cake, came out delicious!  The orange juice makes it taste so good.Going to make into Zucchini bread, grandkids loved it!"
5.0,"Delicious,  will be putting the frosting on a zucchini cake I am making"
5.0,Delicious Cupcakes!!!  Moist.  Frosting is yummy!
5.0,What a great recipe. The cupcakes were moist and the icing was delicious.
5.0,"This is just excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I just had skim milk so added maybe 1 tsp of cream.  When it was time to cool the frosting, I put my pot in an ice bath and cooled it that way, then kept the pot in the bath while beating in the powdered sugar.  I maybe added 1 cup, and it almost was too stiff, unlike other reviewers&#39; concerns that they could not get it to a proper spreading consistency.  Thanks for the recipe .. I will definitely use it again.  Oh, and it made 9 large cupcakes/muffins."
5.0,"I had prepared this recipe QUITE sometime back!  I prepared it again!  I have adjusted this recipe by adding 1 Tbsp. ground Navel orange and I also added 1/2 tsp. each of all-spice andnutmeg to the other spices and dry ingredients listed in this recipe!  I used 1 cup shredded zucchini with 1/2 cup unpeeled chopped tart apple, rather than 1-1/2 cups zucchini. For the icing, I&#39;d used 3 cups confectioners&#39; sugar-the 2 cups didn&#39;t make for a good spreading consistency!  I&#39;d also just melted the butter with the brown sugar-I didn&#39;t cube the butter.I used evaporated milk and started with 1/4 cup milk, and gradually added UP TO 2 Tbsp.more milk to achieve a desirable spreading consistency!  I did have to stir the frosting with a mixing spoon to make the icing pliable and easier for me to spread.  I also baked cupcakes 25 minutes to make sure that they were golden brown and really baked!  Thank you,Virginia LaPierre, for sharing your recipe with Taste of Home!This recipe IS a wonderful way to use zucchini!  delowenstein"
5.0,"Theses cupcakes are awesome. I am always looking for ways to use zucchini and these hit the spot. The only change I made was that I didn&#39;t have almond extract so I used vanilla and I think they were just as good. I&#39;m not a huge fan of almond extract anyway. The only other note is that the caramel frosting was more like a glaze. I added the 2 cups of 10x sugar and didn&#39;t want to add any more for fear it would be too sweet. Otherwise, this is a keeper!"
5.0,"Oh my! These are outstanding!  I followed the recipe exactly, although for the frosting after cooking the brown sugar/butter mixture, I transferred to a small mixing bowl and placed in an ice and water sink bath while beating in the powdered sugar (used 1 1/2 cups). 18 cupcakes, fluffy caramel frosting. OH MY!"
5.0,These are awesome!!
5.0,My whole family enjoyed this recipe they are great with and without the frosting.
5.0,delicious!!!  I used cream cheese frosting because it is a family favorite.  GREAT CUPCAKES!!!
5.0,"These cupcakes were absolutely wonderful!! One of the most delicious cupcakes I have ever had. The only negative I can say is that the frosting wasn&#39;t really stiff enough to frost with, so I just turned it into a glaze &amp; dipped the cupcakes in it. Still came out awesome &amp; will definitely make again."
5.0,Made this recipe as written except used vanilla instead of almond extract in the cake part. So good! Moist &amp; sweet. It made 2 dozen cupcakes. I didn&#39;t think there would be enough frosting but I only used half because it&#39;s so sweet. Very good caramel flavor. Cupcakes are good without frosting too.
5.0,"Excellent!!! I doubled the recipe to make a sheet cake and a couple of variations to lighten up (hopefully) the recipe. I subbed half of the eggs for whites, half oil for apple sauce, reduced sugar and added more apple sauce.  I didn&#39;t have orange juice so I added 1 Tablespoon of Lemon Juice per batch.  Kids loved it... that&#39;s all I need to know."
5.0,"These cupcakes were a great hit at a recent get together! The caramel frosting combined with the cinnamon spice mixture in the cupcakes, make this a perfect fall treat!"
5.0,"I made these for a party at work, and they flew off the table! The creamy frosting adds just the right touch to a fabulous fall treat!"
5.0,I am rating this recipe as a family treat every year zucchini is out of control in the garden.  The family and work crowd loved it last year.  The recipe passed out to all.   This year though I am making mini cupcakes for the calorie conscious.
5.0,"Oh man, these were SO yummy!  I was surprised that even my picky granddaughter loved them (she ate two and was mad when we wouldn&#39;t let her have another).  I used vanilla rather than almond extract."
5.0,"Oh man, these were SO yummy!  I was surprised that even my picky granddaughter loved them (she ate two and was mad when we wouldn&#39;t let her have another).  I used vanilla rather than almond extract."
5.0,"These cupcakes are yummilicious!!  My dad who doesn&#39;t usually like caramel frosting, actually said they tasted good! I had a little trouble though...couldn&#39;t get the frosting to thicken. Thanks to your grandma for an amazing recipe!"
5.0,The caramel icing is great!
5.0,"These are probably the best cupcakes I have ever tasted!  I have made them a lot over the last couple of years and always get rave reviews.  The last time I made them, I did not have any orange juice but I did have apple juice so I used that instead.  They were actually better which I did not think was possible.  The apple juice changed the texture and they were much more moist and smooth.  I dip the top of the cupcakes in the frosting when it is still warm and it makes a nice smooth finish as I do not like as much frosting as it shows in the picture.  I also make these gluten free for my daughter and substitute gluten free flour and I can&#39;t tell the difference.  I freeze these for her and they are wonderful even months later out of the freezer."
5.0,This is a great way to use zucchini from the garden.  The last time I made them I substituted 1/4 c. of the oil with Lemon Olive Oil and added the zest of one lemon.  Plus added about 1/2 c. soft cream cheese to the frosting.  They disappeared.  Yum!
5.0,This cupcake is so moist and delicious....I had to play with the frosting a bit to get it to the right consistency but the flavor is out of this world..
5.0,"Made this tonight!  GREAT flavors, they blended so well!  Thanks so much! These are so moist and delicious!"
5.0,"I seriously think these are THE BEST things that I have ever eaten!  The cupcakes were so moist and yummy and the frosting... OH WOW!! Delicious :)  If you leave them unfrosted, they are more like a muffin and are still very good. But really, though, you want the frosting!"
5.0,Absolutely delicious!
5.0,This was a great hit as treats my son&#39;s birthday party!
5.0,This was a great hit as treats my son&#39;s birthday party
5.0,The frosting is heavenly!!!  Great way to sneak veggies into the kids.
5.0,"I HAVE MADE THIS RECIPE MANY TIMES, IT IS DELICIOUS!  VERY MOIST &amp; ICING IS WONDERFUL, ADDS SO MUCH FLAVOR TO THE VERY MOISE CUPCAKE.  I ALWAYS HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OF ZUCCHINI.YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THIS RECIPE. THANK-YOU"
5.0,"Just made this on the request of my son-in-law after I posted them on Facebook. They are very good. I used allspice instead of cloves because I didn&#39;t have cloves and they were rather pricey in the store. I also made 12 cupcakes and put the rest in a loaf pan because I only had one cupcake tin. The loaf was good, too, though a little small. I will definitely be making these as an alternative to cupcakes. Would be good for breakfast or a midday snack if you left the frosting off. The frosting was also very good and easy to make."
5.0,Such a good recipe!  Love the spice flavors in it.  I used ground allspice in place of the cloves and it is delicious!  The caramel icing finishes it off perfectly!
5.0,So very good! They are much like a muffin until you put that HEAVENLY icing on them. WOW!
5.0,Wonderful recipe to use up zucchini.  These moist cupcakes can be made by themselves like muffins but the icing is absolutely divine!  Always well received whenever I make them.  Have used the icing recipe on apple and pumpkin cake.
5.0,"These were delicious.  Granted, my frosting looked nothing like the picture (not as fluffy), but the taste of both the cupcakes and the frosting was outstanding.  This won rave reviews with my family, the neighbor kids, and my coworkers (I made a dozen cupcakes for home and then used the rest of the batter to make a small cake that I took to work).  Everyone loved the frosting and I had a bunch left over, so I used it on some gluten-free apple muffins I&#39;d made for my daughter (since she couldn&#39;t eat these).  Would definitely make these again and am going to experiment with a GF version and with using more zucchini.My husband tried to get me to agree that he could have as many as he wanted since &#34;they contain veggies!&#34;  Hahah."
5.0,I made these cupcakes on a whim for a pot-luck picnic.  They were delicious and I had many requests for this recipe.
5.0,These cupcakes are the best! My kids loved them which was the best part! But when I did the frosting it started to melt.....nest time Ill add more cofectioners suger!
5.0,"Really delicious, probably the best cupcakes I&#39;ve ever made.  The frosting is perfect and a great recipe alone.  It&#39;s a wonderful blend of a branny taste with a sweet one."
5.0,"Very tasty,  Since I have an abundance of zucchini , it was a perfect use for some.....Frosting was great also.. A keeper for sure."
5.0,Very good.  These were moist and not too sweet or too veggie.  Delicious!
5.0,Made this for a party we were having &amp; everyone loved them!  I changed them a little to make them gluten &amp; dairy free by using dairy free margarine instead of butter &amp; sorghum flour &amp; xanthum gum instead of all-purpose flour.   They turned out great &amp; no one could tell that they were gluten free!
5.0,"Huge hit!  Everyone loved mine - which I did modify a bit.   I didn&#39;t have OJ so used lemonade.  I figured it was citrusy and would add the needed tang.  But I didn&#39;t think that cloves would work well with the lemon so I skipped that and, for the same reason, used vanilla extract instead of almond.  These were light and airy,  a good cake texture.  The icing was fabulous, a new family favorite.  Let your caramel mixture cool.  Since I didn&#39;t have the time to wait, I cooled it in a ice bath.  Wonderful recipe."
5.0,Great Cupcakes! 5 Stars!
5.0,Moist &amp; Delicious!
5.0,"I love this recipe - great use for all the zucchini in the garden!  I am lucky to live in an area with an Olive Festival, so I have Meyer Lemon Olive Oil.  Substituted 1/4 c. of that for part of the Canola Oil and added the zest of a lemon.  Super fragrant and a great added touch!"
5.0,So easy &amp; so moist!! Everybody loved them!!
5.0,amazingly yummy!! the frosting was so good and the cupcakes were super moist. the family LOVED them:) def make again
5.0,"SO GOOD! I omitted the green chilies because we don&#39;t like a lot of heat and it was still zippy and tasty.  Added 1 cup frozen corn.  Didn&#39;t have heavy cream, so I used 4 oz cream cheese instead.  Also used 3 cloves garlic in place of the garlic powder.  This is a wonderful cold weather meal!"
5.0,My guys LOVED this recipe!  Ask for it on a regular basis now!
5.0,This is the best White Chicken Chili I have ever had.
5.0,"THIS IS MY NEW &#34;GO TO RECIPE!!&#34; I have already e-mailed it! TYVM for submitting it! I added a little white wine,cilantro added 1 c. chicken broth,as I added 2 potato&#39;s at the end as I roasted a spiced up chicken,potato&#39;s the night before for supper. Then used that in this recipe. Chipolte pepper&#39;s would be a nice change also."
5.0,I&#39;ve made this twice this week. It&#39;s great!
5.0,So GOOD! I make this about once a week during the winter time
5.0,"I made this for my husband and a friend and they both loved it! I only used one can of green chilies and I omitted the onions. I added 5 drops of potent hot sauce at the end, as well. It says it yields 7 servings, but I would say this comfortably feeds only 5 people."
5.0,Very good. My family loves.
5.0,"I&#39;ve made this recipe many times for family and friends. Always a Huge hit...even with the pickiest of eaters. I do omit the whipping cream as it gives the chili a sweeter taste...and a lot more fat and calories! I also put shredded cheese, cilantro and lime on top."
5.0,I have always enjoyed White Chili since it doesn&#39;t have the acid that is in regular chili. My friends here in Indiana would always say &#34;what&#39;s that&#34;? Then I began sharing this recipe. One told me all she could do was smile with every bite. I agree. I just love the creaminess and the &#34;just right&#34; spices. I see why it is contest winning
5.0,I have been making this chili for years.  Everyone who tastes it asks for the recipe.  Fantastic!
5.0,Hands down one of the BEST soups we&#39;ve ever had!  The only thing we changed was adding one can of the green chilies instead of two. My nine year old couldn&#39;t get enough!
5.0,Got this recipe from my sister last year and I have made it many many times and even put some in the freezer. It is sooooo good and everyone I have ever fixed it for wants the recipe. I have even made it for a friend that has to count sodium intake. I used no salt broth and seasoned myself. Best chicken chili recipe ever!!!!
5.0,One word:  Phenomenal!
5.0,"great  recipe, made these for party,there were none left"
5.0,Delicious!  I put chopped walnuts on top of the frosting.
5.0,"RAVE reviews from everyone!!!  Do NOT skip the frosting,.. that makes it!  And the bonus is that now I can make my own caramel (without the high fructose corn sryup that all store bought has)!  Excellent, I changed things a bit - a bit more spices, less salt, 2.5 cups of zucchini and I also replace some of the wheat flour with oat flour for a more &#34;healty&#34; benefit,.. result, it was more moist with extra cup of zucchini and also healthier.  Incredible!!!"
5.0,These cupcakes were amazing and we all loved the caramel frosting too!  This will be my &#39;go to&#39; recipe for zucchini from now on.
5.0,"I like this recipe, but would substitute vanilla for the almond extract, as I think it would overpower the more earthy cinnamon and cloves.  Also, I would suggest adding chopped nuts to the batter--walnuts or pecans--maybe a 1/2 cup, depending on your preference.Also, for the frosting, I think you would run into problems adding the melted butter, brown sugar and milk with the confectioners sugar (as a preference, I would subsitute skim milk for the 2%).  I would do the icing a bit differently.  Warm the milk and brown sugar on the stove until the sugar dissolves.  Soften butter slightly in the microwave, then place in a stand mixer and mix until smooth.  Add confectioners sugar and mix.  Add cooled brown sugar/milk mixture to the above and mix until the frosting is combined.   Add additional confectioners sugar to achieve a spreadable consistency for frosting."
5.0,"I forgot to add for the frosting:  After the milk/brown sugar cooks, remove from heat and add the vanilla.  Cool."
5.0,"I received free over grown yellow squash, so I substituted them for the zucchini. It was delicious."
5.0,AWESOME! Smells delicious and tastes even better.
5.0,"The recipe made 24 so I shared them with my parents and some of their neighbors at a senior complex.  Everyone loved them, frosted or unfrosted! Great zucchini recipe!!"
5.0,They were amazing!! I used zucchini fresh from the farmers market. My kids loved them and we shared them with the grandparents!
5.0,"I made &#34;mini&#34; cupcakes for my husband to take to work; half frosted the other half plain.  I ate one of each and they were moist and delectable.  My husband thought I was crazy and said no one is going to eat zucchini cupcakes.  They were gone by the end of the day and two weeks later, he came home with a special request to send in more!!!"
5.0,Everyone that I shared the muffins with loved them! The recipe is now in my recipe box!
5.0,I just love these about as much or more than pear muffins.
5.0,"With the frosting it is definitely a &#34;dessert.&#34;  Without it, you could call it dessert or a muffin, depending upon your individual taste.  Although I love chocolate chips in zucchini cake/bread as much as &#34;the next person,&#34; it really is refreshing to have this one sweetened by the caramel icing.  It&#39;s an original and a flavor combination that works for me."
5.0,This recipe is awesome!
5.0,"After an abundant supply of zucchini I made these cupcakes several times this summer. Some went to work and many stayed home. I got rave reviews for these and even several requests for the recipe. As a TOH field editor I would highly recommend this recipe. It is an exceptionally easy recipe to make, the cupcakes were delicious and the icing was good also. If you wish to speed the icing process up a bit you can place the cooked part in ice and use an electric mixer. This way you can get to the finished product sooner. I froze several packets of zucchini premeasured just to make these in the winter. Try these you won&#39;t be dissapointed."
5.0,"I made these for the women I worked with and they love them even the younger girls loved them they could notbelieve the cupcakes had good for you Zucchini in them!  One lady said she didn&#39;t like Zucchini but she loved the cupcakes, and wanted the recipe!"
5.0,Great way to use zuchinni from my garden!
5.0,"These cupcakes were so good! My family loved them. I made them in the morning, and they were a nice snack for breakfast. I would definitely make these a lot!"
5.0,Mouth watering!  Everyone I made these for loves them!
5.0,Great alternative cupcake.  Family thought they tasted like pumpkin pie in a cupcake wrapper.
5.0,"Wow! I made the recipe as directed. (I did put the icing saucepan in a bowl of ice water when I was beating the icing so it chilled faster.)The cupcake is very delicately spiced, and the caramel icing is sooo yummy! Fortunately I prepared them to share with friends - otherwise I think my family would have wiped out the whole batch on their own!"
5.0,"These were fabulous!  The icing is so tasty, but very sweet.  I did have to add extra powdered sugar to get the right consistency.  The next time that I make these I am going to try adding cream cheese to the frosting. I think the cupcakes were better the second day as the favors had time to meld."
5.0,The better one that I eat!
5.0,So good...
5.0,These cupcakes are moist and have a great deal of flavor. I also sometimes substitute cream cheese frosting for the caramel frosting. Still is a big hit for any event.
5.0,"This was a great recipe - very tasty cupcake - a bit like a spice cake and the frosting went so well with it. Caution, the frosting is very sweet, but it frosting!"
5.0,"These were great, not oily like most zucchini recipes.  For my cooking class, we used a giant zucchini, and scooped out the seeds.  We also cut the amount of cloves to 1/4 teaspoon and doubled the recipe which yielded 45 delicious cupcakes.  Don&#39;t skip the frosting -- it was almost like fudge --yum!!"
5.0,"Very good.  Frosting was very sweet, but that can EASILY be solved by not putting as much on.  How could you complain?!  Nice spice.  I can imagine how they would make good gluten free too!"
5.0,These are amazing!  No one is ever going to know that I am using up my zucchini this way!!  They are so moist and yummy!
5.0,OUTSTANDING!!!
5.0,"I made these cupcakes with my granddaughter and they were delicious. She carefully spooned the flour into the measuring cups without packing...and mixed together dry ingredients just until flour was blended. Her cupcakes were soooo tender.Quite by mistake we ended up making &#39;maple bar icing&#39; instead of frosting by adding two sticks butter, instead of one, and some additional confectioner sugar so icing could be swirled around on top of cupcakes. My oh my, was it ever delicious!!! Will try the frosting recipe next time, but will be keeping the &#39;Maple bar icing&#39; for this cupcake as well. Excellent treat for all ages."
5.0,"Absolutely fantastic like everyone said. I expected nothing less. I too, like others, cut down the sugar and they were still fantastic. Could probably cut even more as icing makes up the sweetness. These tasted fantastic even without icing."
5.0,"I like trying new things and my Mother was talking about making zucchini bread which I don&#39;t believe I have ever eaten, but for some reason sounded good. I came across this recipe. I LOVE carmel so the idea of a carmel frosting on top sealed the deal. I just completed baking and frosting my cupcakes. They are pretty good. Like a spice cake as one review said. They weren&#39;t as moist as I had imagined from the reviews. I think I will make them bigger next time. I don&#39;t believe I made them big enough for the moistness. The carmel frosting is DEFINITELY worth the time and effort it takes to make it. I know I will use it on cakes and other things. It is DELICIOUS! I put the left over frosting in the fridge to put on brownies or something later. Or just eat like carmel. Thank you for the healthy alternative to normal cupcakes. We will see what my coworkers think of it tomorrow when I take it to work."
5.0,"I absolutely loved these you would never guess they have zucchini in them very good, even the icing is delicious"
5.0,These were heavenly but next time I am doubling the caramel sauce and saving half to drizzle over the frosting it was sooo good!
5.0,"This is a very easy recipe to make. The texture of the cupcakes are firm, almost like a sponge cake. They have just the right amount of flavor. I could not pick up on the orange juice flavor in the cupcakes. I followed this recipe exactly, however if you are not a fan of cloves you could easily leave them out and not ruin the flavor. I would suggest if using frozen zucchini to let it thaw in a strainer first.The caramel frosting was very easy to prepare and flavorful. I used a bag to pipe it on. I also helped cool it down by continuously beating with my mixer in a bowl of ice, this way I could add the powdered sugar faster and the frosting became a nice texture quicker. Very good, made a double batch the first time, would definitely make again."
5.0,I made this recipe recently. For the cupcake I followed the recipe exactly<i></i>
5.0,"I have been subscribing to Taste of Home since 1994, which is around the time that this recipe appeared as a contest winner.  I have made it many times and it is fantastic!  Some of the best cupcakes I have ever eaten."
5.0,"Excellent recipe, the cupcakes went to my husbands work and they fought over them!  Very moist and full of flavor!  Thank you"
5.0,I did not use the cloves and the recipe was fantastic without them!
5.0,I followed the recipe to a &#34;tee&#34;.  These cupcakes were delicious.  Texture was perfect.  Icing is wonderful.  Definitely a keeper!
5.0,"I made this recipe using sugar substitute (good hints on the Splenda site on how to bake with it) and added a half cup of ground flax for some added omegas. Moist, tasty and even without the decadent frosting, simply delicious. A real keeper. Thanks for this one."
5.0,I have made this recipe again and again.  I really think it&#39;s the frosting!
5.0,I LOVE THESE CUPCAKES!!!!!!!!  I have amde these many time &amp; each time I get only good compiments &amp; everyone askes for the recipe =D  I also entered them in our local fair this year &amp; got 1st Juges fav. best of class &amp; best of show!!!  My mom craves these cpucakes all the time ;)  Highly recomend them!!!!
5.0,"I&#39;ve been making these since the original recipe came out in TOH. My kids grew up eating these almost every summer, and sometimes with frozen zucchini in the winter. A truly awesome way to use zucchini and enjoy a delicious treat, as well."
5.0,"I am a vegan so don&#39;t use eggs, butter or dairy milk when cooking. I substituted 3 Tbls of water + 1 Tbls of ground flaxeed for each egg used. Like other reviewers, I also substituted applesauce for the oil. and reduced the cloves to 1/4 tsp. As for the frosting, I skipped the one presented here - although I could have used vegan butter substitute, soy milk and vegan cream cheese - and instead made a &#34;streusel&#34; topping using 1/4 C flour, 3 Tbls brown sugar, 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ground allspice (or you could also use pumpkin pie spice), 1 Tbls canola oil and 1 C coarsely chopped pecans, all mixed together and sprinkled on top of cupcakes before they went into the oven. Yum!"
5.0,Just made these cupcakes!  What a great recipe!  So moist and a great way to use up that zucchini!
5.0,"I found that 2/3rd full was a little to much, next time I&#39;ll use less.  Tastes like spice cake, very moist and everyone loved them."
5.0,I brought these to work and they were a hit! Many of my coworkers were suprised that they were zucchini cupcakes. A couple of people thought that the frosting was a little too sweet so next time I will try the suggestions listed here. Wonderful recipe!
5.0,I used rice flour instead to make gluten free and everyone loved them!
5.0,These are so good.  It&#39;s such a nice alternative to zucchini bread and my kids love them!!!
5.0,Wow! These cupcakes are great; the icing certainly sets these cupcakes apart from the many other recipes available. We made some to share with neighbors and they also enjoyed them much.
5.0,I have been making these for years. They are my daughters favorite. She especially loves the icing. They are so moist. Most of the time people wrinkle their nose when I tell them what are they then they are asking for the recipe as soon as they taste of them.
5.0,I&#39;ve been making these cupcakes for years from the original recipe printed in a ToH magazine from the &#39;90s.  They are outstanding!  The cupcakes are moist and spicy.  The frosting is wonderful!  I do end up with more frosting than I need though.
5.0,"<p>May I add...I scooped out all the zucchini seeds prior to shredding the zucs.  Also, I put the shredded zuc in a colander for a while and pressed some of the excess juice out.  I had maybe a tablespoon of liquid drain off the zucs.</p>"
5.0,Very delicious and moist!
5.0,I love these! I didn&#39;t have almond extract so I used vanilla instead in the actually batter they still turned out delicious!
5.0,We love these! Anyone I&#39;ve made them for has asked me for the recipe. The frosting is to die for.
5.0,"I made this recipe today and it was great!  Everyone loved it, and it smells wonderful baking!  The caramel icing just made it that much better!"
5.0,These cupcakes are delicious!  Definitely a new family favorite.
5.0,such a good recipe.! really like the cake and the frosting!~
5.0,I&#39;m not a big zucchini fan but I loved these. My fiance and his kids really like zucchini so I thought I&#39;d try it. I was really impressed and the caramel icing was very good. I definitely will make these again.
5.0,OMG! Made for a bar-b-que.... ALL I HAVETO SAY IS EVERYONE WAS ASKING 4 THE RECIPE. THEY LASTED A WHOLE HR ON TABLE... FRIENDS WANTED MORE LOL I MADE 3 BATCHES FOR 30 PEOPLE ..
5.0,These were very good. Loved the spices and icing made it so good.
5.0,Made these and boy did they get raves!  The caramel frosting was fabulous as well.
5.0,My family loved this chili!! Even my two picky boys ate it up. My husband was vocally disappointed when the last of the leftovers was gone and he has never done that before over leftovers of anything! I will be making this again often.
5.0,"This is one of my husband&#39;s favorites, and I make it on a regular basis during the colder months (which is almost all of them here in Oregon!) I usually reduce the jalapenos and pepper for my daughter and I who can&#39;t handle a lot of spices.  We top it with onions and shredded cheese and serve with cornbread.  Yum!"
5.0,Great recipe!  So easy to make and so full of flavor.  This recipe is a keeper.
5.0,Wow! My family loved this even my picky eaters.  My husband said it&#39;s so good it could win a contest.  I even had to substitute a couple items and it still turned out incredible!. Thank you for the 5 star recipes.  Renae
5.0,"This recipe won my chili cookoff at work today =D I added 1 pound of ground chicken, spiced it up a little more, and used potato flakes to thicken it up a little and it was PERFECT. Glad to see this is a contest winner on the site, as it was in my office as well!"
5.0,Doubled this recipe for a dinner at work.  Raves....
5.0,Terrific and easy!
5.0,"Made a double batch for a work luncheon. They ate the whole thing! Even though there were 9 soups, and it made a large crock pot full! I mixed the everything together, including the cream and sour cream before cooking in the crock pot on high for 4 hours. It turned out wonderful. I also only added 3 cans green chiles (1 1/2 the recipe instead of double) just so it wouldn&#39;t be too hot. Next time I will add all 4 cans because although it had a kick, it wasn&#39;t as much as I like. I also did as others have recommended and used instant potato flakes to make it creamier. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for submitting it!"
5.0,"Very good, I mashed up an extra can of beans to thicken.  A keeper."
5.0,This is the most wonderful white chili. I have made it over and over. It is my families favorite. I make it with the spiciness or without.
5.0,"Served this to a friend just last night. Every time I make it, people rave about it."
5.0,"I cut the recipe in half. I didn&#39;t have fresh chicken on hand, so drained a can of chicken. Yummy! Next time I&#39;ll make the whoe recipe. NO Leftovers! :("
5.0,"Very tasty.  I made the mistake however, in that I put too much broth in and it turned more into a soup then chili.  But it was still good and I will definitely try this again."
5.0,Great Cupcake!  These cupcakes were super moist and delicious.  The icing was a bit sweet but the caramel flavor was excellent .  I will definitely make these cupcakes again.  Everyone LOVED them
5.0,"These were gone in a flash. We did opt for a cream cheese frosting.  A nice light texture, not too sweet, but YUMMY!"
5.0,These were wonderful muffins.  The frosting was the icing on the cake!  Great recipe!
5.0,I tried these cupcakes and gave them away. Everyone just loved them. I had to try one for myself since I was getting such great reviews. They are great. I most definitly will make them again. But keep more than one for myself.
5.0,I&#39;ve already made these 3 times.  Took them to a family get together and they were a hit!!  Really good and moist.
5.0,Very good cupcakes! Great spice flavor in the cupcake combines really well with the caramel frosting! My husband said it&#39;s THE best cupcake he&#39;s ever had! I made them exactly as written. It made exactly 24 perfect size cupcakes. Will definitely keep this recipe handy to use often!!
5.0,Absolutely loved these cupcakes. Loved the carmel frosting on the spicy cake.
5.0,"Were easy to make, tasted great...quite moist. Did add some cream cheese to the original frosting."
5.0,"Made the cupcakes for friends and it was a big hit.  Great way to use up the extra zucchini in the garden.  The almond extract makes it unique.  It is also delicious with Philadelphia Cream Cheese frosting, although the maple is very good and easy to make.  Cream Cheese gives it a different but excellent flavor also."
5.0,"WOW, this is a great recipe, I did add nuts and raisins. I will make this again and again."
5.0,I have made these for years and my kids gobble them up!  I never drain the zucchini and they always come out moist and perfect.
5.0,Sooooooo delicious!!!  Can&#39;t wait to make them for my grandchildren and Agape Celebration at church.  Great even without the frosting.
5.0,Delicious! Love the frosting!
5.0,"Very delicious, but for me I&#39;d cut the cloves by half or leave them out and use applesauce instead of oil. My family enjoyed the smell of these as they were cooking just as much as when they got to eat them!!! Will definitly use the frosting on other breads, YUMMY!"
5.0,"Absolutely scrumptious! I am with the reviewer Sillygirl- I do not peel or seed my zucchini or squeeze out moisture. I used a smallish tender zucchini. The cupcakes turned out beautifully. I wasnt sure about the frosting either, although it turned out ok and tasted Outrageously fabulous- next time I will add cream cheese and more confectioners sugar to make the frosting more fluffy but still have that fabulous carmel taste! The flavors are the best! Great recipe find! Thanks- Loved it!"
5.0,OMG these are wonderful I made them yesterday and another batch today. The icing is really good and I also did some with a Cream Cheese icing. And they even taste just as good with no icing.
5.0,Great recipe.  Very easy to make and everyone enjoyed them
5.0,I make these every summer and we all love them!
5.0,I made 24 mini muffins and 12 regular muffins with this recipe......delicious!  I didn&#39;t peel or drain the zucchini and used half green and half yellow zucchini.  Men especially loved the frosting.
5.0,"Delish!. I had to use extra powdered sugar to get the frosting a little thicker, but it was a fantastic flavor! Will def.make again!"
5.0,"They were delicious!!  I&#39;ll definitely make them again... I didn&#39;t make the frosting though,, maybe next time,,but instead I put on my favorite which is Cream Cheese Frosting..."
5.0,"I made the cupcakes for a potluck and was more than pleased with the flavor.  All those that tried them, loved them."
5.0,Yummy and semi-healthy!  Even those who gave me a funny look when I told them what kind it was were happy they tried it. I am ready to make some more this weekend!
5.0,This is our new favorite zucchini recipe.  The frosting is just like my mother in law&#39;s Danish fudge.
5.0,<p>I have already written something about this recipe but I have to write again.  Previously I used my mom&#39;s zucchini recipe and this frosting recipe.  I decided to try this recipe just as it is written and they were incredible.  I did not drain the zucchini either...and there was a lot of liquid too.  This is how good they are...I first made them and accidentally added 1 third cup sugar instead of 1 and a third cup ( my bad handwriting).  My 6 nephews and nieces ran in from outside and grabbed one even though I told them what I did.  They were all gone in less then 5 minutes!!!  I personally didn&#39;t care for them but they still raved about how good they  were.  I then made a second batch...to me it was much better:))</p>
5.0,Really good. I used apple juice instead of orange and cream cheese icing. Worth making again.
5.0,"Between having a crazy amount of zucchini to use and it being a lovely cool day, my friend and I wound up at this webpage and we just gotta say -- DELICIOUS. The spice and caramel combination is just awesome."
5.0,These are absolutely wonderful!!!
5.0,"These cupcakes are great! I reduced the sugar in the cakes to 1 cup, and they were still plenty sweet enough."
5.0,These spicy cupcake are awesome!This will be made over and over!
5.0,"This is a very good recipe; thanks!*Yes, drain the zucchini.*"
5.0,"Firstly, I never peel or seed my zucchini.  My mom&#39;s recipe for the cupcakes are similar so i just used hers.  I made the frosting and it was more like a glaze..should i cool it completely before adding conf. sugar?  Instead of putting it in when it&#39;s lukewarm?  It definately did not look like the picture.  I then added a pack of cream cheese and more conf. sugar and it turned out fabulous!!"
5.0,"followed another&#39;s advice and cut the sugar to 1 cup, replaced a little over half the oil with applesauce. Baked in bread loaf pans, one with walnut pieces, another with blueberries at 375 for 45 min. Cut the frosting recipe in half, and added more milk to make a glaze. Yummy!"
5.0,This was so good and easy.  The only changes I made were to use a whole roasted chicken cut up and instead of whipping cream I used fat free half and half.  It turned out great.
5.0,"This chili is great. The only changes I made: I doubled the recipe, used 1/2 heavy cream and 1/2 half &amp; half and added 2 extra cans of green chilis. My family really liked it but my son (who doesn&#39;t like sour cream) thought the sour cream flavor was too strong so next time I will cut the sour cream in half. This recipe is definitely a keeper."
5.0,This recipe is really good! My picky brothers devoured it.
5.0,I made a double batch of this but put in only half the chilies since we don&#39;t like spicy.  I also used a bulb of fresh garlic!  Absolutely delicious!
5.0,My fiance and I made this for the first time tonight... and it was AMAZING! It was a delicious balance of cream and spice. We would recommend this to anyone!
5.0,This recipe is very simple and tastes great.  I add a can of Rotel and use one can of chilies.  Delicious!
5.0,Very simple to make with great taste! Very nice change. I made this in the crock-pot all day on low. Amazing! Plan to make this for dinner with friends after Christmas serice. Cant wait!
5.0,"This Chili was a hit with adults and kids.  Garnished with some grated mexican cheese, and it made it cheesy licious.  The only thing I thought it lacked was some veggies...I thought maybe some frozen corn could be added...next time, I will try that."
5.0,"This soup was a hit!  It was easy and quick to bring together.  The only thing I did different was add a fresh jalepeneo to the canned chillies.   I think it could benefit from some more veggies, like corn.  The other thing I noted was that to me, it seemed salty.  I think next time I make it, I will cut back on the salt added and add some corn."
5.0,made just as it said to was great husband even asked about it
5.0,made just as it said to was great husband even asked about it and said it was very good.
5.0,This recipe is amazing!!!! I wanted a unique chili to enter in my first contest and I wont third place.  The top three chilis were very close in points and everyone was raving about this chili!  I didnt hear ONE person complain about it.  I doubled it because of entering it into a cook-off and I also added two jalepeno&#39;s to give it a little bit of spice.  A+++ for this recipe!!!
5.0,This is great anyway but after making it at least 20 times now i have some suggestions. Add an extra can of great N. beans and thicken the soup with some cornstarch or flour. Use Tillamook brand sour cream there is a HUGE difference. Iv&#39;e tried both.
5.0,"First time I&#39;ve made a white chili.  We loved it.  I used only one can of chilies and it was plenty of heat for us.  Next time I may add another can of beans, but it is thick enough with the just the two."
5.0,Wow are these good!  My husband who does not really like zucchini really loves these cupcakes.
5.0,With the abundance of zucchini in our garden it made sense to try this recipe and am I glad I did!!!!I took the cupcake to work and everyone RAVED about them!! The ones I left at home the kids ate up and wanted more! I did not frost my cupcakes and no one noticed!!I actually shred my zucchini and vacuum seal it in 1 cup bags then have it in my freezer when I want the taste of summer in the middle of the winter!Thanks for sharing the recipe it is awesome!
5.0,I like to make these cupcakes with only half of the frosting.  They are pretty sweet with the whole amount.  I have also served them without the frosting.
5.0,GREAT cupcake the frosting was yummy!
5.0,Best cupcakes I ever made. Great cake &amp; great frosting. They compliment each other so well.
5.0,Very good. Followed the recipe except didn&#39;t add the cayenne which would have helped. Will next time.
5.0,A great change!  Really good.
5.0,There&#39;s another White Chicken Chili from Taste of Home that I usually make that is done in the crockpot and starts with a jar of alfredo sauce.  I decided to make this one because I wanted something that I could make quickly that didn&#39;t have to cook all day.  This tasted similar and we really liked it because it was quick.  I think I will double next time for more leftovers.
5.0,"This was definitely a hit. I didn&#39;t use the Heavy cream at all, I only used the sour cream, and I added a can of mushrooms. Also, I have to wonder if it is coming out different for people that live in different places. I live in Southern New Mexico, we are in the desert and elevated like 3500 ft. It wasn&#39;t thin for me, nice and creamy and DE-LISH!!"
5.0,This is my first time to make a white chili. This is wonderful. It is so easy to make. I used an already roasted chicken from the deli and also added a can of mushrooms. Everything else I kept the same.I made some Honey Beer Bread to go with it.. What and awesome dinner.. The wine was good too.
5.0,"This one was a hit with all the family. I used evaporated milk, instead of heavy cream and didn&#39;t add sour cream during cooking. Everyone added their own sour cream at the table."
5.0,I made it for our staff lunch. It was really good. Thanks for the recipe.
5.0,"My husband and I love this.  Instead of cayenne and green chilis, I use a can of Rotel.  It comes out great."
5.0,"Very good, simple &amp; quick white chili recipe.  I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon."
5.0,"So delicious! The only thing I changed, was I added a can of corn and I only used 1 can of green chilies."
5.0,will do this again--except next time I will use more beans. very tasty. just a trifle thin for us. mushrooms sound like a good idea too.
5.0,"My family loves this recipe.  I altered it and added corn starch to make it a bit thicker.  Plus, we use crushed tortilla chips on top as a garnish."
5.0,I made this with low calorie /fat free substitutes and it was great!  Whole family enjoyed.  Family of 4 ate all of it.  Would make a side salad to go with it next time.
5.0,Extremely tasty!  Easy to make. Will make again
5.0,"Excellent recipe. I add my own seasonings to the meat to add even more flavor. Try it, you won&#39;t be disappointed. Thanks for the recipe!"
5.0,Since I tried this recipe it is my go-to meatloaf. Everyone enjoyed.
5.0,"grandkids loved these, and opa for a sandwich for work"
5.0,These were easy to make and delicious! Mine weren’t as neat looking as the picture and I should’ve diced the onions smaller. The flavor of the sauce is excellent. I will definitely make these again.
5.0,"I love this recipe.  I make it all the time.  I halve the sugar in the sauce as a preference and it comes out perfectly, still sweet and just perfect for our family.  It is one of my family&#39;s trusted favorites.  Thank you for the recipe!"
5.0,"Mu husband loves meatloaf but I have NEVER liked it. I generally find them really dry no matter how much ketchup you drown it.  I reluctantly tried these and I love them. Very easy to make, moist and full of flavor. Great as left overs also. I do use a meat mix of 1/3 lb each of ground beef, veal and pork. I also add some hot sauce to the ketchup-sugar topping for a little more kick and to balance the sweetness. This is a repeat recipe."
5.0,"Used half regular ketchup, half jalapeno ketchup.  So good! Made a double batch, baked them, cooled them, and then froze them solid on cookie sheets and vacuum sealed them."
5.0,I liked the review of using jalapeno ketchup so I diced up a fresh jalalpeno and added it to the meat mixture.  It was very good.  I liked the cheese inside the meatloaf.  Have never done that before.
5.0,"I made this recipe exactly as written. I LOVE it! I will definitely be making this on a regular bases. I wonder how well it would freeze. Freeze before or after cooking? The sauce is very good, perfect glaze."
5.0,My family fell in love with this and keep asking for it again. We give it 5 stars
5.0,"I don&#39;t make any other type of meatloaf except these li&#39;l cheddar mini meatloaves! My entire family, Mom, sisters, moth-in-law all love this recipe. Always a hit!"
5.0,Best ever!!!  I add bell peppers to it and usually double or triple it so I can freeze some for another meal. I have taken it to family reunions as meatballs and everyone wanted the recipe!
5.0,These are the best meat loaf (ves) we have ever tried! My entire family loves them! Just delicious!!
5.0,These are my go-to weeknight meatloaf recipe. They bake faster because they are single loaves and the cheesy flavor is great. Left overs can be frozen for future meals.
5.0,I have been making these for years.  Very tasty and cook quickly.  Leftovers reheat nicely.
5.0,"This is the same recipe my 93 year old mother made and it has ALWAYS been a hit with everyone who is lucky enough to have a slice!  The only thing we did not include is the cheese, however I just recently made it exactly as the recipe states and the cheese is a wonderful, rich addition!  Love this recipe, it&#39;s definitely a keeper!"
5.0,These are hands down the best meatloaf/meatballs recipe I have ever tried. It’s a win every single time.
5.0,I made this as two loaves. My only changes were to use onion powder and I cut the topping in half. I have made it a few times and the kids really like it.
5.0,My boyfriend absolutely loved these!
5.0,"I make two changes.  First I enshroud the peas in a ball of mashed potatoes, the kids get a kick out of discovering the peas and not having to chase them all over there plates.  I also brown the potatoes in the oven.  Second, instead of the ketchup topping I make a good brown gravy, that covers the meat loaf and potatoes. Yum, Yum."
5.0,Very easy and very tasty! This will definitely be a &#34;go-to&#34; dinner for me!
5.0,My family loved this recipe!  Yummy!
5.0,"Made this with my daughter, used a little less milk as I read in the reviews, came out amazing. Will be making this again"
5.0,My aunt brought these fantastic meat loaves to a family reunion about 15 years ago.  I have been making them ever since and my family absolutely LOVES them!
5.0,"This was excellent!  The loaves were so tender and the cheese, oats and glaze gave them incredible flavor.  This may just be my new go-to meat loaf recipe.  If you don&#39;t want to make individual loaves, you can probably make one large loaf and adjust the cooking time.  I will definitely make these little loaves again and again!Volunteer Field Editor"
5.0,These are wonderful.  My husband agrees. They will now be our go to meat loaf recipe. Just delicious. I wouldn&#39;t change a thing.
5.0,These little gems are so tasty!   I keep a few without sauce because one of my kids prefers them that way.  I used ground bison and they are simply delicious!  I’m a Volunteer Field Editor and I love trying and reviewing recipes.  This one does not disappoint!
5.0,Hasn&#39;t anyone noticed the bake time is different from the Total Time comment to the Directions. It is 45 minutes. Love these.
5.0,Great recipe.
5.0,I have been making this recipe for years - from an early addition of Taste of Home.My husband is very picky and this is by far his favorite meatloaf recipe.I have also made it as  large meatloaves and taken  it to church potlucks. Never any left.
5.0,This is my go to recipe any time I make meatloaf.  My family loves it!
5.0,"It took more cooking time then the recipe stated ,  at least 45 to 50 minutes.  And I used seasoned breadcrumbs instead of oats.  And the recipe was amazing!!!!  I will definitely be making this again!!!"
5.0,This is my favorite meatloaf recipe ever!  I&#39;ve been making these super tasty meatloaves since 1999.  I make 6 loaves instead of 8 and cook for 40-45 minutes.  I also cover the pan with foil for the first 20 minutes.
5.0,Loved by everyone!  I doubled the recipe but did not double the cheese or the brown sugar.  The sauce was plenty sweet and could maybe even do with less sugar.  My husband said this was his favorite meatloaf recipe.
5.0,"Quickly became a family favorite.  I have two tips:  One, replace half of the ketchup in the sauce with your favorite bbq sauce.  And two, double the recipe because there will be no leftovers!"
5.0,This is a wonderful recipe.  I also added some horseradish for a little zing
5.0,Easy and delish. The kids loved them too!
5.0,"My daughter said that this was her favorite meatloaf recipe.  Sauce tasted great, and I love that this bakes much faster than a whole meatloaf."
5.0,"No question about it, this is a great meatloaf recipe! Made according to directions. The mini idea made these cute and easy serving. In our opinion you could make half the sauce and still be delicious! As a volunteer field editor with Taste of Home I love preparing classic dishes with a new twist."
5.0,"We have been making cheddar loaves twice a month since the recipe first appeared in 1999.  I like to add dry minced onion to the topping and a little Worcestershire, sometimes I make the loaves around a cube of sharp cheddar instead of grated because some of the grated cheese cooks out."
5.0,Love this meatloaf recipe.  Been making it for years now.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!
5.0,"These are the best!  Just had them last night for dinner.  The only change (because of preference) is using a small can of tomato paste instead of ketchup.  Started making these in 2000 when they were in the annual TOH book.  My son would say if he was ever on death row and had to choose his last meal, it would be these.  I promised him I would make them whenever he wanted so he wouldn&#39;t have to commit a crime to have them for dinner!"
5.0,My husband especially enjoys these moist tasty meat loaves.  I often make these and freeze them when they cool.
5.0,"This is a very delicious way to make meat loaf.  I do not make them individually though, I make one large meat loaf.  Sometimes I use mozzarella cheese also."
5.0,These little meat loaves are wonderful. My wife really loves them!
5.0,I made a few loaves without ketchup for my picky little eaters...  we loved it!  Thanks for the recipe TOH!
5.0,"I have been making this meatloaf since I first saw it in the April/May issue back in 1999!  I still have the original recipe that I cut out and have now laminated!  That is how amazing this recipe is!  When I first met my husband 20 years ago he hated meatloaf.  I tried many recipes and he literally hated them all, until I made this one.  I have never made any other meatloaf since we first made this recipe.  It is super easy to make and it turns out perfectly delicious every single time.  The sauce is absolutely amazing!  I have never changed a thing and everyone who tries it loves it.  Now that we are in our 40&#39;s we are trying to watch what we eat.  So I decided to substitute ground turkey for the ground beef and I kept everything else the same... PERFECT!  It was even more moist than normal.  Beef or turkey, this recipe is absolute perfection!"
5.0,love this even my picky eater husband loved it
5.0,This has been one of my family favorites since the first time I made it!  I have made it in loaves as well as in muffin tins.
5.0,Love this recipe.  Gave it to my daughter and she was happy with it also.
5.0,could you tell me if these can be baked in a cupcake pan or mini loaf pan and if so what temp and how long?Thanks so much!!
5.0,"Quick, easy and flavorful."
5.0,"What a great recipe. I love the presentation. And it helps with portion control.  We freeze them and pull them out whenever we want meatloaf.  Instead of trying to shape my own loaves, i use a 8 loaf mini-loaf pan. Works great. It does make a lot of sauce however. Could probably cut the sauce in 1/2."
5.0,Just made it tonight.  Excellent!
5.0,Fabulous!
5.0,"OMG, this is awesome!! We went gluten-free (for medical reasons) about two years ago, and I have been looking for a good meatloaf recipe ever since!! I made this with gluten-free quick oats and it was perfect. We both LOVED this!"
5.0,My family loves this meal. Espically if you add bacon yum!!!
5.0,absolutely love this!
5.0,My family loved it!  Very easy to make.
5.0,Making this again tonight because it is a favorite at our house. The flavor and consistency are great when hot and even better the next day on a sandwich. I make my mini loaves bigger than suggested - 4 loaves instead of 8. One pound of meat only serves 4 here.
5.0,A friend brought these over after i had my first baby. Very good
5.0,A family favorite...made at least once a month!
5.0,"This smells fantastic when it is in the oven, and it tastes as good as it smells."
5.0,"I have never made white chili before and I was sceptical to try this! I am so glad I did! My entire family loved this! I cooked my chicken lightly in my skillet with onion/garlic, but then instead of cooking it all on the stove, I put it over into my crockpot with all of the other ingredients. I started this in the morning on high and it was ready in 4 hours. (I chose this method because I am a busy mom and I like to start my meals in the morning and then have all the prep work done for me) I served this up with some cajun bread and we had a wonderful lunch! Thank you for another wonderful recipe, Taste of Home! Will be making this one again!"
5.0,This was wonderful! I served it up with some cajun bread and everyone loved it!
5.0,Very good recipe.easy to make.
5.0,Thick and rich. Really enjoyed as an alternative to a traditional chili
5.0,I Have made this recipe a number of times. It is so easy to make and so delicious. I have made it for family and friends. It is awesome!!!
5.0,We love soups and this one is terrific.  Just enough &#34;bite&#34; to be interesting!
5.0,my hubby absolutely loves this! he requests it more than beef chili. my 6 yr old will eat this like its going out of style. never any leftovers in our house.
5.0,This is wonderful. Really quite easy to make and tastes delicious. I love it.
5.0,"Absolutely the BEST chili we&#39;ve ever had!!  I used rotisserie chicken which I added at the last minute, and only used one 4oz can of green chiles.  Oh my, DELICIOUS!!"
5.0,One of the best chili I&#39;ve ever had!!!!!!!
5.0,"I have made this several times and always love the creamy chili on a cold day! I replaced the whipping cream with canned evaporated milk. (skim is what I like- caloriewise)  l also add 1 can creamed corn, and stir in monterey jack cheese. with great results! I top with light sour cream, and chopped green onions. Serve with your favorite corn chips.  My family requests it all the time."
5.0,"Perfectly delicious, confirmed by my husband requesting leftovers for two more subsequent meals! Added 3/4 cup kernel corn, sprinkled cheese on top, garnished with chopped tomato, and a few dollops of guacamole -- beautiful and delicious!"
5.0,I&#39;ve been looking for this recipe for 3 years and am SO glad to have found it.  It is delicious !  My friends loved it as much as I did.  This one will be made again and again.  Love it.
5.0,"This was a big hit. I made a few minor changes to fit my families taste without changing the essence of the recipe.  First of all my daughters do not care for green chilies, so I used only one can. I also pureed the green chilies along with the sauteed onions and garlic. My daughters love the flavor of onions but not the texture.  Secondly we adore the flavor of cilantro, I use it as a flavor enhancer in the majority of soups; so in this case I doubled the amount of cilantro. Additionally I added a quarter cup of rice. My oldest doesn&#39;t like chili texture so because of this and the addition of the rice I used a 48 ounce box of broth. This gave it a chowder consistency that my daughter loved. I used precooked roasted chicken so I added a light splash of lemon juice to cut the &#34;greasiness&#34;.  Lastly to make it healthier I swapped evaporated milk for the heavy cream and plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream. All of the flavors of the original recipe is there and with the minor changes it has become a favorite of my oldest daughter."
5.0,this is the ONLY meatloaf recipe I use.Since 1999 it is still the best.Make it into one meatloaf or 4 minisadd Worcestershire &amp; Siracha  to the sauceall I can say is YUMMY
5.0,"My husband and I loved this recipe, it was great.  Will try it with a little bit less of the sauce.  Will definitely make these again."
5.0,"These are the best  meat loaves, usually I am not a fan."
5.0,Yum!  Loved these!
5.0,I never cared for meatloaf but I love these! They are very moist. We usually double all the ingredients except for the sauce and it is perfect!
5.0,"When I made this recipe for a family gathering I overheard &#34;These are very, very, very good meatloaves!&#34;. Everyone raved about them. The addition of milk, oats, and cheese really extends the meat, so I ended up with lots of leftovers."
5.0,we loved these!!  I usually make cheeseburger meatloaf and decided to switch it up with these...GREAT idea!!   They are so easy to make and the sauce is amazing !!  Definitely a keeper!
5.0,"We LOVE them!! I found this recipe in a magazine about 15 years ago and have been cooking it for my family ever since. I always double the sauce, and serving them with mashed potatoes is a MUST!"

5.0,I love this recipe so much that I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll ever go back to my family&#39;s traditional meatloaf recipe!
5.0,So good! I used plain breadcrumbs and had no problem with the consistency. My husband loved it and our 3 year old chowed down as well. Served with mashed potatoes for tasty comfort dinner.
5.0,"These moist flavorful meatloaves are a favorite for my family who usually do not prefer meatloaf!  I also add a few other herbs and spices such as garlic powder, basil, and thyme.  This is a favorite at my house!"
5.0,"This is the main meatloaf that I make.  I have made changes, though--I&#39;ll top it with barbecue sauce and I also sometimes cook it in my slow cooker (high for about 3 hours).  It is absolutely wonderful!"
5.0,"Have been making this recipe for years! When I was single, I loved being able to make the individual loaves, eating what I could and then freezing the other loaves to eat later. Now I make it for my family all the time. A definite winner!!"
5.0,I have been making this recipe for years &amp; it is our favorite meatloaf recipe . So moist &amp; delicious!

5.0,Three out of four kids liking this recipe is a success in my book!  I used minced onion because it is what I had on hand.  Very easy and quick to make.
5.0,"I didn&#39;t have enough ketchup to make the sauce so I used half ketchup and have cocktail sauce. Made it really zippy! I have made it exactly as is and it&#39;s GREAT, but the cocktail sauce flavor is really tasty too!"
5.0,"I made this using venison, and they were absolutely delicious! Great recipe!"
5.0,Everyone loved this - I put them in a muffin tin for individualized portions.  Easy to freeze.
5.0,"I have never been a meatloaf lover, but this recipe changed my mind. Whole family enjoyed. Well make again!"
5.0,I always disliked meatloaf but my husband loved it.  My mother made this for him and I loved it.  Make it all the time.  Great for company.
5.0,I have been using this recipe for a long time and everyone just loves it.  They all ask for the recipe which I am happy to share. It&#39;s so easy and sooo good!
5.0,"I used ground turkey, added some chopped carrots and minced fresh parsley, and cut back a little on the brown sugar in the sauce. This recipe is super yummy!"
5.0,I have made this a few times and we all love it. This time I was out of cheddar so I used velveeta cheese. It was very good.I also added a envelope of onion soup mix and green pepper.
5.0,VERY GOOD! My husband and I arent huge fans of meat loaf but have eaten it once or twice and really liked it. We made this to give it a try and loved it! The sauce is sweet and so yummy. We didnt change the ingredients but changed the way we cooked it. We put in all as one loaf into a loaf pan and baked it twice as long.
5.0,You&#39;ll never want another kind of meatloaf again!  And it&#39;s easy to make.
5.0,"made these for 2nd time today, this time used a grill pan so the excess fat drains off - worked great.  i prefer to saute the onion before adding to mixture, not a fan of crunchy onion in meatloaf.  i ran out of ketchup today so used tomato sauce instead - tasted just as good."
5.0,"This is the best meat loaf recipe EVER!  Whenever I ask my husband what he wants for dinner, he always asks for these meatloaves."
5.0,"This is the best meatloaf recipe I&#39;ve ever tried! It&#39;s moist and flavorful, and the topping is just the best! I&#39;ve taught my boyfriend how to make them and we have them with creamy potato sticks (you can find that recipe on this website also). It&#39;s just one of our favorite meals we have often."
5.0,My husband and I loved this recipe. I will definitely make again. Great leftovers!
5.0,This is the only meat loaf my family will eat.  It&#39;s Yumalicious!
5.0,Entire family loved them.
5.0,"I make this for guests A LOT! Every single time I am asked for the recipe. It&#39;s easy and everyone loves it. To make one big meatloaf, I double and cook for 1 1/2 hrs. I add the sauce in last half hour. Meatloaf is something not everyone will like-this recipe is the exception. Love it!"
5.0,"Most of my family loved this. I did make a few minor changes to adapt to my daughter&#39;s taste while keeping the essence and taste of the recipe in tact.I took a note from &#34;purplepentacle&#34; using fresh garlic along with toasting and grinding my own cumin seeds.My daughters do not like green chilies so I reduced it to one can. They also love the taste but not the texture of onions; because of this after sauteing the onion and garlic I pureed them along with the green chilies.We love cilantro and use it in most of my soups, so I doubled the amount used.I added 1/4 cup of rice. My daughter doesn&#39;t like the consistency of chili, so because of this and the addition of the rice, I used 48 ounces of broth; this gave it a chowder consistency.To make it healthier I used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream and plain Greek yogurt rather than sour cream.I was in a hurry so I used a store bought roasted chicken. I added a splash of lemon juice to cut the &#34;greasiness&#34; of the chicken.I served it in small bread bowls. It was very stick to your ribs and is now a favorite."
5.0,Absolutely delicious! Everyone loved it and will definitely be making it again.
5.0,Absolutely delicious! Everyone loved it and had perfect flavoring! Making it again very soon.

5.0,I&#39;ve taken this to potlucks and always get rave reviews on it and requests for the recipe.  I love it!
5.0,Family loves it.  Easy and tasty.
5.0,"Love, love, love this recipe. I double the broth for a soupier texture. I have also served it without the sour cream and whipping cream some time - I just called in a chicken green chili soup - you can even add potatoes and call it a stew. As a person that grew up in NM, it is a taste of home. Love, love, love it."
5.0,I&#39;ve been making this recipe since it was first published. I make it into one meatloaf and bake for an hour ( I also reduce the amount of brown sugar to make the topping less sweet) I once suggested trying a different meatloaf recipe and my husband and daughter threatened to leave if I didn&#39;t make this one!

The only change I made was I added ground pork (1/2 burger, 1/2 ground pork) both times and this last time I added chopped green pepper and carrots. 5 stars all the way!"

5.0,This will definitely go in our family favorite cookbook!! Yummy!!
5.0,"This is one of my most requested ground beef meals. I usually double the glaze because it is so yummy! I also double the oats so it makes more. Definately doesn&#39;t taste like a traditional meatloaf at all. More like an indulgent oval &#34;meatball&#34;! You can&#39;t really taste the cheese, it just ads to the richness."
5.0,"This recipe is what my husband and I call &#34;Oh my God Good&#34;!  We LOVED it!  It was, by far, the best recipe for meatloaf I have ever tried.  Just as little FYI, try to use ground beef with the lowest fat content you can find.  Otherwise, the splatter and smoke while baking gets a little out of control!  LOL!"
5.0,This is my husband&#39;s favorite!  It is a regular in our home.
5.0,Yummy! Have been making for years. Very moist. Was great for feeding my son when he was a toddler and wanted to eat what we were eating. Also like the extra dairy in there. Great way to sneak into my son&#39;s diet as he&#39;s not a very good milk drinker.

5.0,"Love these little meat loaves and make them frequently.  I cut the ketchup to 1/3c, the brown sugar to 1/8c or less and the mustard to 3/4tsp.  Makes just enough sauce and cuts down on the sweetness too."

5.0,"This is the absolute BEST meatloaf. Normally my husband refuses to eat leftovers, but he will gladly eat these two (or even three!) nights in a row! These come out perfectly moist every time. Reading the reviews, it sound like some find the sauce to be too sweet, but we love it - it&#39;s delicious and I use every last drop. I haven&#39;t found another meatloaf recipe that comes close to this one!     "

5.0,"To MaikoEmi, after reading your review I thought not doing it. When I checked at 25 minutes, there were lots of liquid, I had to set the oven at 375 for another 25 minutes or more until it was drier. I think you did not waited until the liquid evaporated. Actually it is pretty good and not soft at all."

5.0,I just tried this for the first time and my family loves it. I did have to cook a little longer but I also made a full size loaf. I also drained excess liquid during cooking. I also used Bison meat. I wil definately make again.

5.0,I love meatloaf but wanted to try a different recipe my husband and I love cheese so I decided to give this one a try. It is delicious but do agree there is a bit much brown sugar in it but that can be fixed. Thank you for the idea and love that they are mini so you can pack them in your lunch box for work and have a little hunk of meat to munch on. Will definitely be making this for years to come.

5.0,"I tried this for dinner last night.  It was very good - not too spicy.  I did not have whipping cream in the house, so I served it without that.  In my opinion, the sour cream really mellows and compliments the spices used.  Hubs is not a spicy food lover, but he cleaned his bowl and asked for more!  Would definitely recommend this recipe.  Thanks for sharing, Laura!"
5.0,"Love this chili.  I&#39;m not a fan of &#34;red&#34; chili, so this is perfect.  I&#39;ve been asked to share this recipe many times over, and it&#39;s always a big hit."
5.0,wanted some chili on this very cold winter&#39;s day and this really hit the spot. I used half lb of chicken breast and half lb of chicken Italian sausage because that is what I had on hand. It is fabulous. The aroma got my sleepyhead son out of bed looking for food. Great with cornbread on the side.
5.0,"This recipe is a keeper, it has a very nice flavor. Will make it again."
5.0,"Awesome, enjoyed every bite.  Will definitely make again.  Next time I would make a little spicier ."
5.0,.
5.0,"This is a new favorite in my house.  It&#39;s so quick and easy, but tastes like it took all day.    I modified the recipe a bit - I bake, then shred the chicken.  I also leave out the onions (I hate the texture, but like the taste so I use onion powder).  I also hate the texture of green chiles, so I puree them in the food processor."
5.0,"This is my favorite white chili recipe.  I&#39;ve made it several times.  We found it to be a little hot for our taste, so I now leave out the cayenne pepper.  Sometimes I substitute a 13 oz can of chicken instead  of the fresh chicken breast and cook it in a crockpot on low for 3 or 4 hours, then stir in the sour cream and cream just before serving."
5.0,Awesome white chili.  My husband was skeptical since chili is one of his favorite foods.  He loved it!  It is now a favorite in our house.
5.0,This was super easy and delicious! Will definitely be making again.
5.0,"This recipe tastes so good. I use garlic cloves instead of the powder, and skip cayenne. I already take cayenne caps each day. Loved it!"
5.0,"This recipe is amazing!  I used ground chicken and ground Italian sausage (about half and half), and followed the recipe exactly for everything else.  Cooking the sausage and chicken together adds LOTS of flavor.  It&#39;s turnout delicious twice now.  I highly recommend!"
5.0,A huge favorite in our house!  Just make sure you use good northern beans.  I know that I&#39;ve gotten some canned northern beans that are mushy to begin with.  That doesn&#39;t make for a good chili.
5.0,Fabulous recipe. The best White Chili I have had
5.0,So easy to make and so delicious!! We loved this recipe and will be making it again!
5.0,I have never tried a white chili before but this was delicious and easy to prepare!  This will be part of my regular dinner rotation.

5.0,Delicious
5.0,Really really good!
5.0,"I&#39;ve had white chili before, but thought a creamy-style would be a nice twist. This was so delicious! My husband kept raving about it."
5.0,"This is absolutely delicious - I would give it a 50 star rating if I could. We made it exactly the way the recipe states, we figured if we liked it and we were going to make it again we would make a change then. However it is PERFECT exactly the way it is, we love it!!! I made a batch yesterday (already gone) so I&#39;m making another batch today. Anyone who said they didn&#39;t like it (which is maybe one or two) must have used different brands or something than what we did because this is seriously good.....I can&#39;t wait to have more today!!!"
5.0,"I absolutely love this recipe, and have made it many times since it made its first appearance in Taste of Home magazine back in 2001. The only negative is that it is a bit rich, so it should probably be a once-in-awhile thing!"
5.0,My husband and I loved this chili. Excellent recipe. Lots of flavor.
5.0,This is a crowd winner every time.

5.0,"Wow! I thought it would be good, but this is FABULOUS!! I served it with Cheez-It crackers instead of saltines and it was a hit! This is a keeper!"
5.0,"I added a chopped jalapeno (Texans love their heat), fresh garlic and served with corn bread and had grated cheese and cilantro as  toppers to add a little Tex-Mex to it.  Very good."
5.0,"The flavor here is a nice mild heat tempered by the sour cream and heavy cream. If you do not like heat, omit the cayenne pepper. I made a savory cornbread to go with this (sans sugar), added cheese, garlic powder and onion powder. In place of buttermilk, I used powdered milk and a corn meal/flour premixed, and added a cup of cheese. Nice for a rainy autumn day. Enjoy!"
5.0,Liked the flavor and the touch of heat was good.
5.0,"These dish was terrific!  It was a little spicy for me but my husband said it was just right.  Because of some of the reviews, the only thing I changed was cutting the whipping cream in half and only used 6 ounces of sour cream. Definitely will be one recipe kept in my folder."
5.0,"I&#39;ve made this recipe for years since it was first published. The first  time I made it, I followed the directions exactly and found it a little too spicy with the green chilies.  The next time and each subsequent time, I&#39;ve left out them out and to my family, it&#39;s the perfect white chili."
5.0,"I&#39;ve been making this same recipe for years, and it is always a hit! I add a can of white sweet corn to it and serve with cornbread."

5.0,"I have been making this for years, it is a huge hit. I omitted the whipping cream and add canned milk thickened with a little corn strarch. I also omit the cayenne pepper, it was just to spicy with it."
5.0,"I too have been making this chili since I first received my Taste of Home magazines as a yearly gift from my Mom years ago.  Very easy and very tasty!  Now the weather is here for this recipe to be used alot!  We are steering away from red meat, so this is a winner!"
5.0,Made this recipe exactly as stated except I doubled it. Glad I did because it was gone! Delicious  and quick!
5.0,Wonderfully delicious on this cold winters day!!! I&#39;m an intermediate level cook. I get excited about finding and trying new recipes. And today I&#39;m totally excited! This is just an easy recipe with A LOT of taste! I followed the recipe exactly and won&#39;t change a thing when I make this again. And again. And again. Thank you for the recipe! :-) Happy Eating Everyone :-)
5.0,Every one enjoyed this meal. The heat was perfect for me. I added cheddar cheese to the top and had some tortilla chips with that. Others in my household also added jalapenos and hot sauce as  they like things extra hot I guess! everyone loved it and It was so fast and easy to make.
5.0,This was simple to make but  had a flavor that will  make your family think you have worked all day preparing it.  Didn&#39;t change a thing.  Next time I will try the advice to serve with cornbread.

5.0,loved them..after reading the comments I only covered the mini loaves sparingly with the sauce (only used about 1/3 of the recipe) and they were perfect

I also make it often to bring as a gift meal for new parents, people recovering from surgery or illness, etc., and it is always well received. it comes together so fast, it&#39;s a great &#34;I can make this after work&#34; type of meal. Absolutely delicious!"
5.0,"I really enjoyed this.  I wanted a quick lunch and made do with things I had on hand.  I used a smoked sausage cut into chunks, frozen tortellini, and had to skip the spinach since I didn&#39;t have any.  It was still really good!"
5.0,"What a delicious and simple soup! I cooked it exactly as written, and it was perfect. We especially liked the “slight burn” of the red pepper flakes. Definitely a keeper!"
5.0,This was so delicious I have made it several times.  Question though - could I brown the meat etc and then throw everything in a crockpot on low for 6 hours so it&#39;s ready when I get home?  Thanks
5.0,"The only change I made was using cooked, until browned and caramelized, hot Italian sausage, chopped. I only added amount of tortellini we were having that night, added fresh tortellini the second time.  It’s also freezer friendly, without the tortellini. So simple and so delicious!"
5.0,"Doubled the recipe but used a quart of chicken broth and a bit of extra water, used a big package of baby spinach and 2 packages of <strong>al fresco Chicken Sausage, Sweet Italian Style.  It was so good.  </strong>

<strong>Had a nice rich flavor, took it to my MIL&#39;s for dinner.  She made sure we left enough for 3 meals.  I used an 8 quart crockpot, cooked it for about 3 hours on low.  So very good!! Having for dinner again tonight, my husband wants me to make it again!!</strong>"
5.0,"One of my go-to meals and I have been making for many years. Always a sure fire hit. Can add more veggies or spices if you&#39;d like. Sometimes we use the hot spicy sausage, gives it more of a kick. GREAT recipe."
5.0,"Guys, if you need a fast, easy,  recipe with limited ingredients that you can switch out this is the one!. It comes out fast and great tasting, I substitute swiss chard for spinach, grew mountains of it, threw in half a bag of frozen tortellini as the fresh only comes 5 oz packages at my store. Adjust the red pepper flakes as your family likes. Keeping this one for that need a quick healthy dinner."
5.0,What a delicious surprise! This was easy to make and it was so tasty. I&#39;m not a huge fan of cooked spinach but this was very good. This is definitely going in my file of favorite soups.
5.0,"This is a easy and delicious soup my family asks for it all the time, it’s great for a cold New England day!!!"
5.0,This soup was very good.  I accidentally picked up “Italian diced stewed” tomatoes but it still very good.  I will be making this many more times.  Thanks so much for the recipe.
5.0,"We love this recipe!  Even my very picky teenage sons gobbles it up.  I sub one package of frozen spinach (12 oz), 1/2 package of frozen tortellini and use one pound of sweet Italian sausage.  A great soup!!!"
5.0,"Used hot Italian sausage and used all chicken broth, no water.   Comes together really quickly but has a lot of great flavor!"
5.0,"I used a 9oz package of spinach and cheese refrigerated tortellini because that was all they had. Turned out awesome, so much flavor!"
5.0,We loved it. Making it for the second time because my daughter begged us to make it again.
5.0,"10/10 simple and delicious. I did use hot Italian sausage and celery as well, turned out great! Thank you"
5.0,This is a great recipe.  We subbed Kielbasa sliced thin for the Turkey sausage-added two cans white navy beans (rinsed and drained well).  Low sodium chicken broth.   TASTY and AMAZING recipe!!!
5.0,"Funny thing, I saw this recipe less than 2 days after I saw another very similar recipe on another website.... And  it wasn&#39;t what I was looking for at all.   So I took it as a sign that I should give it a try.  The other recipe didn&#39;t use any meat, but it had carrots &amp; celery with the onion, and it also used zucchini.  I mixed both  ecipes"
5.0,This is very yummy.  Family loved it.  Making it again but wanted to know if you can make ahead or will the tortellini get all mushy?
5.0,I don’t cook often so I like easy &amp; delicious recipes. This one was super easy &amp; has tons of flavor. I did use Italian sausage instead &amp; added 4oz of cheese tortellini. I will definitely be making this again. So happy I tried it!
5.0,"This soup has so much flavor,and we will be making this dish from now on. I doubled my recipe and even leftovers were amazing."
5.0,"I love this soup! A friend passed it to me and it’s so so good!   If I have frozen “refrigerated” tortellini , should I cook first or thaw &amp; add?  Thx!   Submitting this comment for 2nd time because I forgot to click the stars??"
5.0,"Amy, I&#39;d suggest that you just add the frozen tortellini to the soup and let it simmer until the pasta is done - it should only take a couple of minutes more than indicated for the refrigerated tortellini alone.   This has become my husband&#39;s favorite cool-weather soup.  I&#39;ve found that we always have leftovers with just the two of us and the tortellini tastes great in this soup, but it absorbs a large amount of the broth after the first day and kind of &#34;takes over&#34;.  I discovered that replacing the tortellini with fresh gnocchi is a fabulous substitution and the gnocchi is much better behaved in the leftover soup."
5.0,"I made this a couple of months ago and my husband, who is not a fan of soup, mentioned it tonight and would like to have it again. We did not have much leftover when I made it so it was definitely enjoyed by our children, too."
5.0,I’ve made this a couple of times. Very flavorful and filling. I love this delicious soup.
5.0,My husband said “This recipe is a keeper!”   I don’t hear that very often from him.  Great taste with a little “zip” to the broth.   Will definitely make this again.
5.0,Awesome soup!  Great flavor and very flexible for what’s on hand. House smelled like Italian restaurant and everyone loved!  We like the kick red pepper flakes adds so we use about 1/4 teaspoon. As a volunteer field  editor with Taste of Home magazine I love great tasting dishes that are easy to customize!
5.0,oh my goodness!!! this came out so good! i did switch out the pepper flakes for cayenne since i didn&#39;t have the flakes. so yummy! unfortunately my kid didn&#39;t like the spinach (eye roll) cant please everyone
5.0,"Best soup,I always double it . My husband is not a soup eater and he requests this soup every two weeks. When I make this my mom has to come over. Thank you for this yummy soup."
5.0,"Great recipe that makes a delicious meal, and will be on repeat this fall and winter.  Easy skill level and quick.  Per other reviews, I used all chicken broth in place of water and added (1) 15 oz can great northern beans.  I had a 16 oz package of tortellini and used it all, the liquid was sufficient for that amount and it makes a heartier portion.  It is perfect as is but next time I am going to add a parmesan rind for extra rustic taste."
5.0,"Absolutely love this! It was also actually easy to make. No hidden steps in between the other steps to prepare food for cooking. Used pre-chopped container of onion, and pre-minced garlic to make this even faster with no chopping. Made exactly per recipe (using sweet italian sausage) -- no swapping out water for more chicken broth, and it was perfect. If I had made that swap, as some readers did, it would have been too potent for our taste. Recipe perfect as is."
5.0,I love this!  It&#39;s tasty and easy.  Just right for a light meal.
5.0,Husband and I love this recipe. Easy to make!
5.0,Simple and quick and very tasty. I would use regular chicken broth instead of reduced sodium. It was good using the reduced sodium broth but just a little better after I added some salt.
5.0,"Simple, easy and fabulous flavor!!! I made it per the recipe and wouldn&#39;t change a thing. It was hearty and flavorful - could not stop eating it! Shared with a friend - will put this in the favorites book!! Serving suggestion - good warm crusty bread with roasted garlic and a glass of red wine!!!!"
5.0,WE LOVE THIS SOUP I HAVE MADE THIS PLENTY OF TIMES
5.0,Wonderful Soup very tasty
5.0,"Pure comfort food, purely perfection. I chose all fresh organic ingredients and used spicy chicken sausage. I seved this soup with some warm buttered Italian bread."
5.0,"Excellent, hearty, and easy to make.  I added a &#34;dash&#34; of red peppers as directed and it was enough that I will be a bit lighter on my dash next time, it doesn&#39;t take much to flavor the soup.  Obviously, that is a matter of taste.  Definitely one I will make again."
5.0,Love this soup!
5.0,I make this soup often. serve it with rolls and a salad.
5.0,This was great. I used spicy Italian sausage and sausage tortellini loved it
5.0,This is a great tasting and hearty soup with bursting flavor.  I like it with a rustic French bread.  My family loves it!
5.0,"This soup is amazing?? my husband and I loved. The second time I made it I left out the tomato&#39;s, and used shredded chicken instead of the sausage &amp; mozzarella and chicken tortellini instead of just cheese and it is now one of my top favorite meals.."
5.0,"This soup is beyond amazing! It is the best tortellini soup on the planet, prepared exactly as written! WOW!"
5.0,"I love anything with green chilies in it and this was great. I could have eaten the entire pot it was so good. Our weather became winter overnight, 28 below the other night, and this was hearty, tasty, and super easy to make, the perfect cold weather recipe. I had to make a few adjustments because I live in the country and didn&#39;t want to navigate the icy roads just to get the few ingredients I was lacking. I looked up substitutions  for heavy cream and sour cream on the internet and I am certain it was close. I used fresh garlic and added red pepper flakes because I love them and add them to whatever I can get away with. I would add them to my coffee if it would work. Thank you Laura for this great recipe, I am debating whether to make another batch tomorrow. I usually share what I cook with family that lives close by but I want to hoard this it is so good. I don&#39;t review many recipes but this one was worth searching for my login info to leave my comment."
5.0,EXCELLENT IS ALL I CAN SAY WITH CORNBREAD MUFFINS!!! YUM YUM ;)
5.0,Made this hearty chili tonight for dinner and my family really loved it!  It has a nice combination of flavors and is really delicious.  I will be adding Creamy White Chili to my recipe book!
5.0,GOOD STUFF! I made it for dinner this weekend. My girlfriend and I loved it! I substituted about 12 oz of recently purchased &#34;Dynamite&#34; roasted chilies for the 8 oz of canned green chilies. We both like our chili with a tad of &#34;WHANG&#34; to it. The two of us finished off the leftovers the next day for lunch. I will definitely be making this again!!
5.0,Very good! I didn&#39;t have any of the spices but had a pack of white chicken chili seasoning and used it.  I also left out the green chilies since I have young children.  Because we have 6 people in our family I added 2 more cans of beans and more broth to stretch it further.  Still very good.  Gonna add this to  my regular winter recipes
5.0,Made this and everyone loved it. I didn&#39;t have the green chilies so I used a few red pepper flakes. Will definitely make this again.
5.0,"This is now &#34;my&#34; chili recipe.  It&#39;s a total knockout!  I use 1 can of northern beans, 1 can of garbanzo beans, and 1 can of sweet white corn.  My friends and family BEG for it."
5.0,This chili was amazing my family loved it. I definitely recommend trying it.
5.0,This was delicious!  Everyone in the family enjoyed it!  Definitely a keeper!
5.0,So good!  My husband and I really liked it!  Better than my other white chili recipe!
5.0,Would make again.  used approx 1/2 cup sour cream and a little under 1/2 cup for the whipping cream to make it thicker.  Simmering helps the liquid reduce.  Made corn bread to go with it.  YUM!
5.0,"Have made this several times, it&#39;s a big hit in our house!!"
5.0,We&#39;ve made this twice in the last two weeks. Yummy!!
5.0,"I absolutely love this recipe, it has fantastic flavor, and it&#39;s very appealing to look at! Two changes I made from the original recipe, is to use plain ground pork over sausage, and I add some cubed butternut squash. Also not bad if you happen to not have the tortellini (because you ran out of the store without grabbing it) to use some other type of pasta, like farfalle."
5.0,"Everyone in my family loves this soup, even the kids who are picky eaters. The first time I made this I only had ground turkey sausage on hand, so I used that. I also use all chicken broth instead of adding water."
5.0,This is one of our family favorites!
5.0,"Absolutely loved this!  My mom wouldn&#39;t eat it because of the pasta, but too bad for her!!  I made half the recipe since it was just myself to eat it.  Had it for lunch for a few days too, but that was okay!  I used hot pork sausage, but I like things hot!  Would definitely make again, especially during a winter storm.....nummy!!"
5.0,This was really really good... I love soups and I do 95% of all the cooking in the house.. My wife only realy will eat soups in the winter( to me that&#39;s just crazy.. Soups are awesome) wife and both kids couldn&#39;t get enough( with the kids both 16 arguing about how to split the last bowls worth..    The changes and additions I made are for the proteins I used 4 boneless chicken thighs diced and browned in pot. 2 chicken sausage links with sun dried tomatoes browned in skillet then sliced.. For the water I used more chicken broth.. I also added 2 large carrots sliced and a mid to small zucchini halfed   length ways and sliced . I half the amount of garlic and added salted to taste (prob about 1/2 teaspoon) and I added the sausage at the same time as the tortellini
5.0,"This is my go to soup when asked to bring soup to a function.  It&#39;s always a hit and I&#39;m asked for the recipe.  The only change I made was to use a pound of italian sausage or hot italian, depending on where it&#39;s going.  Thanks for sharing I love this soup!!"
5.0,This soup was amazing! I thought since it had limited ingredients and was a quick soup it would lack in flavor but that was not the case. The only thing I did differently was use spicy bulk sausage. This one is a keeper.
5.0,My whole family loved this soup! Such delicious flavor!  I substituted a large can of tomato soup for the diced tomatoes and used ground sweet Italian sausage in place of the turkey sausage.   I will definitely make this again for my family.
5.0,"I do not post many reviews, but have taken TOH magazine since it started an I am a big fan. I did want to post this soup recipe because it is delicious ! When I make a recipe for the 1st time I usually follow it as I did this one, with the exception of I used all broth an no water, which was 3 cans. I could not find turkey links this time so I used Johnsonville Chicken Garlic links an just sliced them up an browned them with the onion. I thought this would taste bland without adding other seasonings but, I was wrong. It tasted great! Thank you Tracy for this gem!"
5.0,I loved this soup soon as I tried it at a lunch I went to.  So I tried it at home and my husband absolutely loved it too.  It&#39;s now my go to soup and I just change it up by using different meats such as Johnsonville brats sliced then cooked or taken out of the casings &amp; cooked and I use chicken breasts too.
5.0,I usually twerk a recipe to my own taste. This was perfect as is. It will be a staple recipe in our house. Thank you!
5.0,"One of our favorites just as is, but being a tweaker I added a can of great northern beans....YUM!!!"
5.0,"Absolutely love this and so easy to make! My grocery store only had hot turkey sausage, so I opted instead for the precooked Jimmie Dean sausage crumbles. The textures and flavors just go together so well!"
5.0,"We make this almost weekly in our house; we love to use it for lunches for the week. I try to always have the ingredients on hand, but the best thing about this recipe is that you can easily alter it, and it&#39;s still good. We use Wegman&#39;s chicken sausage in various flavors (usually mild italian and sundried tomato and basil), and if I don&#39;t have fresh garlic, garlic powder works fine. I also use frozen cut leaf spinach instead of fresh. It always turns out great, even when I double the recipe!"
5.0,i made this for a dinner party  and served it in sip &#39;n style bowls I ordered on amazon.It was perfect.
5.0,"I&#39;ve made this soup several times, it is amazing. So much flavor. I only make one change, i use hot Italian sausage."
5.0,Fantastic recipe. I made it and the family loved it. It&#39;s a regular on the menu now.
5.0,I&#39;ve made this soup several times as well but with hot Italian sausage.  Great flavor and so easy to make.  It is amazing!  Definitely a keeper!!
5.0,"This is a full-bodied soup that makes a great meal, with a side of crusty bread. I used the hot Italian turkey sausage because we like spicy food. There was mild, not overpowering heat. The preparation was quick and easy. The result is a delicious homemade soup."
5.0,I used hot italian sausage and added half a cup of heavy cream at the end and it was fantastic. Got rave reviews from my family.
5.0,"Super quick, easy, and delicious! I will definitely make this again. (Even my picky 6-year old liked it!)"
5.0,"This is definitely a family favorite.  I&#39;ve been making it for over a year, but I, too, have made a few minor changes to it.  I use a one-pound package of regular pork sausage instead of the turkey sausage links.  Then, to make up for the lack of Italian flavor, I added 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning.  And to save time, I also threw in a few handfuls of frozen spinach instead of dealing with fresh spinach.  Like most soups, it gets even better after it sits overnight--assuming that it lasts that long!"
5.0,"I too made my own adjustments. I had cooked 1/2 chicken breast in crock , then used frozen spinach. So darn good &amp; easy!!"
5.0,Family favourite.  I use 5c prepared chicken broth in place of the canned broth and water and spicy Italian sausage (3 or 4 links removed from casing and crumbled)
5.0,"Easy and filling, served with garlic/cheese sticks.  Only change I made was to use turkey meat balls.  Will definitely make again."
5.0,A friend recommended this recipe.  Made the soup for the first time.  My husband  is asking for it again within a few days.  Loved it!
5.0,Loved this! I used spicy turkey sausage which was really good in this. Then just added some Italian seasoning.  Quick and easy too!
5.0,"I absolutely love this soup! Like many, I made a couple of changes to the recipe. I used plain ground pork in place of the sausage, and often like to add some cubed butternut squash. It&#39;s great!Edit: I have no idea why I made two posts."
5.0,"I scrolled past this recipe on the TOH site and saw all the great reviews. Decided to try and WOW! Wonderful flavor, easy to throw together and a satisfying meal. We used a &#34;hot&#34; turkey sausage and loved the kick. I can see this being a regular recipe in our fall/winter lineup."
5.0,loved it - used hot italian sausage.
5.0,I love this soup!!!  I cook the tortellini before adding it to the soup at the end.
5.0,"A favorite for sure.  Made it 3 times so far, used tomatoes out of my garden but otherwise followed the recipe.  Delicious!"
5.0,Perfect! There is a reason so many people have given this recipe 5 stars.
5.0,Fantastic satisfying weeknight meal.  I made it vegetarian using vegetable broth and Tofurkey sun dried tomato and basil Italian &#34;sausage&#34;.  Delicious!
5.0,Great for  the holidays
5.0,"Husband and I loved this.  I used Johnsonville Hot&#39;n Spicy Bratwurst (19 oz), forgot the water and chose not to use the Parmesan cheese.  It was absolutely delicious and filling with just the right amount of kick...keeps you coming back for more."
5.0,"Made a huge pot of this soup for Christmas Bunco with the girls.  At someone&#39;s suggestion, I cooked it a day ahead to let the flavors blend overnight.  I used Italian sausage (like hamburger) from the meat department.  I too omitted the water and added extra chicken broth.  I&#39;m not  fan of spinach so I used escarole lettuce instead.  It   turned  bright green and with the ITALIAN tomatoes I used, the soup had colors of red and green and really looked festive.  Oh and I used whole wheat tortellini.  I served it with the Onion Swiss Cheese Bread Ring and that heavenly Marinated Olive and Cheese Ring.  Everyone raved about the meal!  We had Christmas cookies for dessert."
5.0,I loved this soup! Great flavor combination and only gets better the next day.  The addition of sausage makes it a hearty meal all by itself. Grate some fresh Parmesan over the top and it is heaven. Would definitely make this one again.
5.0,Super easy and delicious! My daughter keep asking me to make this one again :D
5.0,"I made this soup last night and it was so amazing I am sharing it with everyone I know. I made a few changes due to lack of reading the recipe fully. I used pork Italian sausage instead of turkey and let it brown really well. I omitted both peppers, red pepper because my little tongue doesn&#39;t do well with spice and black because I failed to see it when I read the recipe. I used dried basil because my market was out of fresh. Other than that I made it exactly as the recipe reads, even with the water, which did not dilute the flavor at all. I will make this over and over again, I cannot express how good it was."
5.0,"On this icy cold Michigan winter day this hot soup was AWESOME! I used Italian chicken sausage cut into chucks, in addition to the actual recipe I added some fresh sliced mushrooms, fresh sugar snap peas that were in the fridge and about a tablespoon of chicken soup base.   I posted a picture of my masterpiece online, it looked fabulous.  I only wish some of my friends were closer so they could have tasted the yummyiness too."
5.0,"I made this recipe and everyone raved over it!! It was absolutely delicious. Everyone wanted recipe. That&#39;s how you really know if they like it or are just being nice. My daughter in-law loved it and she hates soup!  I, however,  went with the original version and used spicy italian sausage rather than turkey sausage  or ground  turkey, but I&#39;m sure they would also be fine."
5.0,"I sauteed shredded kale with no stems with the onion and added carrots, add garlic after. I generally find adding garlic and other potentially harsher arromatics later so they don&#39;t burn is the right call. I then added a teaspoon of sweet paprika, a bay leaf, and two thyme sprigs right before the broth and tomatoes (replace water with all broth). Turned out fantastic. For the finer palate, a cup of gruyere added really is awesome in lieu of parmesan. Should note I doubled the recipe as well so all measures reflect that. Dankness."
5.0,5  stars!!!Love the flavor! I used garlic with olive oil diced tomatoes and chicken stock instead of water.
5.0,"This soup was awesome! Great flavor and it took me 30 minutes to make and tasted like it simmered for three hours. I used only 1 cup of water (more chicken broth), used diced tomatoes with oregano and onion, and fat-free/reduced sodium chicken broth to reduce the calories further. I also had frozen tortellini so I used those as I think they hold up better than fresh."
5.0,My family loved this!
5.0,This was fabulous!
5.0,Excellent! I like to use kale instead of spinach sometimes.
5.0,One of our favorite soups!  So good!
5.0,"This is so easy and tasty, actually better the next day."
5.0,We love this soup. Very filling and delicious.
5.0,"Very good...But forget the turkey sausage and use real pork.. I also add a little more tortellini.  Just my preference...And I used stewed tomatoes in place of diced...Other than that, excellent..."
5.0,"Outstanding flavour! My whole family loved this soup. They told me it&#39;s a &#39;keeper&#39;, which in my family means it becomes part of our regular rotation of meals."
5.0,I made this soup yesterday and LOVED it!  It was really quick and easy to make.  I am sitting at work wishing I would have brought some for lunch.
5.0,Outstanding!!   need I say more......
5.0,VERY GOOD!!!
5.0,"My husband said this is his new favorite! I used two 32 oz cartons of chicken broth and omitted the water, Johnsonville mild Italian sausage, frozen spinach thawed and squeezed dry, and diced tomatoes with Italian seasonings. Really nice flavor. Thanks for sharing  a great recipe!"
5.0,"Delish! Substitutions made.  Used sweet italian sausage, fresh chicken stock, chopped tomatoes w/basil, sweet Italian sausage tortellini, creole seasoning (instead of pepper).  Added spice and flavor!"
5.0,This is a family favorite!  I use spicy regular Italian Sausage.
5.0,Yum! Will make again.
5.0,This is the most excellent soup that you can make.  It is quick and easy.  Our family loves it.
5.0,"I made a few changes to this soup to accommodate what I had on hand. It was super easy and delicious! I&#39;m not a fan of sausage so I omitted that. I added sweet peppers to the onion. And used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. I also didn&#39;t have fresh spinach so I thawed some frozen spinach, squeezed it and crumbled that in. I would definitely make this again. The red pepper flakes gave it a hint of spice and the parmesan cheese on top was a nice finishing touch."
5.0,"This was very easy to make.  If you like it &#34;soupier&#34;, add a little more broth.  I made everything as is and the family wants me to cook it again!"
5.0,My husband loves this soup. I add more broth so that it is not so thick.
5.0,made with meat tortelli 2nd time  and was very good as well/ instead of sausage
5.0,"Easy &amp; yummy!  My husband LOVES this soup!  I&#39;ve changed it up on occasion by substituting fresh green beans for spinach (or add both), use pre-cooked thawed italian meatballs cut into quarters, or roasted cherry tomatoes to add."
5.0,Loved it
5.0,Best soup I&#39;ve ever had.
5.0,"This soup was amazing!  Even if you are not into this type of soup, it is a MUST try. I used red onion, spicy sausage instead of the turkey sausage;  chicken broth instead of water (added extra), and a carton of fresh Cherub cherry tomatoes  instead of a can of diced tomatoes.  Enjoy!"
5.0,The best soup ever!
5.0,"This is wonderful!!  Made a few changes based solely on  family preferences.  Halved the garlic, used all chicken broth, and 1/4 t. Dried basil, then very low simmer (covered) for 30  minutes.  My family likes tri color penne , so actually boiled that separately, and set up a &#34;soup bar&#34; where you could assemble this  any way you like.  Pasta,  spinach, ladle soup over , cheese.  A huge keeper.  Thank you!"
5.0,"Love this recipe! I did make a couple changes, I added carrots when cooking the onions, and I used canned tomatoes seasoned with garlic and onion ( included the juices) I also included a bag of frozen green beans before adding the spinach and tortellini. My husband does not care for soups generally,  however he LOVES this soup!!! Definitely a keeper!!!!"
5.0,"Absolutely fabulous.  This has been in my recipe box for some time.  Finally, got to try it tonight.  It was enjoyed by all.  Thanks so much for sharing this fabulous recipe."
5.0,Delicious!!! Used sweet basil sausage &amp; Italian seasoned tomatoes.
5.0,This recipe has become one of my Family Favorites!  It makes a great Meatless Monday dinner ... I just  omit the sausage and add a package of cream cheese (cut into cubes) 5 minutes before serving.  Allow the cream cheese to melt and stir into the soup for added richness.
5.0,this is one of my favorite soups now. used fresh tomatoes and spinach from farmers market when making it the first time and it was delicious. Tastes just as good maybe better second day
5.0,This was good.  I substituted what I had on hand. Used a box of frozen spinach and substituted  8 oz of a bagged tortellini.  Used a roasted diced tomato which had some additional seasoning.   My picky son liked it.  so I&#39;d say it was a hit..
5.0,Made this over the weekend and it was deicious!
5.0,"This soup is quick, easy, and delicious all in one!!! I&#39;ve made this many times and my fiance loves it!!!!!!"
5.0,I used hot sausage and added more sausage/pasta than it called for and it turned out GREAT!  My husband loved it and I love it!
5.0,"This is the best, easiest soup I&#39;ve ever made.  No changes are necessary."
5.0,Made it with hot Italian sausage.   Loved it!  It was very tasty and colorful.  Was as good or better than soups served in restaurants.
5.0,Great recipe! Fast and delicious.  My 6 year old loves it and he is a tough critic. Btw I used both sweet and spicy sausage.
5.0,Hot italian sausage is the way 2 go and the soup pot was empty. A definate keeper!
5.0,"No wonder this recipe is a contest winner. It was delicious - very flavorful - and hearty. I used a total of two 32 oz Swanson chicken broth boxes because I thought it needed more broth to match the tortellini and because of other reviewers saying the same thing... I was glad I did. I did not use the water because of what other reviewers said about replacing it with broth, which my bigger boxes of broth took care of. I skipped the can of diced tomatoes because I&#39;m not a fan but I can see how they would add to the soup for others. The recipe calls for turkey sausage but I used regular Italian sausage and it calls for 12 oz but I had 16 oz so I used the whole thing. For the  refrigerated tortellini, I used the tiny cheese raviolettis that Buitoni offers. I used fresh spinach from one of the 9 oz &#34;salad&#34; bags (probably used about 7 oz of it and didn&#39;t chop it up) and I did two tablespoons of the fresh basil because I love it. I used more than a dash of red pepper... did a couple of shakes. We did put shredded parmesan on top and I highly recommend. I served the soup with really good five grain bread and butter and, as I write this, I wish I was having the meal again tonight because it was AMAZING."
5.0,"Absolutely delicious!!  The parmesan cheese added while the soup is served adds to the flavor.  The only change I made was to add more chicken broth ...6-7 cups of broth and omitted the water.   Since the tortellini absorbs some of the liquid, not enough liquid is left for leftovers if more broth is not added at the start."
5.0,"Everyone LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this! Definitely a keeper!"
5.0,"Love it!  I made two pots of soup using this recipe yesterday for a family dinner.  One pot was exactly as written and it was wonderful, will definitely make again and again.  The other pot of soup was for vegetarians, so it was meatless; I used vegetable broth in place of the chicken broth and, for variety, butternut squash ravioli in place of the tortellini.  What was leftover went for  lunch today so it was very good also."
5.0,"My whole family enjoyed this recipe - I substituted spinach for mushrooms because that&#39;s what I had on hand, and I added a less water than is called for in the recipe.  This was a quick and easy weeknight meal!"
5.0,amazing soup
5.0,Every one in family absolutely loves it!
5.0,"I have made this soup several times and we enjoy it more each time! I use bulk Italian sausage instead which saves time. It is so easy to make and perfect on a cold night with crusty Italian bread!!! I also add mushrooms, and red and green peppers on top of everything it already calls for and it&#39;s always amazing!!!"
5.0,"This is the only soup my entire family (including kids age 7 &amp; 3) loves! I use a pound of ground turkey sausage and season it with a mixture I found at http://www.food.com/recipe/turkey-breakfast-sausage-patties-100408. I also use all chicken broth (no water), and I double the tortellini. Very filling, easy, and delicious!"
5.0,"Really enjoyed this soup, quick and easy to make too!  I used spicy sausages to give it some extra spice."
5.0,Everytime I serve this to guests they want the recipe!  I bet we have this once a month for dinner.  I use Italian style chopped tomatoes and it gives it even more flavor.  Great recipe.
5.0,Very filling soup. Great for a cold winter night. I used all chicken stock and eliminated the water. Also added chopped celery and carrots. I made mine in the crockpot and let it simmer while at work. Just cooked the tortellini  and added it and the basil  and spinach before serving. It tastes great the next day.
5.0,"Love Love loved it! Did I mention that I loved it.  I had been looking for a soup that wasn&#39;t so full of salt, healthy YET delicious!  This was wonderful, tasty, hearty and VERY fulfilling.  The only thing  I did differently was add stewed tomatoes instead of diced.  I like the chunky tomatoes, plus it adds more veggies to your meal.  Its cold here now so I am excited to get off and head to the grocery store so that I can make a pot tonight! Yummy!  p.s. if you sprinkle a little Parmesan shredded cheese on top its gives it an even better flavor!"
5.0,"A really awesome soup. I love how I can get different flavors from every spoonful. I made it with regular sausage because I couldn&#39;t find turkey sausage nor did I care for it that much. Came out wonderful, but I was a little spicy."
5.0,"Fabulous!  (I have meat-eaters in the family, so I cooked the hot Italian turkey sausage with a pound of ground turkey. When I make this again, I&#39;ll add some bite-sized chicken to the turkey as well.  I used crushed Italian tomatoes instead of the diced variety.  Next time I will also add the tortellini to each bowl because the leftovers soaked up too much of the liquid.)  You gotta try this recipe!"
5.0,"Absolutely Delicious!   Reading all the reviews, I have to say Ditto.  Excellent, fantastic, wonderful, wouldn&#39;t change a thing.  I did chop my chicken that was par-cooked instead of cubing it, however, and cooked in Crock Pot - 45 minutes on High, then about 3 hours on Low.  My 11-year-old is picky and didn&#39;t seem thrilled about white chili.  He Now says it&#39;s the best thing in the world and he could eat it every night.  It went great with tortilla chips, too!"
5.0,"For me, a published recipe is a guideline rather than an absolute. I adjusted this recipe slightly, based on the ingredients I had on hand.  I added 1/2 t. poultry seasoning (in place of Oregano). Used minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  I only had one can of chopped green chilies, so added a cup of chopped red, yellow and orange bell pepper. We like heat, so I used 1T of cayenne, and we added sliced jalape?o peppers and shredded cheese on top, forgoing the sour cream.  I used 2 c. of whole milk instead of heavy whipping cream, and 2 T corn starch as a thickener.  There are so many ways to make white chili, that as long as you keep it white and use the right amount of herbs and seasoning, based on the preferences of those you are feeding, you&#39;ve got a hit every time.  Our side was a handful of gluten free corn chips, but sweet cornbread would be perfect too."
5.0,"Sunshinebakerpa said:  &#34;I made it without the green chilies, but found it was missing something. I used a little less sour cream and heavy cream like the others had suggested to make it thicker.&#34;So you made your own chili recipe, omitted chilis and thought it was missing something.  Then you rated this recipe 3/5.   I hope you aren&#39;t a registered voter."
5.0,Wonderful recipe!   LOVED  your response to &#39;&#39;Sunshinebakerpa&#39;&#39;  mdredmond!!!  Made my day..thanks!
5.0,"my whole family enjoyed this decadent chili, that is more like a soup.  so easy to make."
5.0,I made it exactly as indicated and it was fantastic. I wanted to lick the bowl.  This recipe is a keeper!
5.0,"Really good and quick!  I think sweet corn would be good in it too, firstof6ps!"
5.0,This was SO GOOD!!!  Super easy to make.  Only thing I did different was I added fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.
5.0,I used half &amp; half instead of whipping cream.  Everyone enjoyed it and had seconds.
5.0,"This is a great recipe, I did only put half the sour cream in and added no cream. Turned out sooo yummy!"
5.0,"This is a great recipe, I did only put half the sour cream in and added no cream. Turned out sooo yummy!"
5.0,This chili is off the charts good!  Everyone in my family raved about it.  I did use fresh minced garlic and added more chicken and beans for a bigger crowd.  This is definitely going in my favorite recipes box.
5.0,I love this and so did my family. !!!!
5.0,"My husband and I made this recipe together...It was amazing!!! Thank you for the post, I will definitely be making this recipe again!!! :)"
5.0,"My family LOVES this! My sister in law even wanted the recipe. Its a quick, easy, family pleasing meal!"
5.0,"I doubled this recipe, used tri-colored tortellinis and ground turkey instead of sausage. To add some spicy flavor I used one can of diced tomatoes and one can of diced tomatoes w/chiles.  I also added a can of white beans (drained/rinsed).  This is such a hearty, delicious soup!"
5.0,"This is super easy to make, ready in no time and delicious.  Everyone I&#39;ve ever served it to has loved it.  Paired with some crusty bread, this is a mega-pleasing lunch or dinner!"
5.0,"I only edited one major thing in this recipe, and that was the onions. My fiance doesn&#39;t like regular onions but will eat green onions if I put them in soup, so I used a stalk of green onions chopped in exchange for an onion. I also nearly tripled the amount of tortellini, and I used three cans of chicken broth instead of the one can chicken broth + water. I ended up buying a 16 ounce package of Italian Sausage instead of of taking a part 3 4-ounce sausages. So, other than changing the amount I put in of certain ingredients, lol, I nearly followed the recipe, and it was fantastic! I&#39;ll be keeping this recipe for years to come!"
5.0,"This is one of the easiest recipes I&#39;ve ever made. But instead of using Turkey sausage, I used Johnsonville Three Cheese Italian Style Chicken Sausages."
5.0,This recipe was marvelous.  Even my vegetable shy daughter ate it- spinach and all!  We&#39;re definitely making this one again.
5.0,This was so good.   Even my picky family loved it and asked for seconds.   I used a large chicken broth and decreased the water to only a cup.  Next time I will omit the water and use more broth
5.0,The best soup ever. I made it for a family gathering and everyone raved about it.  I added a can of Rotel to zip it up a bit!
5.0,This recipe is so easy and fast. My husband has asked for it several times!
5.0,Great recipe.  I followed it exactly and my family said they would like it often.
5.0,Amazing - one of the best soups I&#39;ve ever made!
5.0,I made this soup substituting vegetarian sausage for the italian sausage and vegetable broth for the chicken broth and the vegetarians and meat lovers at my house all loved it.
5.0,"This recipe is truly excellent. But I suggest a couple alterations for finicky eaters. I used CRUSHED tomatoes instead of diced tomatoes, it gives the broth a wonderful red color, plus you get the flavor of tomatoes without the texture. Second, I add about 3 medium petitley diced carrots and saute them with the onions and sausage. You get an extra veggie serving in there and it adds a pop of color, almost too pretty to eat! It&#39;s a real hit with everyone, I&#39;ve started tripling the recipe and freezing it so I always have some on hand."
5.0,Me and my family love this soup. I have made it at least every other week since I found the recipe.
5.0,"I added a tsp of salt, and substituted the crushed red pepper flakes for 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper because that what was in the pantry!  Every delicious..I just ate 3  bowls!!"
5.0,"So yummy! Even my mom, who swore she&#39;d never like italian sausage, liked this soup."
5.0,Didn&#39;t have spinach on hand so I used some green peppers. We loved it!
5.0,"I just made this tonight. It was a hit! Great taste, easy and healthy!"
5.0,Very yummy!  Doubled this and used home canned tomatoes and thawed swiss chard instead of spinach.  Next day the tortellini&#39;s started falling apart and absorbed a lot of the liquid still very tasty but better the first day.
5.0,"I have been looking for a good tasting &amp; easy restaurant quality tortellini soup-this recipe is a keeper.  I doubled it, used frozen tortellini &amp; frozen spinach.  I also used hot turkey sausage and homemade chicken stock.  Very filling, but also light, tasty, no added salt and good for you.  I love the ease that this comes together-one pot, chop an onion &amp; garlic and toss everything else in.  It was finished so quickly too..a little parmesan adds salt and creaminess that makes it just perfect.  Yummo."
5.0,This was absolutely wonderful....I just substituted turkey for the turkey sausage...I hate sausage..WONDERFUL!
5.0,I substituted Italian Pork Sausage &amp; Frozen Tortellini.  Easy to make and really yummy!!
5.0,Wow this is good! We like lots of flavor and this has it. Very filling w/some crusty garlic bread. Don&#39;t skimp on the garlic.
5.0,Quick and easy meal on a cold night. Wonderful flavor along with a loaf of hot baked bread makes for a complete comfort meal. A favorite recipe now.
5.0,I doubled the amount of tortellini to make it thicker and it was still amazing:)
5.0,"Firsttime to rate a recipe after many years of enjoying Taste of Home, Simple and delcious and Healthy Cooking!  This is awesome!  My Italian husband wasn&#39;t sure with the addition of spinach, but loved it and rated as a &#34;keeper&#34;"

5.0,I just made this soup for dinner and it was very good! Was fast and easy to make. I didn&#39;t use the whole bag of spinach because my family just prefers a little less. :)

5.0,"This family favorite is requested often.  I usually follow the recipe as written, but have substituted bulk sausage, frozen tortellini or frozen spinach based on what I have on hand"
5.0,"Heck yes, I would make this again! This soup is absolutely delicious...may have just become the favorite."
5.0,"Simple, fast, tasty. Add some crusty french bread and you have a great meal. I used frozen tortellini and it didn&#39;t seem to make any difference. I also used a can of diced Italian tomatoes instead of regular diced tomatoes and it gave the soup a little more flavor. Another keeper recipe!"
5.0,"This soup is delicious and easy to make.  I,ve made it several times and everyone loves it.  You can substitute the tortellini with Bowtie pasta and it&#39;s still fabulous!  This recipe ia a keeper!"
5.0,This was very good. It tasted even better to me heated up the next day for lunch. definitly making this again.
5.0,"I make this all the time, light, healthy and delicious!"
5.0,"Awesome!  We used 4 regular italian sausage links, rather than the 3 italian turkey sausage links suggested.  Also, I kept the casings on the sausage - much easier."
5.0,"added left over chicken, cilantro, celery and sundried tomatoes - DELICIOUS... no one knew they were eating leftovers.  I kept the sausages also but used chicken/apple sausages."
5.0,"My mom gave me this recipe a few years ago, she used zucchini instead of spinach. I&#39;ve used either one, or green beans! Delcious!"
5.0,I made this recipe as written and it was delicious!!!  My husband loved it too and it will definitely be a repeat in my house.
5.0,Awesome! I made this for the first time when I got my magazine in the mail...and make it probably once a month through the fall and winter. Everyone that tastes it raves! Simple and very delicious.
5.0,Great flavor and easy to make. I didn&#39;t have any Italian sausage so I used country sausage and added Italian seasoning and some fennel. Otherwise I pretty much made it as written and served it with small sandwiches. Great meal for the Fall.
5.0,I have now made this yummy soup several times. My family and coworkers all agree it&#39;s a &#34;keeper!&#34;
5.0,I tried this soup for the first time last week. It was delicious. I used a seeded jalapino pepper in place of pepper flakes as I had some from my garden. I also just used bulk Italian sausage. I have already shared this recipe with my daughters.
5.0,"Doubled this recipe and brought to work, should have tripled..gone in a flash! Everyone really enjoyed. Great soup and hearty, too!  Yum!"
5.0,The best soup I have ever tasted!!!
5.0,"This got top ratings from my family, particularly my husband.  I didn&#39;t have any spinach so I used red pepper."
5.0,"Such a easy, quick, delicious soup. Didn&#39;t have any tortellini, so I used cheese ravioli. My husband loved it!"
5.0,Very good soup. Not a huge sausage fan. Tastes best the first day. More sausagey aroma after flavors meld.
5.0,"This has become a family favorite!  Easy, quick and delicious!"
5.0,Everytime I make this recipe for friends and co-workers I am asked for the recipe.  This recipe rates 6 GOLD STARS!!!!
5.0,"Tasted delicious , looked beautiful, and was easy to make. The perfect recipe!"
5.0,"Everyone ate it and that is a big deal in my house. Usually, half will like, half won&#39;t (3 children, 5 adults). Didn&#39;t have tortellini or ravioli, so made due with rotini pasta. Also, omitted red pepper flakes cuz of the kids. Doubled the recipe of course and served with shredded mozarella (didn&#39;t have parm). Added garlic bread and viola! Yummy for all!"
5.0,"Loved the soup,! I will cut back on the water next time, just for more flavor. I added sliced fresh mushrooms to mine. I may try to add pasta next time instead of the tortellini jut to see how it taste ....."
5.0,"My husband and I loved this very much, though I admit to making a few changes to suit our tastes.I doubled the recipe for a bigger batch and used 10 links of Johnsonville spicy italian pork sausage (my man likes meat) instead of 6 turkey sausage links. I sliced the sausage into pieces and added the garlic with the onions and meat from the start instead of waiting. I added the dried basil, black pepper, and red pepper flakes when I added the broth and tomatoes (I did not add any water) so it would cook longer in the soup and pull more flavors out. (I used more seasoning than recipe called for and used 2 heaping tsps of dried basil, 1 tsp of black pepper, and added 3/4 tsp red pepper to suit our need for heat)I also added 3 tbs of chicken bouillon and 1 heaping tsp of onion powder because we like our flavors stronger and the tomatoes were a bit too dominant. The rest I just followed the recipe and voila! Going to make this over and over again. :)"
5.0,I forgot to mention that I used 2- 28 oz cans of Hunt&#39;s diced tomatoes for my double batch.
5.0,This is my husband&#39;s favorite soup.
5.0,"This is the BEST soup!  For the italian sausage, I use one half Johnsonville Italian Hot and one half Johnsonville Italian Sweet.  It&#39;s a nice blend and gives the soup a little bite.  I also add sliced fresh mushrooms. Took it to a soup and sandwich at church and received several requests for the recipe.  Heidi Launer, Alamogordo, NM"
5.0,"Made this for guinea pig guests. Excellent, easy and quick. This is going in the permanent file."
5.0,"I actually prepared this recipe with a 28 ounce can of Ro-Tel Diced Tomatoes &amp; Green Chilies, a 32oz. carton of Beef Broth and a 19 oz. bag of frozen Cheese Totellini,defrosted. I added a dash of Tabasco instead of the red pepper flakes and used the sweet Turkey links as well. I am one of those cooks who believes in improvising with ingredients on hand and recipes always seems turned out well for me. Be Creative!"
5.0,"Everyone enjoyed the soup along with slices of Garlic Bread.  I used 1 lb. of ground Italian Pork Sausage instead of links.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as is.  Very, Very, Good!"
5.0,I love this recipe!!! I have used ground beef or regular Italian sausage.
5.0,This soup is fantastic!!   Major raves reviews and seconds by all made this pot disappear quickly.
5.0,"I made this last night and doubled the recipe, hoping to have leftovers.  No such luck!  My family loved this soup and said it&#39;s a keeper!"
5.0,My husband and I both agree this was delicious.  Next time I will make a double batch so I can share it with family.   Thank you  MMB
5.0,"This is the first time, I&#39;ve written a review...but it is also the first time I&#39;ve felt compelled to!  This is very tasty, for the amount of time and effort that is put into making the recipe.  Very easy to make!!!I don&#39;t even like spinach...but this soup is soooo good!!I used sausage mince, in place of the Italian turkey sausage links, as this is what I had on hand.This was excellent and I will definitely be making this again!!    Well done!"
5.0,This recipe is so simple and absolutely deliciouos. My family loved it. I will definitely be adding it to my regular recipe rotation.
5.0,I LOVE this recipe! To add a little flair to it by adding 4oz of fat free cream cheese and a cap full of Mrs. Dash HOT seasoning
5.0,"This soup is delicious! I will definitely make it again. I used loose hot, italian sausage that was surprisingly lean, because my husband loves spicy food, and I left out the pepper flakes. Next time I will try it with a different sausage just for a change, but this recipe is a keeper!"
5.0,I made 3 different soups for Super Bowl and this was the favority by far!!  Husband said it was the best soup he ever had!
5.0,Absolutely fabulous! I used &#34;hot&#34; turkey sausage - I loved the pep this soup had.
5.0,This was so good and healthy and easy.  It was a little spicy so I left out the papper &amp; red pepper and used a little less turkey Italian sausage.  The flavor was intense and the parmesan was a nice added touch. I will surely make this again.
5.0,The flavor of this is incredible for such few and simple ingredients. I will make this many times. I used fresh basil and my local grocery only had sweet italian turkey so I was sure to give it a few shakes of red pepper flakes. The only thing I changed was I omitted the water. We like ours a little thicker and I like to avoid the carbs in the crackers that I typically use for that purpose. Two thumbs up. Oh and my eight yr old ate 3 bowls so your kids will like it too. :)
5.0,"This soup is a snap to make, and it received heaps of praise from my mother-in-law when I made it for her! The soup is full of scrumptious flavors with just the right amount of heat."
5.0,This soup is very delicious and very low fat and low calorie.
5.0,This is one of the best soup recipes I have.  Simple to make and packed full of flavor.
5.0,This recipe was so quick to fix and really delicious.  My family said it&#39;s a keeper.
5.0,This is a great soup to impress.  It is very easy and so delicious.  Great with a side of crusty bread.  Be sure to just barely cook the tortellini as they can overcook very quickly.
5.0,"What a great recipe. I made one with lime, one with strawberry, and an orange one for a picnic. Your recipe is fantastic and so very versatile. :)"
5.0,"I have made this pie multiple times in the past. We loved it. So easy, and light, also."
5.0,Thus pie is so yummy
5.0,"<p>Great recipe.I used pork Italian sausage,frozen spinach and frozen tortellini because that is what I had on hand and it worked just as well.I definitely will  keep making this</p>"
5.0,"This recipe was enjoyed even by my picky hubby!  I added a can of cannellini beans, rinsed and drained, and it was terrific."
5.0,Amazing flavor for a quick soup.
5.0,I didn&#39;t change anything except that I buy bulk Italian sausage (it&#39;s cheaper than links) and it has become my family&#39;s absolutely favorite soup.  I love it because I can make it after work and know it will be a hit. I&#39;ve also brought it to friends who need a meal.  Great recipe!
5.0,"Wow... so easy, so flavorful.  It&#39;s on my list to repeat soon.Omitted the pepper flakes and used hot Italian sausage instead, like a couple of other posters did."
5.0,This is one of our favorite soups!  My husband and I fight over the leftovers and the kids love the tortellini and they even eat some of the spinach--I love that it is good for us too!
5.0,"I used some bulk pork sausage that I had on hand, but I think I will try it with some bulk turkey Italian seasoned sausage to get the benefit of the lower calories. We really enjoyed the soup, and yes, I&#39;ll make it again! I served it with my home made Artisan bread with rosemary seasoning. Yum!"
5.0,It really hit the spot !
5.0,This is the best white chili. I double the recipe so we can enjoy leftovers. Thank you for a real keeper.
5.0,This chili was very flavorful and easy to make...freezes well!
5.0,Made just as recipe read except I only had 1% milk. All it needed was a pan of cornbread. Delicious!
5.0,Fantastic taste!  It is more like a soup than a chili.  I didn&#39;t read the directions carefully &amp; added the sour cream &amp; heavy cream at the same time as everything else - still turned out perfect!  The only changes I made was I used leftover roasted chicken &amp; fresh green pepper instead of canned.
5.0,"&#34;Great flavor and texture! though i must agree with some of the other reviews, its closer to a chowder than a chili. I added 1 cup of mozzerella cheese when i added the cream and  let it simmer about 10min. more. It thickened it and rounded out all the flavors. Great dish. I&#39;ll be making it again.&#34;"
5.0,I&#39;ve made this chili several times.  Everyone who has tried it absolutely loves it.  It&#39;s a huge winner for me.
5.0,"I made this chili for the first time last year at a chili cookoff at work.  We were doing a fundraiser for the North Texas Food Bank.  I didn&#39;t win, but I had SEVERAL people ask for the recipe.  They loved it!!!  It was devoured in minutes.Well, I made it again last night and entered it in the chili cookoff again today.  Well.........There were 18 entries and I won 3rd place.  Again. had many tell me how they loved it and asked for the recipe.I love this chili but I do have one secret that I cannot share!!!"
5.0,I haven&#39;t tried this recipe but feel I can give it a five star rating because I have a very similar recipe - which everyone enjoys.  The only difference is that I use 2 TBSP of fresh cilantro in place of the oregano - and 1 1/2 cups of shredded Monterey Jack in place of the whipping cream - and cut the sour cream to 1/2 cup.   I also cut back the pepper and cayenne pepper because my family doesn&#39;t like foods too &#34;hot&#34;...
5.0,wonderful!!!
5.0,.
5.0,I made this last night and it was amazing!  Both my husband and I loved it.  I did not have sour cream on hand so I just added extra heavy cream and it was great.  This will now be in my fall/winter &#34;go to&#34;meals.  It really was a quick meal prep too.
5.0,This was delicious.  The only changes I made was reducing the amount of sour cream and adding an extra can of northern beans.
5.0,This recipe is amazing. I will definitely be making again. :)
5.0,"Terrific! Used this for a dinner party, and everyone walked away with the recipe. Didn&#39;t change anything about the recipe."
5.0,whoops...I forgot to rate the recipe!:)
5.0,OMG this is so good. One of the best key lime pies I&#39;ve ever made super easy only took 10 minutes. And so versatile.  You could use numerous jello and yogurt flavors
5.0,"Excellent light key lime pie.  Easy and quick to make.  Want to try other flavors such as raspberry which someone suggested, maybe with a chocolate crumb crust and arranging some fresh raspberries on top."
5.0,This was very good. Both my daughter and husband loved it. I did use regular lime gelatin because I couldn&#39;t find sugar free and I used regular whipped topping. Very easy to make.
5.0,"This is a very good and easy pie!! I have also substituted strawberry jello, and yogurt and some sliced fresh strawberries for another yummy pie!"
5.0,"While this isn’t a traditional key lime pie, it’s still a good pie. If you are looking for something light and slightly sweet, this is it. I’ve also varied the flavors and made peach, and strawberry. Really good, and always gobbled up!"
5.0,"I have made this, with no changes many times, and it never lasts long!  I also use this recipe, but use strawberry jello, strawberry yogurt,  and if I have them on hand, fresh strawberries, sliced. Both are great for those warm summer days!"
5.0,"Great recipe!  I have made this pie twice.  The first time, I made as key lime and the second time, I used strawberry gelatin and strawberry yogurt and they were both delicious!  Our guests really enjoyed these pies.  I am thinking of trying orange next!  So quick and easy :)"
5.0,I added juice from 1/4 of a large lime at the end and folded that in as well. Best key lime pie ever!
5.0,This pie is super easy! You can also change up the flavor just by changing the Yogurt
5.0,"Love this easy, flavorful, summer recipe! If you are a key lime pie snob, it’s obvious from the ingredients that it is not going to be “true “ key lime pie; however, call it creamy lime flavored pie! Either way, mine came out delicious and it is great to serve on a warm summer evening. I used Chabani key lime flavored yogurt, just because I love the flavor of this yogurt by itself! Stick it in the freezer for about an hour before serving, and it’s like eating an ice cream pie! Yummy!"
5.0,Love this pie. It tastes great and only takes 10 minutes to make. Sometimes I just make the filling and sprinkle crushed graham crackers over it.
5.0,I am diabetic and love this pie I also make it with sugar free orange Jello and orange yougart makes a wonderful orange cream pie
5.0,This is a delicious pie.  I was first introduced to it at a Weight Watcher meeting.  It&#39;s a treat for those avoiding sugar.
5.0,This recipe is for me. I followed the directions to the letter and it was fabulous. I made a low cholesterol graham cracker crust without butter to go with it. We put one of the pies in the freezer and it was a lovely frozen desert.
5.0,"This is an easy, wonderful, light dessert! I have made key lime, raspberry, and strawberry so far and plan to try more different flavors! I used regular gelatin and low-fat greek yogurt and light whipped topping. I didn&#39;t add all the whipped topping to the pie so I could put it on the pie along with fresh fruit when I served it. DELICIOUS!"
5.0,"This is a wonderfully easy, tasty &amp; healthy dessert! My only comment is that the amount of gelatin is incorrect -- since it says &#34;one packet&#34;, I used the smallest size, which is 3.0 oz., Not 0.3 oz. -- just a typo when it was posted, I&#39;m sure.  I used the full 3 Oz. packet and it came out fine :)"
5.0,"This has been a favorite in my household. I use 12 oz (1 &amp; 1/2 bars) of cream cheese instead of the yogurt (not a fan), and use an additional 4 oz of cool whip on top. I use various Jello flavors. It is especially good with strawberry Jello and 1cup frozen sliced strawberries mixed in the filling. I also use the larger 9oz graham cracker crust to fit it all in. Love how easy this is. I always get compliments when serving to others. They can&#39;t believe how easy it is to make!"
5.0,"Yummy and Light. I have been making various flavors with this recipe for years. We used to go camping and I would take the ingredients, then make this to share with our campground friends and it was always a hit."
5.0,"We really liked this recipe and the only change I made was adding 3rd can of beans (after reading the other reviews). Next time I make this chili I will decrease the amount of sour cream, and I will keep the pan on the stove after adding the sour cream &amp; heavy whipping cream - otherwise it cools the dish to lukewarm. This is a unique and flavorful meal."
5.0,"Very good!  Will make again. I added more beans, just my personal preference."
5.0,"Best White Chili Recipe in Town,  I&#39;ve been making this for 20 or so years.  I do not take it anywhere where I don&#39;t get asked for the recipe.  Also, if you do like it a little spicier you can buy &#34;hot&#34; chopped green chilies (NOT jalapenos) instead of the regular mild ones."
5.0,This White Chilli was Really good just seasoned very well!  I was low on Great White bean so Made with Half Black eyed peas and Half Great white from Dried Beans.   Cook the Beans first...   Will be making this again.  Yummy wow
5.0,Can you make this without the beans?
5.0,Very Good!!!  Cooked my own beans and used jalape?o ground pepper instead of cayenne pepper.  Delicious!
5.0,Y family loved this!
5.0,"I made this in the crock pot! changes i made: two frozen chicken breasts in crock pot...sauteed onion and minced garlic, doubled the broth and never added the heavy cream or sour cream...cooked on low for 8 hours.  it turned out great!"
5.0,This is a wonderful recipe and simple to make! All the ingredients blend well together and it is a great alternative to regular chili. It is also super tasty the next day and reheats well. Thanks!
5.0,"Great recipe 2nd time making it. However it comes out like a soup. I added wondra flour to achieve a thicker chili consistency, Love it!!! this one is in my recipe collection, Thank you!!!! I did make this recipe again on Nov. 11, 2016 even when I added a extra can of beans and mashed them prior to adding, I still needed to thicken with flour for more of a chili consistency however still an awesome recipe!!"
5.0,"We LOVE this chili recipe! I always have to double it, so we can have leftovers"
5.0,"I used one less can of green chilies, Glory seasoned northern beans, and omitted the salt. Very good, the Glory brand beans added much needed flavor.  Frittos on top to add a little crunch and salt. Yummy!"
5.0,??
5.0,I have made this chili recipe several times and it never fails to impress.  My only change is omitting the cayenne pepper.  Great recipe.
5.0,"YUMMY- I made two pie&#39;s ,so simply and so  good. I&#39;m giving the other one to my sister in law for her family for Easter. Thank You, Lee-Ann Treacher"
5.0,"This recipe is so quick , easy &amp; good.I have tried many flavor variationsraspberry yogurt &amp; raspberry jellostrawberry yogurt &amp; strawberry jelloIf  you garnish it with fresh berries once it sets  it looks really fancybut it is so quick &amp; easy to makeIt tasted great in every flavor.  Very light &amp; fluffy    YUM  :o)In the future I am going to try coconut yogurt &amp; pineapple jello ....  Pina Colada Pie !"
5.0,"I&#39;ve made this many times with different flavors of jello and yogurt, even mixing and matching like orange jello and lemon yogurt. No one even knows it&#39;s made with sugar free or reduced fat/sugar products. If you want to reduce the sugar, there are low sugar yogurts out there, even without aspartame.The one thing I never done yet is put it in a pie crust; I never saw the appeal of it in a pie. The filling is great as it&#39;s own thing: a fluffy, cool, and flavorful dessert."
5.0,So easy and delicious!
5.0,"You DO NOT have to use the same flavor jello as the yogurt. I really like raspberry yogurt with peach jello, for example. I usually use an Oreo crust with most of my pies just because I like the look and taste; and I always add plenty of fruit. Most of the time I will also use a juice or flavored iced tea in place of the water, but that does bring up the sugar count. LOVE these pies!"
5.0,Quick and easy.
5.0,"Follow recipe as written, soooo good, quick and easy. MJAnderson"
5.0,"My husband just yelled out &#34;good pie&#34;. Guess that means I can make it again.  Will try it in a different flavor, maybe orange in a chocolate graham cracker crust.  Hmm, that sounds good. This is so quick and easy to prepare."
5.0,Excellent! I made this using regular ingredients (no sugar-free or fat-free) and both hubby and I loved this pie. So easy and a great summer recipe! Next time I plan on using an Oreo cookie crust. I also plan on trying a lemon version of this pie.
5.0,Easy and quick!
5.0,I&#39;ve been making this one for years. Hard to believe it&#39;s so easy and yet so delicious! I use sugar free gelatin and light whipped topping.. I&#39;ve also made it with lemon gelatin and lemon yogurt. Sometimes I make it in an 8 x 8 square pan using just some graham cracker crumbs on the bottom instead of a crust to cut down on carbs. That way I get 9 servings  instead of 8.
5.0,Delicious and so easy to make!
5.0,My husband--who doesn&#39;t usually like low-fat foods--LOVES this pie.  I love it because it&#39;s delicious and super easy to make.
5.0,"Yum, this pie reminds me of my childhood and eating ambrosia salad. I know our family and friends will enjoy it this year at Thanksgiving. I used a Pillsbury pie crust in place of the graham cracker crust. Thanks for sharing ;)"
5.0,Very light and fluffy. Next time I am going to add cream cheese.
5.0,I&#39;ve made this for my diabetic husband and sons and everyone loves it!  I make it with low fat and sugar free ingredients. No one at our church pitch-in knew it was diet and low-fat!
5.0,"Wonderful. I did make my own crust and used i/2 the sugar and 2 tsp. Stevia Sweetener. Yogurt. I used plain Greek Yogurt and put in 1/2 tsp. Vanilla, Stevia to taste and squeezed a fresh lime into it. It is to die for. I am making it a regular summer treat, Oh who am I kidding, year round treat."
5.0,"I recently came across this recipe and I am so glad I did! This key lime pie is absolutely delicious and refreshing!  I have made it 3 times, each time changing it up a little. For example, even though I use the ingredients it calls for... the first time I used 2 containers of light yogurt w/ some fresh lime juice, the second time I used 1 light yogurt and 1 regular yogurt and this third time I used 1 light and 1 regular yogurt and again added fresh squeezed lime juice. I tasted it before pouring it into the crust and it was DELICIOUS! Third times a charm! It&#39;s just now setting in the refrigerator but I think from now on I will be adding lime juice b/c it enhances the flavors and makes it a bit more tangy. Yum!"
5.0,This dessert was a fluffy little piece of lime heaven!  I used regular jello and whipped topping as some other reviewers did.   This would be a perfect dessert for a summer gathering.  It just tastes like summer and is so easy!
5.0,Well this was a big hit with hubby and I.  Made it just as the recipe was printed.  Would definitely make it again and again.
5.0,I made this pie today and give it a huge thumbs up. My husband and I both loved this pie. So easy with only 4 ingredients. It makes a great last minute dessert. I highly recommend this pie as a field editor for Taste of Home.
5.0,"I&#39;ve made this pie twice, so easy to make and they came out flawless and scrumptious.  My husband loves the recipe and so do I...this is a definite keeper and our families will be enjoying it in the future!  I followed the recipe, but also added a little lime juice to increase the &#34;tang factor.&#34;"
5.0,Very nice and very easy.  Can also be modified using different flavors of jello &amp; yogurt.
5.0,"Great recipe, easier on glucose readings and delicious!  Thanks for sharing with us.  I don&#39;t care if it is green but for those who do ....don&#39;t make it! This so called sad imitation, as amateur cook called it, is better than most &#34;Key Lime&#39; pies I have eaten in some of the finest restaurants that not so amateur pastry chefs made!"
5.0,Lighten up people  -  so its not the real thing - its still good!
5.0,The key lime pie I have ever had was GREEN...limes are not yellow!!!  I have been making my grandmother&#39;s key lime pie for 40 yrs and  love the GREEN look and taste. This one looks yummy...am going to try!
5.0,Read the ingredients. Key lime yogurts. Enough said.
5.0,"First of all it is called Key Lime Pie because it is using key lime flavored yogurt.  Secondly, you can make this pie with cherry jello and cherry yogurt or strawberry jello and strawberry yogurt or whatever compatible flavors you like.  It is a delicious, light pie that everyone seems to enjoy whenever it is served."
5.0,I have been making for years. I&#39;M diabetic and this is one of my go to desserts when i want something light. Super easy to make
5.0,"It&#39;s a wonderful pie.  If you don&#39;t want to make it (and miss out on a delicious, light dessert), simply because it doesn&#39;t use actual key limes, then don&#39;t make it.  But if you do, you&#39;re in for a real treat!!!  By the way, the color doesn&#39;t affect the taste."
5.0,I made this for a get-together along with a couple of other pies.  It was a hit!  Everyone loved it.  It&#39;s perfect for a light ending to a big meal.
5.0,"FYI:  Use caution when  you serve this to those who want SUGARFREE!  This recipe isn&#39;t! Check ALL your ingredients&#39; labels first before you serve this as SUGAR FREE!  If you used the Yoplait Yogurt, as I did, there are 14g of sugar per serving, plus the Graham Cracker crust might have some!  Mine will be for our dinner dessert TONIGHT!!"
5.0,This pie was very quick and easy to prepare.   I&#39;ll definitely make this over and over again.  Such a light lime taste.
5.0,"Easy, easy, easy!!!  Light and fluffy and taste great!  What more could you ask for?"
5.0,Loved this pie recipe!  My mom used to make a similar pie called Frosty Fruit.  I added drained crushed pineapple and a half cup of pecan pieces to this recipe.  My husband loved it!
5.0,Absolutely Delicious! It was SO easy to make and turned out just perfect. DEFINITELY will make this over and over!
5.0,"I have made this recipe several times and I love it! The first time I used chicken breast. Second time I used ground chicken. The ground chicken definitely made it feel more like chili. But I like them both. The changes I made along the way: omit one can of green chilies, add one can of beans which I then use to mash against the pot with a spoon (to get a thicker consistency more like chili), added some dried cilantro and a little more seasoning to taste to compensate for the extra beans. Yummy! Add some cornbread and you&#39;re done! Quick and easy!"
5.0,"This is a favorite in our home, especially on cold days!   During winter we have it regularly.  It has wonderful flavor, i use all ingredients except I  add a little bit of white chicken chili seasoning to it and put it in crock pot to cook.  At last add sour cream and whipping cream. Enjoy!"
5.0,I have been making this chili for several years now. I make it exactly as written. I sometimes have a little more chicken than one pound as it&#39;s hard to get a package of chicken breast that is 1 lb. I just usually use 3 breasts so sometimes it&#39;s a little more. When making for company I have added one more can of beans. It is delicious! My advice to someone making it for the first time is make it exactly as written and then make any adjustments you want for next time.
5.0,This is absolutely the best chicken chili.  I have made it for several different friends and everyone just loves it.  I make it EXACTLY as the recipe states.......delicious!!!!
5.0,"I, too, loved this chili.  Made a few minor changes per reviewers- additional can of beans, a little less sour cream and heavy cream.  Since it does turn out a bit soupy I serve it over rice or a baked or mashed potato.  Everyone who tries it, loves it."
5.0,Entered this chili in a chili cook-off contest and won!  Everyone loved it.  Made the recipe exactly as written.  I did smash one can of the beans to help thicken it up a bit.
5.0,This was really good! Easy to make and great on a chilly night. Loved the flavor. Thanks for sharing I will definitely make again.
5.0,"So yummy!  I like to use fresh garlic in place of garlic powder ( 4 cloves). I also use 3-4 cups chicken broth, one can chilies, and one can Rotel to this recipe."
5.0,I have made this twice now for soup suppers at church and everyone loves it!  The only thing that I found was that the sour cream doesn&#39;t want to mix in without being &#34;clumpy&#34; so next time I&#39;ll whisk the sour cream and whipping cream together first to help loosen up the sour cream.  Hopefully it will mix in more smoothly.  GREAT RECIPE!
5.0,"I loved this recipe! I added some red pepper flakes, and probably would add a little more next time. It does come out a little soupy, so I may try smashing some of the beans next time or using a little less broth. The sour cream and heavy cream added to the wonderful flavor, I served over brown rice which was a fantastic pair."
5.0,"This is a wonderfully rich and creamy chili that is quite different from other white chili recipes I&#39;ve tasted.  It has been a hit every time I&#39;ve made it.  I made two changes to the original recipe based on the reviews I read here.  I add a third can of northern beans and mash them to add thickness to the chili.  Also, instead of cooking a pound of boneless chicken breasts, I use the breast meat from a store-bought rotisserie chicken (Costco, in my case).  The breast meat is already seasoned, so no need for the garlic powder and canola oil.  I dice up the meat into 1/4&#34; cubes - a little smaller than the original recipe.  One of the easiest chilis I&#39;ve ever made and so delicious!"
5.0,"Easy to prepare, great alternative to standard chili receipt! I add sour cream later on once it is served, otherwise fantastic receipt!"
5.0,This was very light and easy to make.  I make it for work on St Pat&#39;s Day
5.0,Made this for my office for St. Patrick&#39;s Day.  Everybody LOVED it.  Am planning to make again to take in for Easter--one in peach and one in strawberry.  Super yummy!
5.0,"This is a very tasty dessert. I have made it for my diabetic sister , and my dieting self! it&#39;s really good, the only thing I did differently was I froze it instead of refridgerating it."
5.0,"I found this recipe in 2012 for St Pat&#39;s Day and have made a variety of flavors.  This and all the variations have been big hits.  The banana split one is the best-very well drained crushed pineapple, strawberry yogurt and jello with fresh strawberries chopped, some coconut too and small pieces of dark chocolate mixed with the cool whip is a great flavor too.  Slice a banana on the bottom and pour all the rest on top in the graham cracker crust.  Decorate with a few sliced strawberries and or coconut."
5.0,"Light, low cal, and doesn&#39;t taste like it.  Also is a Weight Watchers recipe."
5.0,"It&#39;s a HIT! This is so easy, inexpensive and absolutely delicious. Made this 3 times this week it&#39;s so popular with friends.  perfect light dessert for summertime!"
5.0,"Easy, quick and yummy - my favorite kind of recipe."
5.0,I&#39;ve been making this for a long time and with various flavours - always goes down a treat :)
5.0,Will surely make this one!
5.0,<p>I have used different Jello  flavors with matching yogurts on this one-peach is great!</p>
5.0,"I have made this recipe several times, twice for events I catered and also for my family.  Everyone LOVES it.  Its so quick and easy but people thing you really fussed."
5.0,"This is a perfect summer recipe, especially if you use a ready-made crust, since there&#39;s absolutely no baking involved. I love citrus of any kind, but lime is my favourite. I can see that I&#39;ll be making this again and again over the summer."
5.0,"This is an easy to make pie that is delicious and low in fat.  The filling makes a little more than will fit in the crust, so I just get out a spoon and eat what&#39;s left in the bowl.  I have made it several times and my family loves it."
5.0,"I got this recipe from my mom awhile ago who makes it for my dad who is diabetic.It&#39;s so easy to make and so yummy, and it&#39;s not insanely loaded with sugars and calories like most other desserts. My boyfriends loves it too, so it&#39;s a nice treat for us."
5.0,I make this recipe for my dad who is diabetic and he loves it!  You can also get cool whip in sugar free eliminating even more of the sugar.  I&#39;ve also tried it with different flavors of jello and yogurt and it works great!  It also tastes great even if you aren&#39;t diabetic!
5.0,"I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s &#34;fake&#34; key lime!  This was a hit with family and guests.  Since it&#39;s so easy to make, I plan to keep the ingredients on hand to make it often."
5.0,Very good.  Also tried with strawberry yogurt/jello and orange creme yogurt/jello.  These were a hit for summer.
5.0,"This is delicious, quick, easy, and fun to make. My grandsons and I have made it several times this summer. We also decided to expand the idea. We have since made orange pie using orange yogurt and orange jello and lemon pie the same way. Next week we are going to try cherry. We think there is a lot a variety possible with these ingredients."
5.0,This was so great on a hot day.  I did not put in a crust but in dessert cups.  I have also made it in Peach and I plan on making Lemon and Raspberry.  As long as the jello and yogurt match you can make any flavor.  We love it.
5.0,I made this pie for my kids &amp; they really liked it.
5.0,"SO easy, delicious, and light. LOVE IT!"
5.0,Very good recipe. My husband is a diabetic and he loves it!!
5.0,"I do not like lime flavor typically. I love this recipe the sour lime taste blends so well with the sweet graham cracker. My family loves it as well. Cool, delicious and easy."
5.0,"Very easy to assemble!  Am wondering if other flavors could be easily substituted as well (strawberry, raspberry);  seems it would work as long as you have matching yogurt/jello&#39;s."
5.0,This a an awesome recipe... I shredded my chicken and it was even better the second day....Whole family and staff loved it... Would not change a thing....
5.0,"I&#39;ve made this recipe several times for my family. We leave out the chicken for vegetarian style and serve it over baked potatoes, rice, or quinoa. They love it every time!"
5.0,"I love it, everyone in my home loves it, and I have been asked for the recipe many times.  I have to triple the recipe for my family. It is very easy to make."
5.0,"Wow, this is a winner!  Very tasty, with just the right amount of heat.   After cooking the chicken and onions on the stove, I put everything in my Crock Pot for 4 hours on Low.  I was using fat-free sour cream, so I mixed that with 2 tbsp. of cornstarch to keep it from separating.  And I didn&#39;t have any heavy cream, so I left that out, but it was plenty creamy without it.  I wouldn&#39;t change anything else; we really loved this recipe."
5.0,Had to try this when I saw how many reviews it had! I left out the whipping cream.  It turned out really great!
5.0,This is a great recipe as written; family loved it. I want to make this without the beans as my husband is on a special diet that allows basically no fiber. I am thinking of using pork in place of chicken and white potatoes in place of beans. Wondering if anyone has changed it around like this? As long as the flavor is there I would think this would work. Any suggestions are appreciated!
5.0,"My husband is a chili lover.  He was however, disappointed when I said we were having &#34;white chicken chili.&#34;  I left out the whipping cream and the recipe was fine as is.  When he ate it he was amazed and absolutely loved it.  This recipe is a keeper!"
5.0,I won yet another chili cook-off with this recipe last weekend. It&#39;s a keeper for sure!!!
5.0,Delicious!  This is definitely one of our favorites!
5.0,I used canned chicken - even faster and easier.  A new family favorite!
5.0,"I created an account simply to post this review. That&#39;s how good this chili is! I made it as described, and it was seriously amazing! I personally wouldn&#39;t change a thing.  I plan on making it again this weekend for out of town family that&#39;ll be staying with us. Don&#39;t hesitate to make this!"
5.0,Make this!  You&#39;ll be happy you did.
5.0,An extraordinary recipe.  We all loved this chili!  One of the better white chili recipes I&#39;ve tried.
5.0,"Delicious !! I loved it because it skips the tomatoes which I&#39;m tired of lately every quick dish is buried in tomato sauce.Had to improvise, only had 1 can of chilies, added a tsp of chipotle to make up for it.1 half breast wasn&#39;t a pound 2 was a little over. The extra bit of meat was a bonus.Don&#39;t always have heavy cream on hand, had to leave it out but used a bit of whole milk.Served it with crispy garlic Texas Toast.This is worth expanding for a crowd. It&#39;s a nice change from red chili that seems to be the rage."
5.0,"I was looking for a chili with a white sauce because the tomato sauce gives me heartburn. So does the white but not as bad, when I found this and made it for the first time. Now my family can&#39;t get enough of it!! It&#39;s not difficult to make at all! And heartburn, yeah probably. BUT WHO CARES THIS STUFF IS THE BOMB!! Thanks for the recipe, it&#39;s a hit and a change from the regular hamburger and red sauce. It&#39;s my new chili go to!!"
5.0,Now if there was just a way to convert to metric---Great Recipe---Thanks.
5.0,Thanks for that tip----didn&#39;t think about that-as I&#39;m sure other hadn&#39;t.
5.0,"This was great.  The only thing is you can not get lime yogurt here, so I mixed rapsberry yogurt with the lime jello and it was a great combo."
5.0,I loved this.  I used the Yoplait thick yogurt.  I have also paired this with other flavors of yogurt and jello with the same great results.
5.0,"I made this at Easter using lime juice instead of water for all my fussy eaters. Everyone LOVED it. My daughter has since made it using different flavors of jello, juice and yogurt and it continues to be a hit. A friend put the juice back on the heat after stirring in the jello. It quickly dissolved completely. I actually added a little lime zest to my pie for extra lime flavor. YUM!"
5.0,"This was very easy and very good!  I&#39;m not sure that it yields 7 servings if served as a main course (likely closer to 4).  Certainly, pre-cooked chicken (or turkey) could be used for even further ease, making it a great recipe for leftovers.  I used cannellini beans and part of me thought they weren&#39;t hearty enough.  I almost wanted to replace the beans with potato...but then I guess it wouldn&#39;t be chili!  Either way, I will certainly make it again!"
5.0,"This is great on a chilly, overcast day. My brother asked for this recipe."
5.0,"This is a wonderfully tasty chili. I got tired of tomato sauce, so this was a nice change. The first time I made this I tripled it for a family gathering and everyone loved it; I only put in half the chili amount though. It did get a bit soupy, but I just let it simmer longer."
5.0,"Really good recipe! However, after adding the sour cream and heavy cream it did get soupy. After adding the creams I ended up putting it back on low heat to warm it back up and then added a teaspoon or so of corn starch to thicken it up. Worked perfectly"
5.0,"My husband made this the other night for a crowd and it was delicious!  He did not add the jalapeno because we didn&#39;t know if all the people could handle or enjoy that.  Agree with the reviewers about it being thin, but you can add crackers at the table or just tweak with cornstarch, sour cream, or cream cheese."
5.0,"Runner up in a chili cook-off. However I did use a whole rotisserie chicken.  Was very thick, the way I wanted it based on the reviews below I did not want it to be thin. Crowd loved and I am almost certain I would have won if I hadn&#39;t run out. People came back for seconds before the last (5) people could judge it."
5.0,"I pretty much stuck to the recipe, except I used leftover chicken.  I did use one can of chilies and skip the cayenne pepper..so I guess I really didn&#39;t stick to the recipe.  It was good either way!"
5.0,"I have made this Chil several times.  I cook for Bingo, and  everyone really likes it.  At first they were afraid to try it, as they had never heard of it.  My family  also thinks it&#39;s great!"
5.0,"Love this chili!  Since I don’t like things too spicy, I used less cayenne pepper and it was perfect."
5.0,"Besides being delicious, it&#39;s greatest strengths are it soooooo easy and quick. The only thing I did differently is used 1 can of garbanzo beans and 1 can of No. beans (didn&#39;t have 2 cans of Northerns).  I, too, simmered it a bit longer to make it more chili-like."
5.0,"My family loves the chili.  I thought the beans might scare my little ones so I blended it in my immersion blender a bit.  The second time I made it, I did not blend and everyone enjoyed it and requested seconds.  Great recipe.  Thanks for sharing."
5.0,My fiance and I really enjoyed this dessert. It was so easy and very delicious too. We will be making it again and passing the recipe onto other family and friends!.. Thanks for the great recipe!!!!
5.0,"Delicious, light and easy to make.  I made mine with peach jello and peach yogurt and served it with a dollop of whipped cream. Would be great made with any flavor!"
5.0,"I made this and took it into work.  Everyone loved it.  It was light, creamy, delicious and low fat.  Carol"
5.0,"Yum! If you like really thick chili, I would suggest cutting back on the stock and sour cream/whipping cream a bit (and maybe the cayenne pepper too then) or adding a bit of cornstarch to thicken or pureeing a portion as other reviewers mentioned, but we thought it was really good as written! Just the right spiciness- I can&#39;t tolerate much heat but this leaves just a little &#39;bite&#39; in your mouth after eating it. (Or...if it&#39;s too thin- maybe you&#39;re not simmering it long enough with the lid off?)"
5.0,"I made this chili for our Super Bowl party.  Everyone raved about how good it was and requested the recipe.  The only thing I did differently was simmered it all day so the flavors could meld and the chicken would be super tender.  It&#39;s not a real thick chili but that could easily be remedied by adding a little cornstarch, if that bothers you.  Otherwise, this is a delicious recipe and I&#39;m so glad I gave it a try.  It&#39;s a keeper!  :)"
5.0,Loved it!! Had a perfect little spice.
5.0,"Excellent recipe! Easy and quick. A keeper! Next time I may add some frozen corn. Joyce Moynihan, Volunteer Field Editor"
5.0,Greta recipe. Used a rotisserie chicken when I made it.
5.0,"Excellent - I took the advice of a previous review and added 1 TBSP of flour to the chicken onion garlic mix. I used two Jalapenos instead of the canned chilies. I had to puree the beans only because my DH doesn&#39;t like the bean texture and I used butter beans.  Lastly, I used 4 oz of cream cheese I had left in the fridge and a splash of heavy cream.  EXCELLENT."
5.0,"BEST RECIPE EVER!! We all loved it, and I have some picky eaters! Thank you for sharing !! So yummy and easy to make. I didn’t delete anything but added red pepper. Even without that change it would be amazing!! Thank you for sharing! A new family fav!! Yesss!!"
5.0,I LOVE this recipe. I use 1.5-2 pounds of shredded chicken instead of cubed. Perfect for dipping tortilla chips in as well.
5.0,"This is a really good recipe.  I made it for the first time last night -- need a white chili recipe to take to a gathering.  I got a lot of compliments on it, and several requests for the recipe.  I added minced garlic to it, and additional chicken broth.  Next time, I&#39;ll probably triple the recipe -- as written, the yield is pretty small."
5.0,"Made this for the first time, last night.  Read all the reviews first. However, followed the exact recipe,  Results:  Thinner than desired, but quickly fixed that with the great suggestion of 1 to 2 Tbls flour.  Served with Tortilla chips. Great flavor, big hit with the husband!  Will make again with rotisserie chicken and replace the whipping cream and sour cream with cream cheese.  Unless a thinner chili is preferred, use the flour as other reviews suggest."
5.0,I found this recipe about a month ago and my boyfriend is obsessed. He made me bring it to Thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit. He&#39;s having me make it again tonight for his birthday lol It really is the best chili ever.
5.0,Very good recipe.  you do need to add a couple of teaspoons of cornstarch to it in order to thicken it up.  I did omit the green chiles in order to control the heat.  they can be added when served if you like it to be more spicy.  Good for me without the chiles.  I also love to eat regular chili served over rice.  I did the same with this and it was great.
5.0,"So good! I doubled the recipe. Mine came out very thick because I blended 1/2 the beans with the chicken broth, then added the rest of the beans. I may need to add a splash of water in each serving. I could go a little hotter next time. I got a large jalapeño so only put in one, minced mine. Maybe 2 next time. Used rotisserie chicken as a shortcut. Really delicious tho!"
5.0,"Getting the jello to dissolve in the hot water was a bit difficult.The church ladies said it was delicious, and so did my husband.46041"
5.0,This recipe is great. I&#39;ve made it many times for guests. I also like to make it using strawberry jello and yogurt. Also I thought using peach jello and yogurt would be great in the summer when fresh peaches are in season. I&#39;ve given the recipe to my sister-in-law.
5.0,"We made this on vacation.  Everyone loved it!  I changed the flavors around and made four different pies: lemon, strawberry, orange and berry.  They were all very good.  The men like the lemon and key lime the best.  They didn&#39;t even know it was a healthy dessert..hehe.  I have been recommending this to everyone!"
5.0,"This was just excellent.  I used half a pound of dry beans that I had cooked in my instant pot, as well as shredded chicken from bone-in thighs (also cooked in the pressure cooker).  Didn&#39;t want to use heavy cream, so I just used a little milk and thickened with a couple of tablespoons of masa harina.  I also shaved off a few calories with fat-free sour cream.  Still very creamy and delicious.  Probably could have added another can of green chiles, and may just do that next time I make a batch of this."
5.0,"Very good. I wonder if it once had cream cheese and taste of home changed the recipe.  I prefer it with navy beans that are smaller. I also used canned chicken from Costco because that’s what I had. I used fat free cream cheese along with the whipping cream, and then I stirred the cheddar cheese in at the end."
5.0,I didn&#39;t change  a single thing!! Love it!!
5.0,This was hands down the most delicious white chili I have ever had! I did not add tortilla chips and only used 1 can of the green chili’s and it was perfect!
5.0,"Delicious, and easy to make. I followed the recipe with only tiny tweeks. I didnt have any cumin so i used a little chili powder instead. I also used just a little garlic, only because we are both sensitive to it, but if you are not, then go for it. Im sure it would add a lot.  I didn&#39;t have sharp cheddar so i used 4 cheese Mecican blend shredded. Worked fine. But these were minor tweeks and I&#39;m sure it is fabulous just as written too. Mine was plenty thick so i dont know why some people felt theirs was too thin.  I did set out the 2 creams when i first started the dish so they wouldn&#39;t be so cold. When ready to add them i stirred a couple teaspoon of the hot chili into each to warm them up before adding so they wouldnt curdle. I will defimitely make this again. Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe."
5.0,"Oh my gosh ..so good!, I substituted canelli beans because I like them better.  I added just one can of green Chile’s and NO heavy whipping cream (or no substitute for it).  Like others suggested for thicker chili-like texture I added one tablespoon of flour to chicken"
5.0,This is a very good recipe. If needed it&#39;s easy to change it. I had to make some changes. I cannot have beans so I didn&#39;t put them in. I didn&#39;t have green chili so I added a can of tomatoes with green chillies. It came out great. I love recipes that can be changed to fit the person. Will be making this again.
5.0,This is a very easy recipe that delivers excellent results.  Could not get over how good it was.  Will make again.
5.0,Very tasty and quite simple to make
5.0,"I make this every year for Thanksgiving. I substitute turkey and turkey broth instead of chicken. Everyone loves it!!! If i miss a year making it, the family is complaining and wanting it."
5.0,"This pie was so simple to make and tastes so delicious.  The next time I make it, I will try using a different flavor of jello and yogurt."
5.0,I made this to go with our St.Paddy&#39;s Day supper. Great hit loved by all. The cool lime flavor would go great on a hot summer day. Very easy and Quick to make. Could easiely be made in several flavors by changing the Jello and yogurt flavors. Will make again often Thanx
5.0,Made this pie and brought into office.  Went over really well.   This is so easy to make and so tasty.  I made a Raspberry the next day and I want to make it in strawberry next time using strawberry cool whip.
5.0,"Warm bowl should be used for Jello and hot water mix; with cold bowl, Jello does not dissolve as hot water &#39;cools off&#39; too quickly!"
5.0,"This is the BEST white chicken chili I have ever tasted.  Everyone loved it and I am asked to make it all the time.  I am confused, however, by the little note at the beginning of the recipe which reads &#34;Maybe it&#39;s the cream cheese&#34;.  Am I missing something?  I don&#39;t see cream cheese in the ingredients list anywhere.  Sounds like it would be good, though.  I highly recommend this chili!"
5.0,"For those asking about the cream cheese, they changed the recipe online. It used to have cream cheese in place of the sour cream. I’ve made this recipe for years. I always look it up before I buy the ingredients to make sure I don’t miss anything. I search by “white chicken chili cream cheese ” to make sure I pull up this recipe. I was surprised to see sour cream now, especially because they specifically mention cream cheese in the description. I will continue to make it with the cream cheese because this is a family favorite and I don’t want to change what’s not broken. I make this close to the post recipe, but I do slow cook it on the stove with boneless skinless chicken breast and I also add cilantro when I mix in the cream and cream cheese. My picky boys love it!"
5.0,"We&#39;ve made this several times through the years, and it never disappoints!  Also, recipe doubles well."
5.0,I have made this for several years. It is definitely a favorite in this house. I&#39;ll need to double it in the future.
5.0,"So easy and flavorful, will be a new regular recipe in my house"
5.0,Family favorite for many years. I’ve share this recipe with family
5.0,"Made this just as the recipie called for and it was delicious! Hubby loves it as well, will be making it again soon!"
5.0,"My absolute favorite chili recipe, it’s so easy and delicious! I added half a can of corn and a little hot sauce to the recipe and it’s amazing!!"
5.0,"This is the best white chili I’ve ever had. It is a hit with this family, old and young.  I always think I might have some for a few days, but it never lasts that long. He never gets tired of it and neither do I!"
5.0,"This recipe is amazing. I’ve been making it for years. Ignore the rude and ignorant comments from those who have yet to actually make it. If you want spicy feel free to add as much or as little of the cayenne pepper or jalapeños with or without seeds to your liking. That’s the beauty of cooking at home. One tip I will give, if you want an extra creamy texture, add the creams in right away and let simmer until reduced."
5.0,Very delicious and easy to make!!
5.0,This recipe is awesome. Made it iver 10 times now. A big hit with the family!
5.0,We have been making this for years now and its hands down our favorite chili recipe.  One thing I love about it is that you can substitute low fat versions of the cream/sour cream and its still just as good.  I&#39;ve even used skim milk in place of the whipping cream with no problems!   We always serve it with the  Zucchini &amp; Cheese Drop biscuits.  To die for!
5.0,This recipe was extremely easy to make and very tasty.  I used a chocolate crust instead of a graham cracker crust.  I will make this again and try it with different gelatins and yogurts.  Strawberry sounds good with fresh strawberries layered in the bottom.
5.0,This is so easy and fast to make.  I will try it with other flavors too.
5.0,This was so good and so easy. You could easily switch the jello and yogurt flavors to make the pie different.
5.0,I put the pie in the freezer.  Add a little whipped topping and it is delicious served frozen.
5.0,I made this for movie night with a few friends.  It got rave reviews and I thought it was yummy.  On advice of previous reviews I used cream cheese instead of sour cream.  I also popped a whole jalapeno in for the cooking process and fished it out and discarded when cooking was complete.  Made it a day ahead of time.  The one person in the group who doesn&#39;t like heat said it was just right.  This is definitely going into my file of favorites!
5.0,"I changed this a little.  I added carrots, potatoes and substituted coconut cream for the cream.  I also left out the cumin.  The creamy mix of the sour cream and cream made this soup delicious."
5.0,"Delicious!!  First time ever making a white chili and this one delivered in every way.  Fantastic as is, didnt change a thing.  Will be a favorite keeper for me!! Thanks for sharing!"
5.0,"i made this last night for dinner. It went together very fast and based on another reviewer, I added 8 ounces of cream cheese instead of the sour cream. I accidently added too much cayenne so I did offer sour cream at the table along with shredded cheese. Personally, I am not much of a fan of beans of any kind, but this chili was good. The only problem was it did not make enough for the hearty appetites for all the people at the table. Next time I make this I will double the recipe. But this is a keeper even by my standards."
5.0,"I doubled the recipe. I also substituted the sour cream with cream cheese, added corn and bell peppers. Topped with sour cream, cilantro, shredded cheddar, and fritos! I am sooo very satisfied!"
5.0,This is my all-time favorite white chili recipe. I make it as is except I will add a can of hominy and occasionally substitute pork for the chicken.  Great with a spoonful of pico as well.  So good!!
5.0,"We LOVE this recipe and fix it often!  I even make it to take to people when they need a meal.  A couple of things, I use unsalted chicken stock (the 32 oz box) instead of the broth and instead of the sour cream and heavy cream, I use a 12 oz container of Gandy&#39;s French Onion or Green Chili Dip.  It just adds a little depth in flavor that we enjoy!"
5.0,"The best, while iit is &#34;hot&#39; it is not a long lasting hoe."
5.0,"Delicious. I added a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis, and it turned out great!"
5.0,"been making this for my family for a couple decades now, and it&#39;s always gotten rave reviews.  I do add real garlic along with the chicken, garlic powder, and onion to sauté, before adding the rest of the ingredients.  In the past I&#39;ve substituted evaporated skim milk for the heavy cream, and it turns out well that way, too.  I cut back on the cayenne for my own reasons, but my daughter loved it full strength.  Probably going to be making this recipe for another couple decades as well."
5.0,"I didn&#39;t see cream cheese in the recipe, but it was in the description so I added it toward the end.  I added a little Adobo seasoning and used my own dried cayenne,  also added diced tomatoes with  green chili&#39;s, otherwise made the recipe as written. It was fabulous. A forever keeper. Thank you!!"
5.0,This is one of the few recipes I use where I don’t change the ingredients. Love it.
5.0,"This was EXCELLENT! I only had 1 can of  chili’s so I opened a can of jalapenos and added a teaspoon.  I threw it all in the Ninja Foodie and put it under pressure for 20 mins with quick release. THEN I added the sour cream and whipping cream. I served with crisp tortillas and shredded cheese. It was loved by all, even my granddaughter. I will be making this again! Oh, I didn’t have great northern beans so I used two cans of white beans. Turned out perfect."
5.0,"THIS RECIPE IS WONDERFUL, LOVE LOVE LOVE."
5.0,"This is a great recipe - very easy and oh so good. I&#39;ve experimented with other flavors of jello and yogurt and have had wonderful results. (strawberry jello and strawberry yogurt, lemon, orange, etc.)"
5.0,I have made this pie for a couple of years and it is oh so fast and easy. I have taken it losts of places and everyone likes it so I share the recipe lots. Rena
5.0,"Re: Fluffy Key Lime PieI also agree, excellent recipe have also tried several different flavors. Our favorite is still the Key Lime. Have also done the recipe without the graham cracker crust.Barb C"
5.0,Weight Watchers has put this recipe in their handouts for years. I have made it many times &amp; it has always gone over well. You can make it it in many flavors- try using peach yogurt &amp; jello.
5.0,Very refreshing and so easy!  You can make this with different flavors.  Next time I&#39;ll try strawberry.
5.0,"I made this for our Bible Study adult group and used 1 carton of cheesecake yogart and one vanila, then added 1 tbl. key lime juice.  it was wonderful and everyone loved it.  Shared the receipe with all present."
5.0,"I made this tonight and it couldn’t have been easier PLUS it was really delicious.  This is a keeper!  *As I write this review, my husband is getting himself seconds."
5.0,"This recipe is so easy and delicious.  I also have used different varieties of jello/yogurts.  Key Lime is my favorite, but I like the orange dreamcycle also.  This dessest is so lite, you always have room for it."
5.0,"I&#39;ve done a variation on this - just jello and key lime yoghurt, but this looks even yummier, and will be on my &#34;must-make&#34; list for summer desserts. Thanks."
5.0,"This is the best chili recipe, I have gotten 3 blue ribbons making it for company cook offs, Last year mad it for a Halloween party and it got RAVE reviews, this year the party was banned 9but we had it anyway) and the local police officer came to the party in the uniform and said &#34;I won&#39;t say anything if I get some of that chili you made last year&#34;.   LOL"
5.0,I’ve made this chili for several years and follow the recipe as written. I use chicken tenderloins and heavy cream and sour cream.  “If it’s not broken don’t fix it”.  It’s the perfect comfort food on a cold day!  The tortilla chips go perfectly and a grilled cheese on the side doesn’t hurt either  (especially if made with home made pimento cheese)!
5.0,Outstanding just the way it is!
5.0,"This was absolutely DELICIOUS! It was my first time making chili, and I loved it.  It turned out a lot more soupy than I expected,  and I even mashed up a cup of the beans like the recipe said.  I think next time I make this, I won&#39;t add the cream to see 9f that makes thicker. But is super yummy, even if it is more of a soup/stew. ? Yummm!"
5.0,"I don&#39;t change a thing in this recipe, it&#39;sperfect as directed.  I found it in my Taste of Home cookbook years ago and have been making it ever since. I don&#39;t even look for other recipes because why mess with perfection.  I was just diagnosed with gluten intolerance and thankfully this recipe is.     *** my ex-husband would not eat chicken so my son made it with pork (also delicious). He still used chicken stock but the ex didn&#39;t know that!   ***"
5.0,EXCELLENT RECIPE!! This will be on regular rotation.
5.0,"I make this for my son-in-law for when he has to work cold winter nights in Michigan.  He loves it!  Instead of green chiles, I changed to Hatch Green Chiles to give it a little kick.  You can use as much or as little depending on how you like it."
5.0,Wonderful recipe as written! Only change I made was I used rotisserie chicken because I always have it on hand in my freezer as a time saver. Even my husband who said chili can&#39;t be white said to make sure to keep this recipe!  Thanks Laura for making him a believer!
5.0,WOW! Total WOW! Totally delicious. 5 stars plus.
5.0,Very good!! Easy recipe … first time followed exactly but I added flour to chicken and onion mixture to help thicken and did not add cream cheese. Made a second time with no mild chilies and only a few shakes of cayenne and it was still good! Liked it less spicy! But will make again! Other in family liked it too!
5.0,This is our go-to chicken chili recipe and has been for years. We love it and it&#39;s so simple.
5.0,"Delicious!!!   A huge hit with family and friends.  Several requests to make again.  And share recipe!!! 
Thank you!!!!"
5.0,"This is a hit in my house. I have been making it for a few years now.  I typically  double the recipe as written, adding only a can or two of sweet corn.  We always eat this with jiffy cornbread. Absolutely a favorite."
5.0,My new favorite soup! Oh my! So delicious!
5.0,Tasty &#34;mistake&#34; we loved.  I made 1/2 batch for the 2 of us and accidently used diced tomatoes and green chilies 14.5 oz can  in my pantry right next to diced tomatoes on shelf.  It gave it just  a  little more &#34;kick&#34;.  I didn&#39;t add salt and I stir fried about 1/2 cup of chopped onions with the ground beef.  It was delicious and my husband really liked it.
5.0,"I have made this soup 6 or 7 times. It is so good!  I have also taught a couple of people how to make it since they loved it when they had it at my house. I also used beef broth rather than bouillon and water, and also added onion and garlic. We also use 2 green peppers and 1 red pepper. This is a recipe I’ll use for years to come!!"
5.0,"This soup is absolutely amazing! My kids thought it tasted like tacos and enjoyed topping the soup with shredded cheese, sour cream and crumbled tortilla chips for a fun, fiesta kind of feel!"
5.0,"Bush used to have a white chili bean and it made this recipe super simple. I’ve written to them and asked them to please!, bring them back"
5.0,"One of the best soups ever.  I didn’t use beef bullion but used 1 litre of beef broth and 2 cups of water. Also as others have said, added an onion, chopped celery, garlic, a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and a few dashes of hot sauce. If your kids don’t like diced tomatoes, omit them and add an extra can of tomato sauce."
5.0,Best stuffed pepper soup I have ever had. Only change I made was adding 4 cups of cooked rice instead of 2.
5.0,Delicious!! Will make again!
5.0,"This soup is yummy and the hubby loved it too! I added a large onion, two cloves of garlic and a few splashes of worchesire sauce. I did not put rice in it. Will definitely make it again!"
5.0,Soooooo yummy!!!
5.0,My family enjoyed this
5.0,We had an abundance of tomatoes and green peppers in out summer garden so I was able to those fo the diced tomatoes and green pepper. I did not use cooked rice but since the soup was simmering I let the rice cook in the soup. Everyone loved it.
5.0,"I tweaked it a little, removed onions because of onion haters in my house, used Italian seasoning instead of just oregano, and use a paprika/ cayenne mix and a little more than the recipe called for.. we like everything a bit more hot. The chili was amazing! It was easy to make and everyone absolutely loved it. It will now be a staple meal in our house."
