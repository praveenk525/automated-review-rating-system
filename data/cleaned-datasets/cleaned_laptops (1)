2,"Very delicate, poor Hardware surely not a good laptop"
2,Value for money
2,Build quality of Acer Nitro from 4 or 5 years ago was much better than this. The keyboard seems relatively flimsy for a gaming laptop. The worst design flaw of this laptop is that the display opens up in such a way that that the hot air from the fan vents hit one side of the bottom of the display which starts heating up. This most definitely reduces the life of the display. It doesn't feel as if this laptop Nitro model is durable enough to last more than a couple of years.
2,Not ok

3,I think product is good but I am not satisfied with battery backup
3,"I bought this laptop on 19th August 2023
It is good but battery drains fast, you will have to buy Microsoft Package , there is no inbuilt Ms ppt or ms word. You will have to use Google doc and ppt. Laptop and mobile cannot be connected through Bluetooth, camera quality not up to the mark.
Touch 10/10."
3,Average not worth
3,"Laptop is good upto some extent...I mean considering the price , product is decent . You can't expect much from the entry level laptop . Sound was just okaish ,rest you can do regular ofc work easily. Screen neither bad nor very good. Pls note you can do casual gaming but not heavy. Laptop gets heated sometimes."
3,Sound quality is too low
3,"screen size is 15inches not 15.6
low audio"

Cons:
Frequent heating while charging.
While running zoom, the issue occurs with speaker due to AI audio. They need to improve their AI software.
Overall 7/10 given the price of the product."

3,"It's ok with all features.But if you just flip the cover without shut down ,in next opening the system does not responds."
3,Keyboard lights are absent in this model
3,"The only problem with this laptop is its thermal management which is poorly done. Even when doing light tasks its gets certainly warm on the keyboard surface.
Rest the processor is good, fine display and the overall software experience.
But avoid buying Dell laptops as they will get hot under light to moderate usage which is not expected.
Dell should improve its thermal management in laptops."

3,"Waste of money. You get the extra bang for the buck with the performance and a killer screen but at what cost? What's the point of a handheld that lasts only 2 hours on battery life? Also, windows is a terrible OS for a handheld. I ended up nuking windows and running Steam OS on this. Another headache though is getting armoury crate on steam os. Couldn't control the wattage so had to end up back on windows which is absolutely useless for a handheld device without a keyboard and a mouse. Get a...

Especially the white and black colour comes with sub par cooling system and the fan has started making a weird cranking noise which is suspect is from a bad bearing in the fan.

Touch pad do not work properly, the click is very bad some times you have to click more times. In case of display the font blurry and not readable. Again I'm saying designers and developers don't buy this. For watching films it's okay."

3,Battery lasted longer than my first relationship (2.5 hours). Listening to arijit singh songs on full volume since then still isn't getting over(weak speaker). Has more warmth than her. unlike her there's two way communication here as touchpad is very responsive. Fingerprint lock is nice as it only opens up to me. 5 stars for this -2 for My ex

3,"This laptop is very good considering the price range in which no more options available in the market but yet there are few cons you need to consider before buying it.
1) Limited Storage Slots - It comes with only 1 m.2 nvme slot. So in order to expand the store you have to replace the original with a new one.
2) The build of the laptop is totally plastic. So it can't handle any sudden damages.
3) Even with 4gb graphics card it struggles to provide decent frame rate in most of the games. ( Go...

It‚Äôs best suitable for students who attend online classes.
However, it‚Äôs not compatible to take online classes and android applications are not working as affectively as they are in an android phone.
For everything we need Internet connection."

It's been 3 weeks since I started using this laptop. I see that the performance of this laptop is satisfactory, no major issues noticed as of now.

Only thing that I would specifically mention here is that the volume is very less when compared to any other laptops. Also being an audiophile, I feel that the clarity of the sound is not good.

Previously I had lenovo laptop and I experienced awesome audion in there. Expecting the same, I bought this laptop but to my surprise, ...

Fan stop working ssd buzzing is still normal.
Laptop performance is good. Battery life is about 4-5 hrs . There is some little bit buzzing noise coming from SSD which i found normal. Apart from this rest laptop is outstanding in performance."

I can't say the same with build quality. It feels fragile. Also it has the shittiest trackpad which stopped working completely in just 1.5 months. The lower body is replaced in warranty but such problems too early is not expected. They opened the whole laptop and now build quality is even more degraded since then."
3,Product is good will review after few months usage
3,The battery capacity in 3 months of usage dropped to 94% of the original with just 72 charge cycles. But if you are using it with just internet connectivity and productivity tasks then it lands you around 7-8 hours of backup in initial days and what happens after it I already mentioned it. Speakers are a bit disappointing with low loudness. Display is good with pretty nice peak brightness.

I have chosen this laptop for its power efficiency, expecting it's less power hungry than all Intel processors and other ryzen processors. But the reality is the opposite.

I charged it as per HP recommendations. Still it Lasts up to 3 hours only. Drains very quickly after the first 2 hours. There is a significant drop in battery power after a shut down and a fresh start. Thus, disabled fast start up of Windows 11. Still this problem persists to some extent."

Drawbacks:
No backlit keyboard.
No fingerprint scanner.
No SD card slot.
Only 2 USB Type-A slots.
No RAM upgrade options.

Look and feel is good

Cons:-
1.Sound is very low cause speakers are present in the down part

i) OLED screen is fabulous, punchy colors, good brightness, overall great display.
ii) Lookwise, i would say ok ok , not so good looking not so bad either, it is fine.
iii) Performance wise it is good, it handles day to days tasks easily. I use it for office use only (word, excel, pdf etc). For these it is buttery smooth. I have not any game on it or haven't done heavy tasks on it than can test its limits. So for my office use it is smooth.

Positives
1. Fast booting
2. MS Office pre installed

Could be better
1. Very Basic sound quality
2. Viewing angel ( if you tilt it visibility distracts)
3. No indicator (lights) on keyboard side of laptop.
4. Indicator for Num lock and Caps lock missing

Missing

3,Overall performance is ok but laptop is quite flimsy. Battery back up is just ok 3 to 3 .5hrs. Heating issue is there and quite unfortunate that the warranty is only for 10months as it has started two months earlier from the date of purchase. Considering the warranty factor and the packing(the box was open can see through the tape ) I presume that this is used or returned product.
3,"Its good laptop for budget peoples , don't go for buying by see the ms office . It takes much time to load heavy sites and doing a project in powerpoint was too slow for this laptop .

Main Thing, The SMPS should not be placed directly below the display, as this causes the lower right side of the display to overheat."

3,"It is a good machine, but with some drawbacks.
While gaming, you can feel the heat as the exhaust vent is opened towards the display, the screen itself gets a bit hot. Again the temperature would not affect the screen. But you can feel the warmth on your finger tips on the keyboard while gaming. It feels a bit uncomfortable.

I have played GTA 5, Minecraft, valorant and Palworld in it. The performance it gives is as per the expectation. It performs what it should be.

I preferred Asus Laptop, Asus better than Acer."
3,"See... If you are choosing this for creative works like coding, animation or some gaming kind then this is a good choice.. but for content consumer, it's a bad choice cause the sound quality is literally the worst I have ever experienced. You have to use external speaker.
See I am a current user and I m not just joking or anyway commenting on product. Whatever I shared was my feedback after usage..."
3,"The worst part of this laptop is the battery backup, I thought it's a creator series laptop, and it would give at least 4 hours on normal usage, it made me wrong and giving just 2 hours in normal usage even in battery saver mode. Don't know is this in my laptop or in every laptop of this series.

Another disappointment is heating issue, even in normal usage it heats a hell, the fan will start running and make sounds.

Performance is ok on plug and play (i.e when connected with charger).

3,"Worst display
Dead pixels
Not at all a ips display"
3,Display is very bad.....go for ips panel
3,Everything is good except the TN Panel. It is too fade in colors when you compare with IPS Panel. Buy it if your use is just for productive purpose. For entertainment purpose it's not recommend.
3,Display is below average. Improvement needed. Because of display 45 k for this laptop not worth it.
3,"Overall the laptop is good.
Voice is a bit low not loud for any general meetings.
In a silent room you can listen to music or watch movies.
The display is below average. The viewing angle may disappoint you and is not meant for long hours of working.
May overheat during game play.
You can't upgrade your RAM, because it is soldered on the motherboard.
After that everything is awesome.
Good for college students, Its performance never disappoints you."

3,"If you're expecting good battery backup, please don't go for it. And sound volume quality should be improve."
3,"Overall, the build quality and sound of the laptop are commendable, fitting for a gaming laptop. However, there are some areas that could be improved:

Battery Life: For a gaming laptop, a battery life of more than 3 hours for normal usage is expected. The laptop lasts around 2 and a half hours when running demanding tasks like Docker, Spring Boot, and VS Code, and around 3 hours for web browsing, document reading, and day-to-day tasks. Gaming sessions typically last between 40 minutes to 1 h...

Battery is performing pretty good now , actual performance can be reviewed after sometime

Design is a lower part in this laptop as it can be improved as you are spending handsome amount and getting a fibre plastic body at bottom which looks cheap.

Display is above average as it has a decent display and full eye protection

Overall value for money but the most disappointing things are one is plastic body at bottom and 2nd is worst audio spe...

Honestly I took a risk,but it paid off,this version is as good as the intel one(one of my friends has it) and it's cheaper(at least 5-10k difference).

4,Good device... üëæüñ§
4,Battery backup is about 4 hours on normal uses and it should be improved by HP according to price. it's light weight bt not proper weight management.

4,"It's a excellent choice, specially if you are buying it for work, free lancing and to learn new skills, It is great in both performance and battery in this price. Absolutely buy it. Giving it a 4 star as the piece I got has a little tight hinge and it won't open single handedly, which doesn't give a good Impression, and I can't even return it now and have to go apple service centre, But be real everybody doesn't have time to waste a whole day for this problem."

Purely Not a performance laptop.
Lenovo proved, Specs and processor won't decides performance.
Even zoom screen sharing makes this laptop hanging.
It won't meet even 20k worth laptop from HP in terms of performance.

Better go for 3-k higher than this price rage , but not Lenovo.üî•üéâ"

I have only one issue that is the charger which comes with it is not made by Acer company due to this it's adaptor gets heat quickly.

Overall Nice experience.

Go for it."

4,"Good product, but average Display in this price range"
4,Value fore money
4,"Lifetime MS Office basic also needs, will help a lot"
4,ok for home use
4,Osm üòá mst
4,good product
4,It's too good value for money ü•∞ü•∞.
4,"Value for money product, mainly for official use and a light gaming. Good for college students, however the display and sound speakers are not very good."
4,"5* for the look
4* performance
2* sound quality
4* webcam
4* display
Battery life while running heavy software (research software for DFT) is maximum 2 hours, otherwise in standby mode 10-12 hours is the battery life.
Data transfer speed with SATA SSD external drive is maximum 708 MBps as it has NVMe type SSD, so it's faster than the external drive.
5* for the Value for money"
4,"As per specifications mentioned (i7 11Gen, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD, Win 11) this is the best product in this price range. But, I'll rate it as 4 star because of 2 reasons
1. Sound output is of very low volume. (It is acceptable because this laptop is under Business laptops category)
2. Web Camera quality is very much below par."
4,Sound is too bad but the other thing is perfect.
4,"Good for simple task, not for multitask...."
4,Overall a good package at budget pricing
4,It's a good laptop but I would suggest to go for a latest upgrade in this price range. I got it at 58k.

4,"Reviewing after one week of usage.

Firstly the laptop is very slim, light weight and it's easy to carry around. Also the build quality is great, the metallic body feels premium.

The OLED display makes the colours vibrant and dynamic making a great viewing experience.

Performance is equally good, never faced any lag during the usage.(Im not a gamer not sure how the device handles.)

No heating issue found during the usage.

Thanks to evo certified processor, this device on a single charge,...

To optimise it turn off 144hz refresh rate, turn on battery saver with 40% of the brightness and hence you will get extra 1 to 1.5 hr extra(If it 100% charged) and yes without playing a video game.
While playing a game always connect to your Charger."

4,"In this price range, you can't find a device that's built better than this. Everything about it - from the tab itself to the kickstand, keyboard cover, and pen - feels nice and premium.

The display is gorgeous! Hands down one of the best screens I've looked at in a while. It's super bright, I've had no trouble with visibility outdoors. The colors are great.

The performance (for day to day tasks) is quick and snappy. Android apps run well, but you will notice some stutters with heavy tasks...

Let's start with the design first- Pretty simple and sleek design (although it's a gaming laptop) but I like it, it has a backlit keyboard and a fingerprint sensor too (which works good).
Now to the battery- it gives around 4 hours of backup on normal use. If you are playing games play with the charger connected.
Performance is really smooth I have the 16 gb version, I've seen no issues with performance.

The sound quality is normal ( didn't meet the expectation), display quality is also good but brightness may disappoint you ( does not look like 300nits). The battery backup is perfect. It comes with C-type charging port which supports thunderbolt cable ( good reason for me to buy this laptop)"
4,"Value for money. With android and Linux apps support, Chrome OS is better than ever. I've been using a different Asus chromebook for past 3 years and I could always depend on it whether it is for speed, reliability, or battery backup. I would always choose a mini laptop over tablet.

Reasons for not giving 5 stars for this model:
* Only 3 years support (end of life: June 2024). Reinstalling a different OS (Linux) is not straightforward and using outdated Chrome OS is not recommended

For now the only let down was the audio volume being too low. However I was able to download a volume booster app from ms store and that too is taken care off.

In my initial experience, the laptop is looking very nice and light weight. It is also good and working fine for now. I didn't like the Power key because it is too small. Backlit keyboard available but very low light that I don't like as well as the keyboard letters are very low visibility. The display is ok if you will see from the front, if you will see from the side it is like negative. I will use and check more details. After some months ...

Performance:
The laptop is powered by an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H processor, complemented by 32GB of LPDDR5 RAM and a 1TB SSD. On paper, this configuration promises top-tier performance, and in practice, the processor indeed works like a charm. Applications run smoothly, multitasking is a breeze, a...

It's no surprise that it's the go-to choice for those who prioritize speed and reliability in their computing experience.

Pros:

1. I upgraded from i3 2nd gen, so the 12th gen is a major upgrade. I mainly have a few apps like Zotero, MS office, BlueStacks, and so far I have seen a minimal lag. Nothing major. So, the performance is good for day2day use.

4,"After one year design is good, battery back up also good around 4-4:30hr. If you are using big software for regularly long time than fan create very irritating noise. I am using HFSS software for my project last 4 months regularly 7-8 hr in a day so after 4 months my laptop create noise and when i am stop on working on that software the noise will be completely gone. And one more thing vary less service centers for this and if you are going there they will take 4-5 days to repair it."
4,This laptop is value for money but battery backup 3-5 hours this for (-) point but all is ok.
4,goof
4,"The product is very nice and ok for the price,but the battery runs down easily"
4,"There is lag with multiple processes as the Processor speed is 1.0 GHz. It heats a lot and drains battery faster due to continuous running of the fan.
Another lacking thing is MS Office. You only get a trial version of it.
Rest all us perfectly fine as of now with a few days of usage."

4,"Product is good and decent. It is completely value for money. Like there are a lot of things where the company cuts the price. For example Speakers, Display, Keyboard. Speaker is just speaker no base or high volume. Display is also Not very good not very bad and Keyboard is like decent there is no backlight keyboard and Alphabets or number on keys are also like simple white coloured Sticker. I mean this laptop is totally worth it with the cost. If you want to use it like simple meetings, Offi...

But battery backup only long for 5 hours for normal task."
4,"Performance of this Laptop is amazing. Good work done by Hp. Launching time of every Software is taking very small time. Bootup time like 15 second
I feel like never before with Laptop.
Windows 11 is also crystal clear and user friendly experience.
So many thanks to Flipkart for safe & Secure Delivery by ekart.
I am so Happy with this product."
4,"The laptop is fantastic. Looks premium. I got pre-installed Windows 11 and Office along with it. Flipkart took 10 days to deliver it. A little bit of a disappointment there.

Booting is fast. i5 13th Gen makes it futuristic. The initial setup is seamless.
The backlit keyboard and privacy shutter for the camera make true sense in usability. The touchpad is smooth. The keyboard keystrokes are a little bit hard as compared to my HP laptop.

The only downside is the speakers. They are below aver...

My review after a week of use.
.Display is way better than my old Asus tuf f15, support upto 8k videos
.Battery is worst for high-end working, lasts less than 2 hours while editing, but lasts upto 6 hours if only playing videos.
.performance is good for this segment
Overall the product is decent for the price of 49k (credit card offer)"
4,One of the best choice for gaming and money for value product. SATA SSD Not Support in it. It has 2 slots for M.2 Nvme SSD.

I ordered 256 GB varient but storage is low 198GB"
4,Worth the price ... Got it in BBD sales ... Till now everything seems good
4,A good laptop
4,It's a 4 core i3 Processor means very heavy multitasking will not be possible but graphics related processes are smooth. Go for 16 GB RAM only as Heavy processes will need it otherwise it will be a total hang in coming years.
4,Good Prod
4,Good Quality This Price
4,"Value for money.Good for home usage.
Gaming not tested.
Performance is also good for home usage"

4,"One of the best laptop of this price. Display, Battery, everything is fine."
4,It is a very good product at this price range but I feel a little bit slow processing when running the laptop other wise the display quality and laptop quality is good . But the processing speed is may be better
4,"Performance is good
Display is also up to the Mark but when you watch side of the screen it shows black
Battery 2.5 for non stop use
Design is awesome"
4,Display is not upto the mark. The graphics card is also a bit outdated for modern games. But it is good for moderate gaming and other graphic intensive tasks.
4,All are good but sound üîä Quality is low üòì

So yes, if anyone wants to buy it then go for it."
4,Value for money working good delivered yesterday
4,"Overall, the laptop performs well, but the absence of an SD card slot is a significant drawback. This omission was not clearly mentioned, which was misleading, as all other Swift Go models include this feature."
4,"Initial Review
Pros:
1.Metal Body
2. Fingerprint Sensor
3. 1080 camera
Cons:
1. Very low speaker output
2. Should have given 1tb ssd
Laptop has 2 slots of Ram both used 8+8"
4,"Overall the laptop is good. But I reduced one star because the display is only average, no proper clarity even in 1080 pixels and speakers also producing less sounds, rest of performance it is buttery smooth with 16GB RAM and 512GB ssd. One good thing is the vents are colourful and less noise levels. Good for coding purpose"
4,Laptop's build quality isn't the best but okay in this price point . The fan starts spinning loud just for daily tasks yet to check gaming performance. Battery backup is bad but 170 watt charger is sweet charges the laptop in 1.5 hours.
4,40 fps on 4k with ultra settings in witcher 3 enhanced edition.
4,Good performance till now.
4,Display is good performance is also good but the sound is very low battery backup is also low if the company improves these two it will be a very good laptop
4,Thermals Are Very Good But while Running heavy apps like davinchi resolve and games like the evil within the app crashes we have to opp and on the laptop
4,All aspects of this laptop is ok. But screen wobble is serious. Otherwise totally worth it
4,Great buy
4,Very good product.Very nice design.it feels like a 50-60k laptop.amazing IPS display. Battery life is around 5-6 hours easily. Just check for any screen bleeding issue after you get delivery.overall value for money üëåüëå
4,"Every thing is excellent, bugget friendly product BUT right click refresh window frequency is some time low"
4,"Excellent value for money for those not needing gaming capability. Robust construction , light and compact. Camera could have been better!"
4,Very good product at an affordable rate.
4,Good laptop ‚ú®üñ§ go for it
4,The battery is good but charging gets slow from 60% to 100 % very slow. And the display is also good. But for gaming the battery loses fast. For video it lasts around 6 to 7 hours. Multitasking is also good. Writing this review after using it one day.
4,Nice üëå
4,"Weight and battery life
Rest is fine"
4,"Design is good, processor is good. Best laptop within this range. I got it in 36K from flipcart.
Cons.
-Switch on button taking more time to get activated
- Battery backup is only upto 3-4 hrs only."
4,HP laptop with i3 processor and 12 genaration is good for daily collage usage leval and window 11 is like something extra that makes a good thing even better
4,"Very good product uder 45k, display good but not best... battery capacity not sufficient for laptop.. otherwise design is very good and also backlit key board.. this price of range yea its a good laptop in my opinion."
4,"Performance, Display=Great
Build quality =not that good , sharp edge ,I have used electric tape
Battery=3 hour
Value for money , Maybe best at this price, 40k"

4,"very good item, smooth function"
4,Everything is good but battery backup quite low but enough
4,"Performance is good. Charge speed is great. Pretty lightweight.
Lacks a bit on battery backup.
Also it developed a noise from inside like a screw is loose or something. Plus now the LED keyboard red light that showed mute audio is not lighting up anymore.
Otherwise all good. But it was an overpriced purchase."
4,Good quality Product. Value For Money. I am writing a review After 10 days of Delivery. Battery backup 4 to 5 Hours.Performance is Good But sometime Small glitch are found.
4,Go for it
4,"It was amazing, i bought it for 50k in sale first look is fully impressed and come to performance it was soo cool . There is one disappoint that is bettary it exactly works 4 hours.this review is just 2 days only."
4,Awesome products. I am using this products for 5 day. I play game and do coding. It's performance is awesome. No lacking in game. But camera quality is poor.
4,"Very high performance laptop
Best for gaming and all other works"
4,It would be better to dual channel 16 instead of single channel.
4,"It is value for money..BUT couldve been better.
One major thing is, it should be mentioned that its single channel ram.
Bought the 16 gb ram variant thinking it would come with dual channel ram, but disappointed...only one stick of 16 gigs.
Rtx 3050...85w tgp is very good
i5 12450 is niicee
Display is meh. The 120 hz is nice.
No mux switch. But get a hybrid switch.

See the screen is pretty bright and have 100% sRGB color gamut, but in term of contrast it falls behind and not very appealing when one is consuming OTT content in a dark ambience lighting. And the laptop is pretty heavy.."
4,A great value. Bit heavy

Display is also very good .

Overall experience is very good , its a very powerful laptop in this budget.

Just go for it ...üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"
4,As of now it is working good
4,"I like this laptop. I shall update my comment after one month. Laptop design is mind-blowing
The display quality is not like HP/ Apple but, not like infinity either. No keyboard lights either.
But, you won't get 16GB RAM and 512 GB ROM either in other laptops"
4,Best experience for watching for movies in Dolby atmos. But it taking 3.30 hours for full charge. And you can use it continuously for 5 to 6 hrs only. Microsoft office is not pre installed and it is asking for premium to use
4,"One thing to note for anyone buying this .
The i5 13500hx doesn't disappoint along with the rtx 4050 gpu it can run most of the aaa games at 1080p with ease . The battery life is average as it's a gaming laptop.
The predator sense is something the acer needs to improve on the keyboard lighting setting doesn't apply sometimes. Overall id give an 8/10"
4,Looks good at first sight.
4,"touchpad should be redesigned, overall good laptop for performance tasks"
4,it was a nice product but windows is making it slow gaming experiance is nice
4,"Product is very good ,battery life up to 3-4hours"
4,This one is having 8 GB RAM only... Lag observed in NFS heat... If you search the requirements for this game you will see that 16 GB ram is required for smooth gameplay... Old games and GTA 5 etc worked fine... I sort of use it for office work and budget was tight... Light gaming as of now... All over budget friendly gaming laptop.... and HP laptops are known to last... I took HP because my old laptop lasted 8-10 years although there was continuous gaming... It was HP pavilion g4 notebook.
4,Good design
4,"Best in segment if you are gamer you can go for it if you have budget of 1 lakh
Display is nice brightness is awesome
Performance next level
Camera is average but it's fine we can manage"

Btw battery at silent mode is avg. If in performance mode then mkcüîã"
4,Display and performance is good . I tried only pubg yet . The bad think is battery backup and speakers are not louder enough .. even my iphone speakers feel louder than it . Otherwise its good . Performance feel good while laptop is charging but without charging its feel little slow when you open apps files.. but im satisfyied till now..

And Excellent Performance Product"

Got it for ~85k during BBD sale, and it's the most worth it deal ever. If anyone is planning to buy it, make sure to wait for some sale and get it below 90k.

The battery is decent, works for ~4 hours, but just plug it in everytime, it's a gaming laptop. And you get a 230W charging brick.

4,"Just for everyone's info this laptop has 4+4 gb ram sticks which I think that is not good as most of the users will surely be willing to upgrade the ram so they have to completely remove the existing rams and install new 8+8 or 16+16 sticks which I think is waste of money and also there's no extra storage slot so if you want to increase storage than you have to replace the existing SSD rest assured this is a very good deal if you bought it under 45k and also there are rumours about this lapto...

4,"The laptop's performance has been been top notch for the price but the only diappointment I have is with the battery life, since the laptop has no vram for any slightly intensive tasks the gpu kicks in effecting the battery life. I got upto 2:30hrs while playing a game and browsing, which is not that great considering the other options available. Also I installed a 1TB SSD in the second slot since the 512gb wouldn't be enough at all.All in all its a good laptop for the price."

But need to improve battery back up"
4,"It's a great product in terms of performance.
It's actually value for money product."
4,"Product is good bLenovo LOQ Ryzen 7 with 24GB RAM, all parts are genuine. The design is good-looking, and there are only minor heating issues. Otherwise, the battery capacity is decent, and charging is fast. Overall, it's great for editing purposes.

But Flipkart's delivery was terrible. I was really stressed out as it took many days for the product to arrive, and their response was not good either."
4,"This review will be detailed, covering everything about the Ryzen 5600H RX6500M variant.

Let's start with gaming performance:

Performance:
This laptop handles games well, but a major problem is occasional stuttering. It's not due to power, as the RX6500m is quite powerful (similar to an RTX 2050, sufficient for 1080p gaming). I believe it's because of the PCIe Gen 3 port limitation, as the Ryzen 5 only supports Gen 3 PCIe, and unfortunately, it can't be solved.

Display:
The 250 nits bright...

4,Overall good performance but only issue is battery.
4,"I didn't expect the Aspire series to give the laptop with 144hz display and 16 gb ram and 3050 gpu, but the laptop I have purchased has it all, I also owned an acer aspire 7 laptop with a 60hz display and the difference is visible. Happy with the purchase, will keep you all posted with a long term usage review."

4,Assume product but sometimes cooling fan makes noise.
4,"I bought this laptop during the Diwali Bajaj Finance offer for 45k. After one month of use, I can honestly say that the laptop's performance, design, and display are wonderful. However, I am disappointed with two things - the battery life and sound quality. The camera is okay and we were able to play normal games, but the battery drained in just two hours. Overall, I think it's a good value for money laptop."
4,"Performance is good i played games like valorant Lara croft no lag , screen drop but charge backup is less ."
4,"Nice üëç value for money. Display is good and also key is very smoothly press and very nice performance.

----Draw back ---
But only one draw back is speaker üîá sound is slow."
4,"Performance is High quality, display also top."
4,The battery lasts about 4-5 hours on balanced mode. The display is awesome. Watching content quality is good. Max 1TB ssd available. Microsoft 365 lifetime free. Speakers are good for a room. Not EVO CERTIFIED. Thunderbolt port not available. Metal build. Looks premium and slim. Type c charger. No heating problem. Using it for casual office work and content watching.
4,"Good cpu and gpu performance
Average battery
Good display ,colors are good but in dark image it shows display bleeding.
Build quality is okish .
Thermals are better than asus tuf in this budget.

4,Best laptop under 40k
4,Apart from heating issues the laptop is pretty osm
4,"Worth ? Yes at this price range, totally worth it I got this at 45k for 16/512 varient in big billion sale, after applying 5k off from HDFC debit card.... Performance is beast, it is up to date, display is good, customisation is also worth it... Just go for it."
4,"Display is Great, RGB Keyboard also but Battery and Speakers are down side for this laptop. Other than that smooth performance and value for money product."
4,"The overall design of the laptop is good, it looks great and it's built quality is very good as well.
I had a performance problem, I ordered the 16gb variant thinking that it will come in 8+8gb sticks (laptop performance is maximum if you use 2 same sticks in duar channel memory) but it came with only one 16gb ram which is making the laptop a little bit slow.
But the camera and mic are good and the processor for this price is a steal really but you have to take care of the thing I told earlie...

Don't ever try to install any cracked games especially from gameloop, then you will end up in the blue screen after restart and then you have to just reset the laptop like me which takes too long time, if you guys end up in the blue screen just turn on the laptop and press f9 key then choose reset pc."

4,"Looks good.. Build quality is solid.. very little flex. OLED Screen is awesome. cannot test the performance but RAM on this machine is of 7500 Mhz approx and best in class LPDDR5X
Speakers are not loud enough. Expected the speakers like previous lenovo laptop but the front firing speakers on this model is just average or below-average..
Feels slight sensation while charging due to metal body.
All this is based on 2 day usage.."

4,"Best in this price range. Battery backup is decent (unlike other reviews. And it depends on usage and optimisation)
2-3 cons that I noticed ( rest everything is perfect for me):
1. Speakers are not loud but it's a not a big thing for me, I can use external speakers.
2. During gaming, heats a bit around the keyboard area as the air flows through the keyboard into the fans and gets out of the bottom.
3. Wish it would have additional storage capacity for one more ssd"
4,I loved this one... First laptop of my life and I'm fully satisfied with it except battery.
4,Overall the product i received was value for money but the only con i faced was its speakers.
4,Best laptop ever for beginners üòÄ
4,"Was good, occasionally sucks, that's because I use really heavy apps such as abaqus, fusion 360, MATLAB, ansys for my research, I play GTA V too. No lag, it's really smooth. Not 10/10 but 9.2/10, I am a heavy user my laptop is on all the time 16 GB Ram and i5 gaming processor at this price was just perfect.
I use external hard disk so, SSD is at its optimal speed"

I've also set up video calls through its very basic webcam, and it didn't crash either. The speakers aren't the greatest, so you'll have to rely on external wired / wireless speakers.

4,"For those who are thinking about performance of Intel N100, be assured that this is a 12th Gen processor and performs at par with Intel i5 gen 8 laptop processors. So I would say pretty good.
Day to day tasks like browsing and media consumption are a breeze, I could also do light photoshop and illustrator on this, thanks to the 6400Mhz DDR5 RAM.
Build quality is good. Although everything is plastic but that is expected at this price point. No squeaking or poorly aligned panels.

It has a USB type-C port, a 3.5 mm audio jack and a slot for memory card. I have used it for around 9 hours and approx. 50% battery is used. It has 64 GB RAM, the OS occupie...

But it sure is a great asset for simple daily activities such as surfing, emailing and some conferencing from home. Display is so-so and hence if that is important for you, then advise to go for a higher end laptop. But for this price point this is a very good buy. If you need the experience of your Android ...

4,I like most things about this laptop. But the main thing I dislike about it is the display. Although everything is crisp and clear the screen has a lot of screen bleeding. It's only noticeable when the screen is dark when you're in a dark room. If you're buying this laptop expect screen bleeding. If it doesn't bother you then it's a solid pick.

And you will feel it right away, even when you want to type something or when you try to change the volume when playing media. So, performance suffers badly. Do not expect to play any 3D games. It also suffers badly in some 2D games, but you will be able to play most non-fancy 2D games at playable frame rates.

Vantage, the control system of lenovo needs much modification like asus.
They should give an update of some kind of student mode in which the battery use should be most efficient for tasks which wont use much cpu or gpu. they already have a quite more, but that also doesn't extend the battery life to the extent needed.

## Reviewing again after 1 month

Going strong, no problems at all. Using it with Windows 11 is fine. I get around 6 to 8 hours of battery life with normal web browsing and other light tasks.

After installing Ubuntu, the battery backup reduced to 2 to 3 hours. But after installing autocpu-freq, I am getting almost the same battery backup of around 6 hours

Go for it if you are under budget

4,"Overall laptop is good. Few important points whoever is going to purchase:
1. Ram is not upgradable
2. Type-C port doesn't support display, only Data+Power (This means your type-c dock will also not work for display, you may try display link docks but they are too costly)
3. Webcam and speakers are very average.

Performance, overall design, keyboard and display are good in this price range. I bought 16GB model around 35K. Tried Fedora linux, everything worked out of the box."

I do some light editing tasks too on photoshop and illustrator, works fine, probably because mine is 16gb ram varient. Battery could've been slightly better, though it works well. Overall, Its a balanced budget laptop, atleast better than other budget laptops of established brands who don't give bigger mousepad and backlit keyboard in this price, MSI modern 14 has it."

Gaming at 1080p high settings runs smoothly too games like gta5,tomb raider etc but you do have to connect adaptor if you are gaming
Design is sturdy and at par or better than most of the laptop at this range
Battery is really disappointing tho hardly 2-3 hours at basis task like web browsing at 30% bri...

4,"Chrome OS is worst in terms of Document editing tasks as everything needs to be done online through Google Docs, Slides or Sheets... Many useful android apps are not optimised for this OS...MS Office (android version) can not be found and downloaded from the Google play store.
Overall the Chromebook is only good for multimedia consumption. Tabs are much better than these so-called Chromebooks."
4,Price is according to quality üëçüèª
4,Truly value for money. Sleek and cool design. Good battery. Display is not too good. But cool as per the price. Microsoft Office 365 from Google Play supported. Only issue is with editing a word document downloaded from doc is complex. You need to upload it in onedrive and then you can edit through Microsoft word. Good sound.
4,Everything is Perfect according to the price!! But the only problem is that the Chromebook hits a lil bit!! Overall a good Chromebook for Study Purpose like Mocks Online Studies and Multimedia Consumption !! ‚≠ê ‚≠ê ‚≠ê ‚≠ê !!

4,"The laptop is 2 kg and thin, which can contribute to its heating issues.

The Colorful XS 22 is a solid choice for those seeking a powerful laptop at a reasonable price. Its performance is top-notch, but the heating issues could be a concern for some users. If you're willing to manage the heat, it's a great option.

Would I recommend it? Yes, with the caveat that users should be prepared to address the heating issue, perhaps by using a cooling pad or adjusting usage habits."
4,Cooling needs work maybe cooling paste issue will see after repasting overall good product
4,Comes without MS Office. Win 11 shows flawless performance on this HW. Non tech users may face thermal issues. But these can be easily fixed. Overall I'm satisfied with this purchase.

Battery is ok.
Terrible speakers, not for media consumption.
I use this laptop for programming which is a great deal at this price."

It is absolutely not a product you need unless you want a toy or like in my case it suits your needs.

4,Good at all.

4,The biggest use case for a laptop is probably as a portable workstation they can be carried to office or to college. This laptop has to be powerful enough to get work done fast. It should be a device with a healthy battery back up and at the same time not too bulky. And it helps immensely if it‚Äôs easy on the wallet. HP‚Äôs new laptop called HP 14s is a product that tries to condense all the above-mentioned requirements . I am very happy.

Not sure if it has RAM or hard disk upgradable or slot for another hard disk that is why one star less else it is nothing less than 5 STAR...."
4,"I'll be honest n critique this product as for it is.
The build is not premium it is just the finish n touch that looks premium, but actually, don't be a typical fan and observe that the display screen and the hinge are of poor quality, which has a high amount of push n bending. Which is scary. Get Asus. Lenovo!
Samsung is just a brand name."

Only drawback i found was the display.. if there is light on it glares too much and also the viewing angle of the screen is very poor while watching videos.. the slightest change in angle of viewing the screen makes images look like a photo negative on the screen.. it can't be used with heavy apps just for entertainment purpose mainly for kids, better than giving phone. Touch is not very responsive but does the job.. end story is for the price range...

5,The battery life was as short-lived as my relationship. Listening to Arjit Singh songs on full volume since then still isn't getting over. Has more warmth than her.

To be honest was little bit nervous for this expensive thing
Its a portable PC within it
Superbly good for travellers who love gaming and for normal gaming stuff too
Pair it with a controller and its a pc that can be your PlayStation
Overall awesome
Recommend buying an SD card of 1 TB so that you get seamless space for multiple beefy games"
5,"This has performed beyond my expectations. If you are confused between Steamdeck and Rog Ally, go for this as this is All in one pocket gaming machine."
5,"I always wanted something like this for a long time and since steam deck is not officially sold in India this is the next best thing. It can play all PC games with ease, and you can play for hours (if the charger is plugged in) since it's easy to hold. The display and speakers are so amazing, and I don't think you can find a gaming laptop for the same price that offers the same experience.

It's new architecture Apu is awesome, in almost 90 percent of games I get avg of 50 to 60 fps more over it's portable i can carry it anywhere.

Best thing about this device I can do even coding also literally,since its a windows platform you can do whatever you want with it, like you do with a windows laptop or a pc.

If you watch movies and you you do browsing and all literally you can get 7 to 8 hrs of backup...

5,"Great Product, Really enjoying since its arrival
Thank you Asus"
5,"The product itself is amazing. The only issue is that the OS isn't optimised for a handheld console. I hope that in the future we get more updates that streamline the OS for a better experience. Performance is great, no complaints there, the battery life isn't a lot but it's expected for the price. I'll recommend buying it only if you already have a laptop or a PC and a console. If this is your first gaming device, I'd recommend buying a PlayStation 5 instead."
5,"Absolute level.
Only con in my opinion is it's battery."
5,"The product is amazing. This review is after using the Ally for 2 weeks. Runs all my games really well, and avg 45 FPS at mid settings easily. Batter life is short about 1 hour of intense gameplay, which is in no way bad considering the performance. Out the box, I experienced some performance issues and crashes, but all of them went away after a few system updates. Now runs smooth as butter."
5,"Initial impression is positive. It's quite good at what it's made for. I am still learning it as it's my first Windows handheld. Battery life is as good as new laptop so only time will tell.

Will post here for any update/issues."

5,- as of now the device is performing as expected. It's absolutely a revolutionary hand held device (except for the battery backup). However it is recommended to buy it on sale as asus rog ally x is already launched. Also please note that you might get expired warranty status on registering the product. You will have to upload invoice details to get a correct waranty status on asus website.

Also, playing some games on low or medium settings does not hamper the quality of the games. You can still play it on high settings but on this screen they all look good. If you wanna conserve battery then do some tinkering, find a mix of medium to low settings of games and then enjoy. Otherwise connect the charger, go...

This laptop targets customers who do not care about brand value. I don't know how about the after sell service of colorful but now the laptop is very good at this point.

Pros:-
1. Intel i5 12 gen.

4. DDR5 Ram

Cons:-
1. Some heating issues."

The laptop's display was clear and vibrant, offering excellent color accuracy and sharpness. Gaming performance is also outstanding with rtx4050. Battery backup around 2.5 to 3 hours but also considered it's gaming laptop."

The screen produces accurate colours, paradise for gamers, with little screen bleeding issue.
I5 12500h teamed up with Rtx 4050 6gb is a monster.
Far cry 6 in ultra settings produces avg 92fps easily in entertainment mode and 111fps in performance mode.
Yes a common heating issue is present, I solved it with a cooling pad.
Best bye ever üëç"

5,"Best performance in this price range. 13th gen i5 with 4050 is good enough for 1080p ultra graphics gaming. Fans are a bit loud as they rotate at 8000rpm! But it keeps the temps low. 512gb SSD is a low storage if gaming is considered as games nowadays are min 40gb in size.

Packaging was good.

Overall, go for it if your budget is around 75k.
And don't forget to add another 16GB RAM and extra M.2 SSD for better performance. (Both slots are available)"

Boots up fast, works really fast H series processors are at par with Desktop processors in performance and handling."

This laptop is perfect for students as it does not disappoint in any part..
Coming to the display It is good for binge watching and colors produced looks good because of the Samsung color engine.
Speakers are downfiring which could be better but it is audible.
And the build quality is good and sturdy as the top lid is made up of metal..
Now the performance part is very subjective as it has intel 13th gen CPU it will not disappoint you in any...

5,"The processor is too much powerful. Laptop design is good. The rtx 2050 4gb gpu is a little bit less but, at this price segment it is the best. Other important things to mentions are MSI apps are good and feature rich to manage the laptop. Like we can prolong battery life setting the max charging limit to 80% or 60%. Audio is clear and loud. Display is solid and beautiful."

Performance is amazing thanks to the inclusion of the PCIe NVMe SSD. Boot Up time is less than 15 seconds. And the 6 Core Intel Core i3 1215U also does a fantastic job in the performance department. The fingerprint sensor is a nice addition and it's extremely fast as well. The only thing that I didn't like is the display. Although the display...

The camera is not good as in all laptops. Looks like macbook air and superfast start in 8-10 sec and fingerprint is also fast and good.

5,One of the stylish and high performance laptop in this price range. Really liked it.
5,"With Realme Book Slim, the company is entering the laptop segment in India. In its first attempt, Realme has got off to a good start with excellent design and screen on the Realme Book Slim. The performance is good too and as an overall package - we can recommend the Realme Book Slim. The lack of a 16GB RAM variant in India and limited ports are a couple of letdowns, but if that‚Äôs not a deal-breaker for you, the Realme Book Slim won‚Äôt disappoint you.

Got it for 41k during BBD sale and can say, easily the best laptop for MY needs.

5,Processor is good i7 P series which is considered a good trade-off as H series processor produce a lot of heat and thus reduce the life of the device. Dropped the plan for HP pavilion plus as OLED panels are developing defects after sometime of blue dots as read online from the reviews of the users. Can go for this product if you are getting under 65K definitely. Display settings can be tweaked and shouldn't be much of issue.

Except non possibilty of adding RAM and another SATA SSD, everything what you expect is available there. Only one thing, the office version 2021 does not come with Outlook (old). So, customers who wants to store email messages in form of .pst folder, will feel frustated. I had my old Office 2016 pro...

The experience was so good, I purchased the product from a big billion sale with a heavy discount.

5,"It's a good product. I would suggest the following for the better life of the device:

1) Use it with an external fan, elevated (To provide max outage for heat so your device remain cool)
2) Always keep an eye on the charging percentage and as it reaches to max(100%), remove the charger without fail (Avoid overcharging)."

It's slim and Light weight too.
As it is i3 12th 1215u processor the performance is snappy so far...and Battery back up is Good it's like around 4 to 5 hours.
Coming to Display it is Good but viewing angles are not great, as it is TN panel still it is Good.

5,Very good laptop
5,"I got this laptop in 32k , which is best laptop in price range and the DELL always is one of the best company to trust"
5,Who cares about big specs when you have a big support like dell. If you guys are having some speaker issue call dell they are so helpful. The speaker is not an issue as its a software issue and not the speaker. Speed is great due to ssd . Everything is perfect if you are student or a business man. If you are a gamer then this is not the budget you need to have in your wallet to get a laptop.

5,"Got the laptop for 67k at offer, Cons that I found are battery and speaker.Battery lasts about 3-3.5hrs while watching movie.But it has rapid charging which charges the laptop within just minutes.
NB:Check for battery drain while gaming even though the laptop is charging. I faced this issue while playing rdr2 in ultra settings. The problem is with the 170 w adapter which is not enough for this machine. Just ask customer support and they will send 230w one. I had asked for replacement and they...

5,"Got this laptop for 65k during sale.
The display is 100% srgb and really bright.
The Speakers are what you expect from a gaming laptop. Just okay.
The processor is 12th gen but it works for me
Now for the graphic card, I have only played PUBG on high settings and its giving me between 110-120 fps.
I cannot say anything about the battery life for now as i have not checked how long it can last without charging. I have seen reviews for other LOQ laptops and expect atleast 2 hours.
Also the boot ...

5,Powerful Machine! Just go for it. As of now no issues found
5,"Its a beast!! Awesome performance.
The display is amazing 100% srgb. But the speakers are not much loud. And also there's the battery drain issue while doing heavy tasks and gaming. It could resolve by getting a 230w power adapter. They could have gave the RGB keyboard instead of just Backled keyboard. The camera is below average,its a 720p camera."
5,Amazing product! It has many latest features .One of the amazing features is the webcam shield. The laptop works smoothly. It is a good purchase.
5,Product is good at this price range.

5,it's Fabulous Thank U Flipkart.
5,This chromebook is simply awesome.
5,Good product. Working good condition. Value of money
5,It‚Äôs a chromebook. Great for basic tasks. Can install VS code and run python (under Linux Dev mode). ARM processor makes it great for android emulation. Touchscreen was a surprise. Chromebook benefits not available in India so beware of that.

5,Nice laptop loved it üòÉ
5,"Great performance
Good thermals
Average screen ( good considering its a gaming laptop)
The 4050 works good
Battery can last upto 4 hrs from 100 to 0 ( considering u have only opened 2 to 3 applications and have brightness around 40 with backlit off)"
5,"It is definitely worth it.
Price : you are getting 4050 and i5 12th gen at a good price range.
Battery: have a mux switch,but still it's a gaming laptop so don't expect much.
Display: not the best one out there but it is sufficient for most tasks."
5,Fantastic performance. First time using RTX GPU laptop. Great features like nvidia broadcast. Display is great with 100% sRGB. Battery is also ok compared to IdeaPad gaming laptops but not great. Design is sleek with all the ports and vents on the backside. Overall no problem till now. Also DLSS 3.0 is future proof.
5,"Everything is going fine, BUT, THE BATTERY its absolutely üí©...... the most it can give u is 1hr 45mins...THAT TOO only when the screen is JUST ON and i am not doing anything......om normal use, it will just give you around 1 hour. Rest, performance etc is good"

It's extremely fast for editing as well. Overall it's great value for money. I highly recommend it. There's no screen bleeding either. However if you use it on a bed it does get heated.

5,This laptop is a great deal if you can get it for less than 1.1 lakh. Good gaming performance from the RTX 4060 with a crisp bright display
5,Processor is beast. Game playing is smooth. Display is awesome. Battery backup is bit less but thanks to fast charging which fully charge the laptop in an hour. Overall best laptop at this price range.

Usage : MATLAB 2023, BLENDER , ADOBE PHOTOSHOP.
MY take : It is easily able to handle Matlab and CPU oriented task, (I had speculation before purchase as getting an i9 13th gen at that price). .
Blender is using GPU to its core and probably if you are looking for heavy GPU tasks that you may look for a laptop with dedicated chip.
It can handle CPU oriented heavy tasks easily but GPU's only basic one's.

I haven't expected the performance it actually provides whether it is battery, gaming, multitasking or anything it just performs so well that you can't complain. The only thing I would not appreciate is the weight, it has 1.8kg of weight which is little on the higher side, it could be the best if it could come under 1.5kgs. Overall it's the best out there available on the market."
5,"Very good product at this price range (55k) . Display, performance, style everything is superb. If you trust this brand just go for it .
Battery backup is also nice.
But the charger looks like cheap quality , should have provided a good type c charger."
5,Amazing Laptop in this budget
5,"It's fantastic.
You can have i9 13th Gen. 32GB Ram and 1TB SSD in such a low price. Aluminium metal body and others are the plus.
I got it in below 50K. (Lower than the processor market price)
I don't know how, but they are doing a very good job.

Now Cons:
1. No dedicated service stations.
2. A QR code is on keyboard side for the same.
Very disappointed with the service centre the way they planned.

Rest it is a Good choice.

Definitely go for it if you want a budget friendly laptop with good performance. I work with 3D modelling and some coding, I am satisfied so far.

Only cons:
1. Display gets heated due to the exhaust vents.
2. Battery is not so good.
3. Not very good for gaming, but can do mid range gaming."

Display is good for me, as I wear spectacles, I dont require more shining display. Perormance wise laptop is very good as it has 16 GB RAM. I purchased it in 43k in sale days, so in this range I would say this laptop is superb for me with its high end specifications. 5 star for this laptop."

Turns out Acer Nitro with Rtx3070ti Is cheaper than this model , NVIDIA has tricked us by giving inferior hardware compared to last generation(Rtx30 series) and just adding software upgrades to make games run smoother(DLSS )

5,The performance of this laptop is top
5,asom product
5,"Everything is good but the chief complaints are :

Plastic Body : Acer makes metal laptops for quite cheap price
Bad Speakers : Too low volume, Asus Rog has best speakers I have heard so far in a laptop
Bad Battery : My old Acer which is almost 6 years old has better battery backup than this.
Rest all is good. The best part is the screen. Looks almost like amoled.
Performance is very good.

Advise: Look for Rog Strix g15 as a second option"

Design and Build Quality
Although the body is made of polycarbonate, the quality feels solid, and I like the sleek, minimalistic design. It doesnt have that gimmicky feel that some gaming laptops do.

Laptop performance is top notch, cooling also mind blowing,it kept temp under 65*C even after playing GTA 5 for 4hrs in highest settings (very high/ultra).

Provided 4.5hrs of battery backup while casual web surfing as well as doing microsoft exel sheets and still 10% left.

5,Really value for money product!!
5,Great laptop and its performance is really really great but speaker sound is low
5,I have purchased this Lenovo IdeaPad slim 5 i7 13 th gen processor 16GB Ram 512GB Awesome.. best deal on Republic day of India sale. 70k very wow price. Thanks to Flipkart. But delay in delivery. I have waited for additional 5 days after promising date.
5,"I am happy about the build quality and performance. Speakers are low and the battery comes around 4hrs. I feel it's okay for the price, coz i7 13th gen H series processor and 512 sdd. No other laptop has these specs at this price.
16 inches is a lot better than 14 inches so go for 16 Inches model."
5,"Amazing Laptop.
This year's Ryzen 7000 zenbooks are 6 core while this is 8 cores. Lesser price and better performance on CPU + GPU.

Pros:
1. Fantastic best in class screen
2. Look and feels premium AF
3. Most games play well although this is not a gaming laptop (I tried Dota 2, Asphalt and Crusader Kings)
4. CPU usage is minimal on pre installed apps

Cons:
1. For some reason wifi disconnects at times. Maybe a driver issue."
5,"JUST GOT IT YESTERDAY, LOOKS AND FEELS VERY PREMIUM, THE PANNEL OPENS UP WITH JUST ONE HAND , DISPLAY IS AMAZING ‚ú®(ASUS OLED) .TRIED GTA V HAD NO ISSUE 40-45 FPS. GOOD CHARGING SPEED. FULL CHARGE LASTED ABOUT MORE THAN 4 HOURS OF MOVIE WATCH. THE LAPTOP SLEEVE PROVIDED INSIDE THE BOX FEELS PREMIUM TOO. ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. SOUND COULD BE BETTER,ITS VERY LOW QUALITY REST EVERYTHING IS AMAZING."
5,"Awesome Laptop just got it yesterday, I am very happy with the display and performance. But I was really upset for the speaker because the default settings which came with laptop had very low sound on speaker. So I researched and find out that there is an app inbuilt called DTS where you have to select custom audio to actually get the full sound of the speaker (by default it will be on music mode). Check if it's working for you :)"

5,"I've been using the Acer One for a few weeks now, and it's quite impressive. The compact design is a major plus, making it easy to carry around. The IPS display is surprisingly bright and vivid, something you don't usually find in laptops under this price range. It can offer a decent 5 hours on a single charge with regular work and browsing.

The typing experience is a bit of a mixed, it's somewhere between chicklet and mechanical but that hasn't been a deal-breaker for me.

1.speaker quality is superb, but the loudness is comparable to a phone speaker. (3 Stars for speakers)

2. Battery charging speed is excellent, but battery backup is not; even in balance mode, battery backup is around 6 hr+ (due to the laptop resolution being too high (2880x1800). If you use this laptop at 1920x1200 resolution, you may easily get 8 hr+ of battery life. (4 Stars for battery life)

3.Slight heating (it's obviously ...

5,"Its been a week since I started using the laptop. Its very good , Light weight , Super fast finger Print , Display is great , Key board is great.


Lets come to main part of heating issue . Personally i did not experience any kind of heating issue . Not sure why others are facing it . I am very happy about it . Hence i consider the laptop as a great valie for money . Only issue is speaker which is below average"
5,"Such a great laptop. I got it for 52k after all card offers and additional discounts. The display is top notch, Performance is great, fingerprint is also fast, boot up time is also very less, speaker quality is decent, Battery backup is also good, Heats up because it is a complete aluminium body but it is good as heat is being dissipated, cooling fans works completely fine and runs at fast speed in case of heating."
5,Best laptop for student
5,"It's such a wonderful device. Metal build is very sturdy. i5 13500H processor, 512 GB SSD, 16GB DDR5 RAM makes Performance top notch. No heating issues. Heats slightly while charging but thats acceptable with 100 watt charging. Screen is OLED with HDR certification and FHD+ resolution and 90 Hz. Emits less blue light too (TUV Rheinland Certified).

5,"The product is good enough for light work, learning and handling small tasks. The best laptop in budget. I got it for somewhere around 25K during flipkart sale and of course it is more than worth.

A last thing plss buy a cooling pad because it heat a little."
5,It's a good Loptop
5,"Everything is good except few things.
1. Laptop is heating more than other laptop due to metal body only while charging.
2. Trackpad could me larger.
3. Loudness is okay but speaker quality can be improved.

Solution:
1.Update drivers and windows to the latest version.
2. Remove unused preloaded softwares like Mcafee antivirus, default microsoft apps, Acer software.

After going above steps, laptop is easy to use."
5,"Bought it on 19 June.
Using it for almost a month now...display is great... sometimes some apps create nuisance but that's ok as they are not well optimised.

5,"A value for money chromebook, with a decent enough configuration.

There is sw update support till 2033 or so. With 8 GB Ram and 256GB SSD, it should last for that period, for those who use this mainly as consumers.

For a student on computer science course, this can do for the most part except for heavy GPGPU or NPUGPU stuff.

For those who create stuff be it coding or multimedia, this can be used in a pinch, if needed, but ideally a more powerful configuration will be better."

It does everything."
5,"The laptop works very well and I have bought this laptop by seeing the best specs and the laptop is worth it. The processor is core i5 1335u not 1355u. And the 16:10 display is immersive. Also good because it is upgradable up to 64GB RAM and 4TB SSD. It has all necessary slots including RJ45.
BEST FOR CODING AND ENTERTAINMENT."

One more thing is that, the heating problem. Yes of course it has a heating problem because it's a 14 inch laptop and your laptop ventilation is on the back Better if you use a laptop stand to overcome it.
It is a light-weight laptop. That is also a significant work from HP. ...

Performance was good
Build quality was good
Keyboard experience was good
Every one say it has heating issue but I will tell you one thing is it got metal body build than regular laptops competition so it shows much heat while touching the back surface due to that
I have been using asus too same configuration it also dissipates heat
One thing I found my new wireless mouse was not detecting it"
5,"Awesome product..
At this price point it is the best laptop so far.

Pros-
Awesome display

Decent battery life ( 4-5 hours )

Camera Led Light is a unique feature and serves it's purpose.

Backlight keyboard at this price.

Quick boot up (12-15 seconds)

Light weight.

Nice built quality.

Cons-

Sometimes power button needs to be press 2 times to boot."
5,"Except the Touchpad placement/size. You will like everything about this laptop.

One more thing is the lights near the camera is worthless and appears cheap. It doesn‚Äôt lighten up your face but the room üòÇ"

But one thing the Camera quality is bit poor but manageable.
I can say if you are running tight with your wallet, you can pick this new comer. Thanks"
5,"Nice Product üëå
Go for it blindly üòç
It's screen quality is awesome at this price point because it has 100% sRGB and a LCD panel in which viewing angle are surprisingly good
Battery backup is around 4-5 hours at moderate usage.
Backlit keyboard is awesome ü•≥
Speakers quality is decent, bass is missing üôÇ
Slimmest laptop as claimed by Infinix.üíØ
Charging is pretty fast ( It tooks 1 hours to charge 75%)

By default sound is low and graphics are on AMD mode but if you made settings in DTS: X(Sound ) and Armoury (Graphics) you will get the best-expected results. Sound quality and display quality are not so good I can say it is average.

Performance has been good so far, the CPU gets quite warm under full load but tweaking around a bit with the power/current/voltage settings helped drop the temperatures down to under 75 C whereas previously it would go 90+. I lost around 10% performance in the process but the drop in temperature is worth the slight performance trade-off.

Gaming is quite not possible in battery mode, game starts lagging you need to connect it to power to play

It's suitable for standard video and photo editing tasks. However, for users engaging in intensive video editing, it is advisable to choose the 512GB storage option due to the slower SSD speed of the 256GB model. Overall, considering the features and performance at this price point, it's a compelling deal."

In terms of productivity, this laptop can handle it very well. Comes with MS office 2021 and 170 W charger. Battery backup is 5-6 hrs with quiet and igpu mode on and screen brightness set to 50%. Overall, it's a value for money laptop for students and working professionals as well."

Viewing angles

Use Rufus GPT to create a bootable disk. Doesn't need to install any drivers from the internet. Just give windows update.

while installing windows if the cursor doesn't show up, change the touchpad option to basic in F2 BIOS menu. After installing change it back to advanced to enjoy touchpad gestures."
